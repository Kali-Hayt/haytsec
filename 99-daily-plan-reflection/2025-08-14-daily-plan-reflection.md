## 🌤 Morning Reflection

This morning I feel very rested and focused on preparing for the Fall semester by cleaning up and organizing my Obsidian setup. I feel motivated and am looking forward to starting this new chapter when the semester begins on August 25th. I also created an Obsidian Sync account so I can keep my work updated between both systems throughout the Fall semester.
