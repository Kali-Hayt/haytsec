- ⚠️ Investigated rogue DHCP, ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, botnets  
- 🧱 Reinforced concepts: VLAN hopping, STP behavior, DHCP process (DORA), IPv4/IPv6  
- 📊 Clarified recovery metrics: RPO (data loss tolerance), RTO (recovery speed)  
- 🧠 Completed all labs and quizzes with full accuracy:  
  - ✅ Module Quiz 9.6 (25/25)  
  - ✅ Checkpoint Review 9.7 (20/20)
 

- **Risk assessment** isn’t theoretical—it’s a blueprint for action. The threats are real, and unpatched systems are open doors.
- Honeypots offer more than deception—they provide **insight** into attacker behavior before real assets are touched.
- Compliance is not just paperwork. **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and data locality laws *shape infrastructure decisions*.
- Encryption supports all states of data — **at rest**, **in transit**, and **in use** — but must be paired with access control and integrity checks.
- A strong grasp of **vulnerability vs exploit vs threat actor** helps prioritize mitigation, not just detection.
- **Behavioral threat research** = Studies how attackers behave (like TTPs), not just what tools they use.
- **Internal threats** = Come from inside the org (employees).  
  **External threats** = Come from outside (hackers).
- **DDoS** = Floods systems to shut them down.  
  **DRDoS** = Uses spoofed IP to reflect large traffic at the victim.
- **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** = Stealthy, long-term attack to stay hidden and steal data.
- **Botnets** = Infected devices controlled remotely. Usually created by malware with backdoors.
- **Malware payload** = What the malware actually *does* (e.g., steal data, delete files).
- **Spoofing** = Faking identity (IP, MAC, etc.) to hide attacker or mislead systems.
- **Footprinting** = General info (like DNS, IPs).  
  **Fingerprinting** = Specific info (like OS or services running).
- **PUPs / PUAs** = Unwanted software that sneaks in during installs (e.g., toolbars, adware).
- Most attacks aim to **steal data**, not improve performance or security.
- **MAC Flooding**: Overload switch MAC table → switch acts like a hub  
- **ARP Poisoning**: Fake ARP replies → traffic sent to attacker  
- **DHCP Starvation**: Take all IPs → clients get no address  
- **Rogue DHCP**: Attacker gives out fake IP settings  
- **On-Path Attack**: Attacker sits between two systems (MITM)  
- **Sniffing**: Capture traffic using tools like Wireshark  
- **VLAN Hopping**: Exploit native VLANs or double-tag frames  
- **MAC Spoofing**: Change your MAC address to look like someone else  
- **STP**: Stops loops in the network, not a security tool  
- **Port Security**: Limits MACs per port to block flooding  

✅ Tools used: Ettercap, Wireshark  
✅ Focus: Layer 2 attacks (Switch level)

- **Rogue Devices**: Unapproved devices create new attack surfaces.
- **DHCP Starvation**: Floods DHCP server with fake requests → no IPs left.
- **Rogue DHCP**: Can give clients fake gateways → traffic rerouted to attacker.
- **DNS Spoofing**: Sends false replies to DNS queries → user lands on fake site.
- **DNS Cache Poisoning**: Inserts fake DNS records into a server’s cache.

### 🔍 Detection & Impact
- **HOSTS File**: Can override DNS; suspicious entries = red flag.
- **Common Signs**: Unexpected redirects, weird entries in HOSTS, wrong IP configs.

### 🧪 Tools & Techniques
- **Ettercap**: Launch DNS spoofing + ARP poisoning
- **Test Sites**: Use known-good sites like `rmksupplies.com` to verify redirection

## ✍️ Morning Journal / Reflection

I feel well-rested this morning and prepared to make consistent progress. My primary objective today is to complete **Network+ Lesson 9**, maintaining my daily pace of one lesson per day.

This approach is designed to ensure all content is covered ahead of schedule, allowing ample time to focus on review and exam preparation prior to the **August 15th final exam**. If time permits, I intend to dedicate additional focus to either the **HaytSec project** or ongoing **Hack The Box** exercises.

## 🌙 Late Evening Reflection  

Today, I successfully completed **Network+ Lesson 9**, dedicating over seven hours to focused study and hands-on labs. The effort required sustained attention and discipline, but I’m pleased with the outcome and the depth of material covered.

With the lesson now complete, I plan to utilize the remainder of the evening to resume progress on my current **Hack The Box** engagement, continuing from where I left off earlier this week.
