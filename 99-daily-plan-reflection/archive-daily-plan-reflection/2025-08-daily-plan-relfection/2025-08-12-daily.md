## 🔥 Focus of the Day

## 🌤️ Morning Journal

I had a good rest this morning and started the day by doing Windows updates and some cleanup tasks to get everything in order. I’m feeling solid and motivated to continue reviewing for the Network+ final exam.

## 🌙 Early Evening Journal

Most of the early evening, after lunch, I decided to rest and recharge so I could come back feeling clearer and more energized. The goal: get into some deep subnetting and subnet mask drills, and push for that “lightbulb moment” breakthrough.

For the rest of the evening, aside from the drills, I plan to watch two or three CompTIA training modules before wrapping up for the night and preparing for the next day.

## 🌙 Late Evening Journal

I’ve been practicing IPv4 subnetting and it’s finally starting to click — more lightbulbs turning on with each round of drills. Tomorrow morning, I’ll hit it again for a short focused session, then move on to practicing IPv6 and MAC addressing. After that, I’ll dive into my CompTIA training videos.

The final exam is coming up on Thursday, and possibly Friday if needed, so I want to go in sharp. My goal is to start early tomorrow with a clear mind and move faster than I did today.
