## 11.1.1 Network Security Zones

### 🧱 What Are Network Security Zones?

- A **zone** is a logically segmented section of a network where all hosts share the same security configuration and **level of trust**.
- Zones are defined at Layers 2 and 3, often through **VLANs** and **subnets**.
- Think of each zone like a **room in a building**: each room has a different purpose and security clearance. You need permission to move between rooms.

> 🔍 Traffic between zones must be routed — it doesn't happen automatically like traffic within the same VLAN. Firewalls or proxies enforce these boundaries.

---

### 🧱 Why Segment Into Zones?

- Segmentation **limits attack surfaces** by confining hosts to specific areas.
- It **controls lateral movement** — malware or attackers can’t move freely between zones.
- Rules and security policies vary based on the **trust level** of the zone.

> 📦 Imagine each zone like a secure shipping container. You can't just move a package (data) from one to another without going through customs (firewall rules).

## 🧱 Trust Levels and Zone Control

- **High-trust zones** → tightly monitored, minimal access, minimal surface area.
- **Low-trust zones** → exposed to many users/devices, higher risk, more restrictions.
  
> 🛡️ Think of trust like airport security:
> - Private networks = staff-only gates with background checks.
> - Guest zones = general terminal access with limited privileges.

## ✅ Common Security Zones

- **Private Server Administrative Networks**
  - Most secure.
  - Used by admins only.
  - Devices hardened and continuously monitored.
  
- **Private Client Network**
  - Medium-high trust.
  - Devices follow security policies.
  - But diverse users = more risk.

- **Guest**
  - Low trust.
  - Unmanaged personal devices allowed.
  - Strict restrictions, no access to trusted networks.

- **Public Server Network**
  - Public-facing services (e.g., web servers).
  - Partially trusted: devices are managed, but open to public access.

- **Public**
  - Least secure.
  - Completely untrusted and unmanaged.

## 🔐 Why Zones Matter (Practical Example)

If a remote access Trojan lands on a marketing VLAN:
- Without segmentation, it could **jump** to finance servers.
- With proper zone segmentation + firewall policies:
  - The malware hits a wall.
  - It can’t escape its container.

> 📬 Like dropping a poisoned letter in one mailbox — it won’t affect the others unless someone **physically moves** it to another locked box.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Zones = broadcast domains with shared trust and security posture.
- Zones are enforced with firewalls/proxies to control inter-zone traffic.
- Proper segmentation minimizes risk, limits breach scope, and enforces policy based on trust.
