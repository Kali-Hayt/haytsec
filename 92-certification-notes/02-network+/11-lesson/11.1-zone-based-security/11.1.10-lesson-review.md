# QUESTION 1

You're concerned about attacks directed at your network firewall. You want to be able to identify and be notified of any attacks. In addition, you want the system to take immediate action to stop or prevent the attack, if possible.

Which tool should you use?

❌ Packet sniffer  
✅ IPS  
❌ IDS  
❌ Port scanner  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Packet sniffer** – Only captures and analyzes packets passively; it won’t alert you or stop attacks.
- ❌ **IDS** – Can detect and alert on suspicious traffic, but it **doesn't take action** to stop the attack.
- ❌ **Port scanner** – Used to discover open ports/services on a network, **not for protection or prevention**.

# QUESTION 2

Which of the following servers should be placed in a perimeter network?

❌ File servers used exclusively by internal employees  
✅ Web servers providing public access services  
❌ Database servers containing sensitive information  
❌ Internal email servers for employee communication  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **File servers used exclusively by internal employees** – These belong on the internal LAN, not exposed to public networks.
- ❌ **Database servers containing sensitive information** – Should remain behind internal firewalls; exposing them would be a major security risk.
- ❌ **Internal email servers** – Like file servers, these serve internal users and should not be in a perimeter network.

# QUESTION 3

What is the role of the screening firewall in a screened subnet?

❌ To connect directly to the LAN  
❌ To provide unrestricted access to the Internet  
✅ To restrict traffic on the external/public interface  
❌ To filter communications between hosts in the perimeter and the LAN  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To connect directly to the LAN** – That’s the role of the **choke firewall**, not the screening firewall.
- ❌ **To provide unrestricted access to the Internet** – A screening firewall **limits** public access, not opens it.
- ❌ **To filter communications between hosts in the perimeter and the LAN** – Again, that’s the **choke firewall’s job**.

# QUESTION 4

Which IDS traffic assessment indicates that the system identified harmless traffic as offensive and generated an alarm or stopped the traffic?

❌ Negative  
❌ Positive  
❌ False negative  
✅ False positive  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Negative** – This isn’t a valid term in IDS classification. It's too vague.
- ❌ **Positive** – Same issue; not specific enough to describe accurate vs. inaccurate alerts.
- ❌ **False negative** – This means **malicious traffic was missed** (no alert triggered), which is the **opposite** of what's being asked.

# QUESTION 5

Which of the following network security zones is subject to strict hardening and configuration management policies, and where hosts, user accounts, and traffic are continually monitored to ensure compliance with security policies?

✅ Private server administrative networks  
❌ Public server network  
❌ Guest  
❌ Private client network  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Public server network** – These are exposed to the internet and not typically locked down for admin access; they’re **hardened**, but not **continuously monitored** like admin zones.
- ❌ **Guest** – The least trusted zone. It’s often isolated, with very **limited access**, but not subject to deep internal compliance monitoring.
- ❌ **Private client network** – Regular internal users. Important, yes, but **not treated with the same level of scrutiny** or policy enforcement as admin zones.

# QUESTION 6

What is the purpose of a choke point in a screened subnet configuration?

❌ To eliminate the need for internal firewalls  
❌ To provide a direct connection to the Internet  
✅ To facilitate better access control and easier monitoring  
❌ To allow unrestricted access between the perimeter network and the LAN  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To eliminate the need for internal firewalls** – Nope. A choke point helps *complement* firewalls, not replace them. Internal segmentation still matters.
- ❌ **To provide a direct connection to the Internet** – That’s exactly what we *don’t* want. A choke point **filters and inspects** traffic before it gets in or out.
- ❌ **To allow unrestricted access between the perimeter network and the LAN** – ❌ This would destroy security. A choke point does the opposite: it **restricts and screens**.

# QUESTION 7

What is the role of VLANs in network segmentation?

❌ To provide wireless connectivity  
❌ To enforce security policies at the application layer  
✅ To create separate broadcast domains  
❌ To increase the physical security of network devices  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To provide wireless connectivity** – VLANs work at Layer 2 (Data Link), not radio frequencies or SSID configurations. They’re used in both wired and wireless networks but don’t *provide* wireless access.
- ❌ **To enforce security policies at the application layer** – That's Layer 7 territory. VLANs are down at Layer 2, slicing up broadcast domains, not parsing HTTP requests.
- ❌ **To increase the physical security of network devices** – VLANs are logical segmentations. They don’t touch hardware locks, cages, or biometrics.

# QUESTION 8

Which of the following best describes the role of a sniffer in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?

❌ It serves as a firewall to block malicious traffic.  
❌ It generates signature patterns for detecting malicious activity.  
❌ It encrypts network traffic to prevent unauthorized access.  
✅ It reads frames from a mirrored port to monitor network traffic.  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **It serves as a firewall to block malicious traffic** – That’s IPS territory. IDS is passive; it detects, not defends in real-time.
- ❌ **It generates signature patterns for detecting malicious activity** – Snort or Suricata’s engine does that. A sniffer is just the set of eyes, not the brain.
- ❌ **It encrypts network traffic to prevent unauthorized access** – That's what TLS or IPSec handles. A sniffer listens; it doesn’t encrypt.

---
# QUESTION 9

What is a perimeter network also known as?

❌ A triple homed network  
❌ A fully public network  
✅ A demilitarized zone (DMZ)  
❌ A neutral zone  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **A triple homed network** – That’s a type of router/firewall config with three interfaces, but it’s not a synonym for the perimeter network.
- ❌ **A fully public network** – Perimeter networks *face* the public, but they’re not completely public. They’re controlled battlegrounds, not open fields.
- ❌ **A neutral zone** – Sounds poetic, but it’s not a technical term. The DMZ isn't neutral—it’s *strategically exposed*.

---
# QUESTION 10

Which security device is typically used to enforce rules between network zones?

❌ Access Point  
❌ Switch  
✅ Firewall  
❌ Router  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Access Point** – That's your Wi-Fi gateway, not a security enforcement point. It connects devices, doesn’t filter traffic by rules.
- ❌ **Switch** – Switches forward traffic based on MAC addresses within a LAN. No concept of zone-based rule enforcement.
- ❌ **Router** – Routers *route*, but don’t inherently enforce detailed security rules unless paired with firewall capabilities.  

✅ **Firewall** is the gatekeeper: it enforces traffic rules between zones like LAN, WAN, and DMZ, based on source, destination, port, and protocol.
