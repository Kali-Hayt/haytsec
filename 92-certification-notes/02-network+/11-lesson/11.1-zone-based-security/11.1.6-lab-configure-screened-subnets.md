## 🧪 Lab 11.1.6 – Configure Screened Subnets

### 🎯 Objective

Design a **screened subnet topology** by:
- Connecting routers and firewalls between the corporate LAN and the Internet
- Placing web and email servers into the screened subnet (DMZ)
- Using a switch to represent multiple public-facing systems

---

### 🧱 Network Design Overview

- **Corp_Router** connects internal LAN to the first firewall (choke firewall)
- **Choke Firewall** connects to the **Screening Firewall**
- **Screening Firewall** connects to the **InternetRouter**
- **Screened_Subnet_Switch** bridges the DMZ servers (Web + Email) to the Screening Firewall

> 📦 This creates a **buffer zone** between LAN and the wild Internet — a classic **screened subnet model**.

---

### ✅ Required Actions

#### 1. Connect Routers and Firewalls
- Tools Tray → `Routers`
- Place: `Corp_Router` → `Choke_Firewall` → `Screening_Firewall` → `InternetRouter`
- Use `Create Link` for connections (ensure ports are open and connected in order)

#### 2. Add Servers to Screened Subnet
- Tools Tray → `Switches`
- Place: `Screened_Subnet_Switch`
- Connect it to `Screening_Firewall`
- Tools Tray → `End Devices`
- Place: `Web_Server` and `Email_Server`
- Connect both to `Screened_Subnet_Switch` via `Ethernet`

---

### 🧠 Concept Recap

- **Choke Firewall** = protects internal resources
- **Screening Firewall** = filters external traffic into DMZ
- **Screened Subnet Switch** = provides connection point for public services

> 🧰 This lab simulates a production-grade **DMZ with double firewall architecture**, enforcing **least privilege** and **layered defense**.
