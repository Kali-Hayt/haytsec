# QUESTION 1

How is a user's biometric data used in a biometric lock system?

❌ It is deleted immediately after each use for privacy reasons.  
❌ It is sent to a remote server for storage.  
✅ It is recorded and stored on an authentication server.  
❌ It is stored on the user's badge.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Deleted after use**: Biometric systems need to compare future scans to a **stored template**—so deletion would defeat the purpose.
- ❌ **Sent to a remote server**: While possible in cloud-based setups, this is not standard for most physical security systems due to **latency and privacy risks**.
- ❌ **Stored on badge**: Badges typically store **ID numbers or certificates**, not **biometric templates**, which require secure, centralized processing.

# QUESTION 2

What is a badge reader used for in building security?

❌ To record the time employees leave the building  
❌ To provide lighting at entry points  
✅ To authenticate users quickly at access points  
❌ To detect motion at entry points

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Record time leaving**: While some systems log timestamps, the **primary purpose** of badge readers is **authentication**, not time tracking.
- ❌ **Provide lighting**: Lighting is handled by **motion sensors** or **manual controls**, not badge readers.
- ❌ **Detect motion**: That’s the job of **motion detectors** or **infrared sensors**, not authentication hardware.

# QUESTION 3

Due to an increase in foot traffic from outside groups throughout the building, the organization asks their security office to employ equipment that will allow visual monitoring across the organization.

What equipment would best be suited to manage this request?

❌ Circuit  
✅ Cameras  
❌ Motion Detection  
❌ Asset Tag

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Circuit**: Refers to electrical pathways—completely unrelated to **visual monitoring**.
- ❌ **Motion Detection**: Detects **presence or movement**, but does **not provide visual** footage.
- ❌ **Asset Tag**: Tracks **equipment**, not people—and definitely not **foot traffic** or visual activity.

# QUESTION 4

What feature allows a security camera to survey a large room and pick out individual faces?

✅ Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) controls  
❌ Narrow focal length  
❌ Fixed positioning  
❌ Coaxial cabling

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Narrow focal length**: Great for focused, close-range views—**not suited** for covering wide areas or adjusting angles.
- ❌ **Fixed positioning**: Stationary cameras can’t move, so they **can’t scan a large room** or track subjects.
- ❌ **Coaxial cabling**: That’s just the **physical connection** type—has nothing to do with camera capability or facial visibility.

# QUESTION 5

What can an organization use geofencing for?

✅ To control the use of camera functions on devices  
❌ To improve the accuracy of their GPS systems  
❌ To monitor the productivity of their employees  
❌ To increase the speed of their internet connection

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Improve GPS accuracy**: Geofencing **uses** location data; it doesn’t **enhance** the underlying GPS accuracy.
- ❌ **Monitor productivity**: That’s more aligned with **employee monitoring software**, not geolocation-based boundaries.
- ❌ **Increase internet speed**: Geofencing has **zero effect** on network performance—completely unrelated.
