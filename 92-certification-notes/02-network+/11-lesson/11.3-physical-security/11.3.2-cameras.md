## 11.3.2 – Cameras

### 🛡️ Purpose of Surveillance Cameras
- **Detection-based controls** enhance security when preventive controls fail.
- Surveillance = additional layer of defense at **perimeter gateways** or **internal zones**.
- Can be **manual** (guards) or **video-based** (CCTV/IP).
- Video surveillance is **more cost-effective** than assigning human guards everywhere.

### 📷 Types of Cameras
- **Fixed camera**: narrow focus, ideal for doorways or access points.
- **PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom)**: can move and zoom, ideal for large spaces and identifying faces.

### 📡 Connectivity & Infrastructure
- **Traditional CCTV**:
  - Uses **coaxial cables** to connect to a **multiplexer**.
  - Multiplexer:
    - Displays footage on screens.
    - Allows operator control of cameras.
    - Records to **tape or hard drive**.
- **Modern IP-based systems**:
  - Use **regular data cabling**.
  - **PoE (Power over Ethernet)**: simplifies setup—no separate power needed.
