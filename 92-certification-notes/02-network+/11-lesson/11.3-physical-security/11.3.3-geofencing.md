## 11.3.3 ‚Äì Geofencing

### üó∫Ô∏è Geolocation Basics
Geolocation identifies a device's **physical position** using location services:

- **üì° GPS (Global Positioning System)**  
  Determines latitude/longitude via **satellite signals** received by a GPS sensor.

- **üì∂ IPS (Indoor Positioning System)**  
  Estimates location by triangulating proximity to **radio sources**:
  - Cell towers
  - Wi-Fi access points
  - Bluetooth or RFID beacons

### üß± What is Geofencing?
- Geofencing = creating a **virtual boundary** around a physical location.
- Useful for:
  - Limiting or disabling camera/video usage
  - Triggering **context-aware authentication**
  - Enforcing location-based security policies

### üè¢ Example: Office Use Case
- Organization sets a geofence around its premises.
- Devices crossing this boundary may:
  - Have **camera/mic disabled**
  - Require **re-authentication**
  - Be **locked** until re-entering the zone

‚û°Ô∏è Enforcement is done via **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** software, relying on location data.
