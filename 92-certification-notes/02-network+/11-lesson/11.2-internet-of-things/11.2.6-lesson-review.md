# QUESTION 1  
What is a vulnerability in integrating ICS/SCADA systems with corporate data networks?

✅ Vulnerable links that can be exploited  
❌ Improved system interoperability  
❌ Enhanced data flow and efficiency  
❌ Increased system redundancy  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Improved system interoperability** – This is a *benefit*, not a vulnerability. It refers to better communication between systems, not an attack surface.  
- ❌ **Enhanced data flow and efficiency** – Again, that’s a *positive*. Attackers don’t fear efficiency — they exploit it.  
- ❌ **Increased system redundancy** – Redundancy *reduces* risk, not increases it. This would help *prevent* failure, not introduce a new vulnerability.  

🧱 ICS/SCADA systems often weren’t designed with security in mind. Hooking them into modern networks can expose attack paths.

# QUESTION 2  
What role does a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) play in an ICS?

✅ It controls industrial machinery and processes.  
❌ It serves as a data storage unit for industrial information.  
❌ It provides internet access to industrial devices.  
❌ It acts as a firewall for industrial devices.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **It serves as a data storage unit** – That’s more the job of a historian or SCADA server, not a PLC.  
- ❌ **It provides internet access** – A PLC doesn't deal with internet connectivity. In fact, exposing PLCs to the internet is a serious security risk.  
- ❌ **It acts as a firewall** – PLCs don’t provide perimeter defense. That’s what industrial firewalls or data diodes are for.  

🧱 Think of the PLC as the “muscle memory” of an ICS — it executes programmed instructions to directly operate motors, valves, pumps, etc.

# QUESTION 3  
Which of the following is a potential vulnerability of integrated peripherals in smart devices?

✅ Facilitation of surveillance  
❌ Increased battery life  
❌ Enhanced user experience  
❌ Improved device performance  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Increased battery life** – That's a benefit, not a vulnerability.  
- ❌ **Enhanced user experience** – Also a positive, not a risk.  
- ❌ **Improved device performance** – Again, this is an upside, not a security concern.  

🔍 **Facilitation of surveillance** is the correct answer because integrated peripherals (like microphones, cameras, GPS) can be hijacked or misused for covert monitoring. Think smart TVs listening in, or compromised webcams streaming silently.

# QUESTION 4  
What distinguishes smart building technology from consumer-grade IoT devices in terms of security?

✅ Smart building technology has less scope for compromise  
❌ Smart building technology cannot be updated  
❌ Smart building technology uses Bluetooth exclusively  
❌ Smart building technology is more prone to compromise  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Cannot be updated** – Smart building systems **can** be updated, especially enterprise-grade ones with centralized control and patch management.  
- ❌ **Bluetooth exclusively** – False. Smart building tech can use Zigbee, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and other protocols, not just Bluetooth.  
- ❌ **More prone to compromise** – Actually the opposite. These systems are designed with security and segmentation in mind, unlike many consumer devices.

🧱 **Smart building systems** are hardened environments with access control, centralized monitoring, and stricter design requirements. That gives them **less attack surface**, not more.

# QUESTION 5  
What makes smart devices vulnerable to standard attacks?

✅ Their compute, storage, and network functions  
❌ Their inability to connect to the Internet  
❌ The use of proprietary operating systems  
❌ The lack of integrated peripherals  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Inability to connect to the Internet** – Actually, smart devices *do* connect, and that’s part of the risk.  
- ❌ **Proprietary operating systems** – While they can have flaws, proprietary systems don’t inherently make a device vulnerable to *standard* attacks.  
- ❌ **Lack of integrated peripherals** – Not relevant. It's the *presence*, not absence, of capabilities that opens more attack surfaces.

🧱 Smart devices combine **compute + storage + networking** — making them miniature computers. If they're poorly secured (which they often are), they’re wide open to familiar attack vectors: brute-force, buffer overflows, default creds, etc.

# QUESTION 6  
What is a significant advantage of Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) over regular cellular connectivity?

✅ Greater penetrating power  
❌ Unlimited bandwidth usage  
❌ Higher data rates  
❌ Direct connection to the Internet without intermediaries  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Unlimited bandwidth usage** – NB-IoT is optimized for **low-bandwidth**, not unlimited or high bandwidth.  
- ❌ **Higher data rates** – It’s the opposite: NB-IoT trades speed for **efficiency and range**.  
- ❌ **Direct connection without intermediaries** – NB-IoT still uses carriers and network infrastructure.  

🧱 **NB-IoT** is made for **low-power**, **long-range** comms — think underground sensors or devices deep inside buildings.  
🔍 “Greater penetrating power” means the signal can go through walls, concrete, even basements better than traditional LTE.

# QUESTION 7  
What distinguishes an Operational Technology (OT) network from a standard IT data network?

✅ OT networks are optimized for real-time transfers.  
❌ OT networks are primarily used for gaming.  
❌ OT networks use standard Ethernet only.  
❌ OT networks cannot use industrial Ethernet.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Primarily used for gaming** – That’s absurd. OT is for industrial control systems, not Fortnite.  
- ❌ **Standard Ethernet only** – OT networks often use **specialized protocols** (e.g., Modbus, Profibus) and **industrial Ethernet**, not just standard.  
- ❌ **Cannot use industrial Ethernet** – They often *do* use it; that’s the point in many industrial setups.  

🧱 **OT networks** are built to support **deterministic, time-sensitive** communication — think **PLC timing, machine control**, and **safety systems**, where delays can be catastrophic.

# QUESTION 8  
What is a "data historian" in the context of an ICS?

✅ A database generated by the control loop  
❌ A communication protocol for PLCs  
❌ A backup server for industrial data  
❌ A cybersecurity tool for industrial networks  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Communication protocol for PLCs** – That’s something like Modbus or OPC, not a historian.  
- ❌ **Backup server** – A data historian stores continuous **time-series data**, not just backups.  
- ❌ **Cybersecurity tool** – It’s for storing *data*, not defending it. Think more **archive**, less **firewall**.

🧱 Think of a **data historian** as the **black box** in industrial control: it logs sensor values, equipment status, temperatures, and other control loop metrics over time for analysis, optimization, and audit.

# QUESTION 9  
What characterizes a static computing environment?

✅ Limited support for correcting security issues  
❌ High levels of user customization and data file management  
❌ Frequent hardware and software changes  
❌ The ability to install new operating systems  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **User customization** – Static environments are the opposite of customizable; they’re locked-down.  
- ❌ **Frequent changes** – “Static” means minimal or no changes, often for stability or legacy reasons.  
- ❌ **Installing OSs** – That’s a *dynamic* environment trait; static systems resist change to avoid breaking functionality.

🧱 Think of static environments like **legacy ICS/SCADA systems**: hard to patch, hard to upgrade, and often left exposed with minimal updates. Stable, but brittle.

# QUESTION 10  
What can mitigate the risks posed by IoT devices in remote working scenarios?

✅ Regular audits and employee security awareness training  
❌ Using older, more familiar technology  
❌ Avoiding the use of Wi-Fi networks  
❌ Decreasing the number of devices connected to the home network  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Older tech** – Familiarity doesn't equal security. Older tech is often more vulnerable due to lack of patches.  
- ❌ **Avoiding Wi-Fi** – Unrealistic and impractical for remote work. Focus should be on securing Wi-Fi (WPA3, strong passwords, etc.), not avoiding it.  
- ❌ **Fewer devices** – Reducing devices doesn't address the **real risk**: lack of security controls and poor user behavior. A single insecure device is enough to breach a network.

🛡️ **Training and audits** build a security-aware culture and ensure weaknesses are caught before attackers exploit them.
