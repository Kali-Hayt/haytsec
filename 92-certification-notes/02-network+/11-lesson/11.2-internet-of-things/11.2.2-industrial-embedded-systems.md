## 11.2.2 Industrial Embedded Systems

### üß± Industrial Embedded Systems & IIoT

- Embedded systems are widely used in **industrial sectors**:
  - Energy generation/distribution
  - Mining and raw material refining
  - Manufacturing and fabrication
  - Logistics and delivery systems

- **Industrial IoT (IIoT)** differs from consumer IoT:
  - Priorities shift to **safety, availability, and integrity**
  - **AIC > CIA**: Availability > Integrity > Confidentiality
  - Hazards: Involvement of **electromechanical components** makes reliability critical

üß† **Analogy**: While IT protects secrets (CIA), IIoT protects lives and machines (AIC).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow and Process Automation Systems

- **Industrial Control System (ICS)**:
  - Controls machinery in **critical infrastructure**:
    - Power, water, healthcare, telecom, national security
  - When localized to one site ‚Üí called a **Distributed Control System (DCS)**

- ICS includes:
  - **PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)**:
    - Connect to actuators: valves, motors, circuit breakers
    - Monitor states via sensors: temperature, pressure, etc.
  - **HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces)**:
    - Local control panels or PC-based software
    - Allow human operators to configure PLCs
  - **Control Server**: Oversees full system operation
  - **Data Historian**:
    - Specialized DB storing all control loop information for analysis/auditing

### üì° Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

- **SCADA** replaces the control server in **large-scale, multi-site ICS**.
- Typically runs on **ordinary computers**:
  - Gathers and manages data from **field devices** (PLCs)
- Uses **WAN technologies** (e.g., cellular, fiber) to connect remote locations

üß† **Analogy**: If ICS is the brain of a single factory, SCADA is the nervous system connecting multiple factories across a nation.
