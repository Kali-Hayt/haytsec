## 11.2.3 IoT Networks

### üß± IoT Device Identification & Networking

- Every IoT device has a **unique ID** embedded in its OS or control system.
- Devices can:
  - Connect directly to the Internet, or
  - Use an intermediary (hub, gateway)
- Challenge: Standard networks (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular) may be:
  - Too **power-hungry**
  - Unsuitable for small/unpowered devices
- Specialized networking standards are used to support IoT needs.

### üèó Operational Technology (OT) Networks

- **OT networks** = Cabled networks for industrial environments.
- Used to **distinguish from IT networks**:
  - Real-time, deterministic data transfers
  - **Industrial Ethernet** or **serial data protocols** used
- Often includes:
  - Vendor-specific protocols
  - Specialized application protocols

üß† **Analogy**: OT networks are like factory-specific highways‚Äîbuilt for speed, timing, and specialized traffic, not for public use like IT networks.

### üì° Cellular Networks for IoT

Cellular IoT = Long-distance communication using **baseband radio** (same system used by phones).

**Two types of cellular radio used for IoT:**

- **Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT)**:
  - Low-power version of LTE/4G
  - Limited bandwidth: **20‚Äì100 kbps**
  - Excellent for:
    - Low-latency sensor data
    - Deep signal penetration (tunnels, basements)
  - Low energy use

- **LTE-M (LTE Machine Type Communication)**:
  - Also low power
  - Supports **higher speeds** (~1 Mbps)
  - Suited for devices needing more frequent or heavier communication

üß† **Analogy**: NB-IoT = whisper through walls, LTE-M = low voice across a room. Both are quiet, but one carries more info.
