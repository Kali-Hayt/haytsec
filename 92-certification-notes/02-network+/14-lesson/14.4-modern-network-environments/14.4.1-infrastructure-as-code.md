## 14.4.1 – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **IaC Definition**: Automating infrastructure management where code replaces manual configuration entirely.
- **Goal**: Eliminate "snowflake systems" (unique, inconsistent setups) to avoid drift and instability.
- **Drift Risk**: Configuration differences can lead to security/stability issues (e.g., missed patches).
- **Immutable Architecture**: Instances aren’t updated in place—replace with new instances instead.
- **Idempotence**: Same input always gives the same result; prevents unpredictable behavior.
- **Caution**: IaC isn’t just random scripts—it needs tested, consistent playbooks to avoid drift.

## Automation & Playbooks

- **Manual vs. Automated**: Automation executes standard tasks via scripts/playbooks to reduce error and enforce compliance.
- **Goal**: Automate as many SOP steps as possible while keeping key human verification points.
- **Tool Types**:
  - **Imperative**: Specify exact steps to reach desired state.
  - **Declarative**: Specify desired end state, let the system decide how to achieve it.

## Orchestration

- **Definition**: Sequences multiple automated tasks into an end-to-end workflow.
- **Example**: Add VM → configure app/network → join load balancer → adjust distribution.
- **Requirements**: Correct sequence, right credentials, and necessary permissions.
- **Purpose**: Handle complex, multi-step processes without manual intervention.
- **Advantages**:
  - Works across multiple cloud platforms.
  - Reduces vendor lock-in—portable workflows.
- **Popular Tools**: Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Kubernetes.
