## SASE, SSE, CASB, and SWG — Summary

### SASE (Secure Access Service Edge)
- **Purpose**: Combines **SD-WAN** (secure tunnels for remote access) with **SSE** (Security Service Edge).
- **How it Works**:  
  - User’s SD-WAN connection doesn’t go directly to the cloud service.  
  - It first goes through an **SSE** service, which applies security controls.

---

## SSE (Security Service Edge)
- **Definition**: A set of cloud-based technologies that **mediate access** to cloud services and web apps.
- **Examples**:  
  - **Zero Trust Architecture**
  - **CASB** (Cloud Access Security Broker)
  - **SWG** (Secure Web Gateway)

---

## CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker)
- **Role**: Security checkpoint between enterprise users and cloud services.
- **Functions**:
  - Enforce **SSO** and access controls.
  - Scan for **malware** and block noncompliant devices.
  - Monitor and audit **user/resource activity**.
  - Prevent **data exfiltration** by blocking unsanctioned cloud apps.

### CASB Deployment Models
1. **Forward Proxy**  
   - Placed at **client network edge**.  
   - Inspects all traffic in real-time.  
   - **Pros**: Full traffic inspection.  
   - **Cons**: Possible to bypass; performance bottlenecks; single point of failure.
2. **Reverse Proxy**  
   - Placed at **cloud network edge**.  
   - No device configuration needed.  
   - Only works if app supports proxy integration.
3. **API-Based**  
   - Uses APIs to manage access **without being inline**.  
   - Example: Disabled local account triggers cloud account lock via API.  
   - **Note**: Depends on API capability.  
   - Often combined with proxy methods.

---

## SWG (Secure Web Gateway)
- **Role**: Mediates user access to **Internet sites/services**.
- **On-Premises SWG**:  
  - Acts as a **proxy firewall** + **content filter** + **IDS/IPS**.
  - Applies policy before allowing internet traffic.

---

### Big Picture
- **SASE** = SD-WAN + SSE.
- **SSE** includes **Zero Trust**, **CASB**, and **SWG**.
- **CASB** = Cloud access security enforcer (proxy/API-based).
- **SWG** = Internet access security enforcer.
