## Zero Trust Security Model — Summary

### Core Principle
- **Never trust, always verify** — all devices, users, and services must be authenticated and authorized before accessing network resources, whether inside or outside the network perimeter.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Policy-Based Authentication**  
  - Identity verification is continuous, dynamic, and context-aware.
  - Decisions consider user context and the resource being accessed.

- **Threat Scope Reduction & Least Privilege Access**  
  - Access granted only on a need-to-know basis.
  - Limits attack surface and potential damage.

- **Policy-Driven Authorization**  
  - Permissions enforced based on user identity, device security posture, and network context.

## Control Plane vs. Data Plane

### Control Plane
- **Purpose**: Defines policies, makes access decisions.
- **Policy Decision Point** (centralized):
  - **Policy Engine**:  
    - Holds identities, credentials, policies, threat intelligence, and behavioral analytics.  
    - Uses this data to make dynamic per-request decisions.
  - **Policy Administrator**:  
    - Issues access tokens, establishes or tears down sessions.  
    - Interfaces with the data plane.
- **Focus**: Least privilege enforcement, activity monitoring, adapting to new threats.

### Data Plane
- **Purpose**: Executes secure information transfers.
- **Process**:
  - Subject (user/service) requests a resource.
  - **Policy Enforcement Point** (PEP):  
    - Mediates requests based on policy administrator’s decisions.  
    - Only authorized processes can communicate with the policy administrator.
  - If approved, creates a secure data pathway; if denied, session is terminated.
- **Security**: Root of trust ensures decisions can’t be tampered with.

---

## Implicit Trust Zone
- Secure data path between PEP and resource (e.g., IPSec tunnel with signed agents).
- Prevents tampering even if network infrastructure is compromised.
- **Design Goal**: Keep trust zones **small** and **short-lived** (microsegmentation).
  - Sessions may be per-transaction.
  - Behavioral analytics can revoke access at any time.

---

## Contrast with Perimeter-Based Model
- **Perimeter-Based**: Trust is granted after initial authentication into the network.
- **Zero Trust**: Location in network doesn’t imply trust; trust is continuously evaluated.
