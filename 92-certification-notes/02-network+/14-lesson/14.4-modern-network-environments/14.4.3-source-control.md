## 14.4.3 – Source Control

- **Source Control** = Process of managing code for a software project.
  - Ensures correct script version is used to avoid config drift & noncompliance.
  - Important in collaborative environments — requires procedures & tools so multiple developers can work together.

- **Version Control**  
  - ID system for each iteration of a product/script.
  - Tracks both public version numbers (customer-facing) and internal build numbers.
  - Supports change management in software projects.

- **Central Repository**  
  - Repository server maintains source code (e.g., Git).
  - Developer commits → New version tagged, old version archived.
  - Allows rollback if problems occur.

- **Branching**  
  - Create branch copies for new features/changes.
  - Branch code tested/validated before merging into main branch.

- **Conflict Identification**  
  - Even with branching, code changes can clash.
  - Conflict identification tools help detect and resolve these issues.
