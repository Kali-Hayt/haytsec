## 14.1.3 Storage Area Networks (SANs)

### Overview
Most data centers require shared access to large amounts of storage.  
- ðŸ’¾ **Direct-Attached Storage (DAS)**: Storage device inside the server, used mainly for OS and software images.  
- ðŸ—„ **Storage Area Network (SAN)**: Dedicated, high-speed network that connects servers to shared storage devices using block I/O.

â›´ **Ship Analogy**:  
Think of the SAN as a **secure cargo hold deep inside the ship**, only accessible to authorized crew (servers). Crew members donâ€™t carry their own cargo everywhere â€” instead, they store it in this central hold for quick, reliable access.

### How a SAN Works
- ðŸ“¦ Each read/write addresses the exact location of data (like DAS), but over a **dedicated storage network**.  
- ðŸš€ Requires extremely **fast and reliable connections** â€” isolated from the main network to avoid congestion.  
- ðŸ”’ Only accessed by servers, not by client PCs or laptops.  
- ðŸ–¥ SAN clients are servers running databases or applications needing large shared storage.

---

### Capabilities
- ðŸ§© Can integrate various storage tech:  
  - RAID arrays  
  - Tape libraries  
- âš– Supports **tiered storage**: mix of high-speed and low-cost devices to match file access needs.  
- ðŸ’¡ Reduces need to overprovision expensive, fast drives.

### Analogy Recap
- ðŸ’¾ DAS = A crew memberâ€™s personal locker.  
- ðŸ—„ SAN = The shipâ€™s main secure cargo hold, optimized for efficiency, speed, and reliability.
