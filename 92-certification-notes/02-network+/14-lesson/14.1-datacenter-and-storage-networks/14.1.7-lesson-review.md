# QUESTION 1
How does a SAN provision access to storage devices?

❌ Through application-level protocols  
❌ Through file-level input/output  
❌ Via direct physical connections  
✅ Using block input/output  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Through application-level protocols** – Application-level protocols operate at a much higher layer and don’t directly control storage device access in a SAN.
- ❌ **Through file-level input/output** – File-level I/O is used by NAS systems, not SANs. SANs work at the block level for faster, more flexible access.
- ❌ **Via direct physical connections** – While cables and interfaces are involved, SANs abstract storage access over the network; it’s not just raw physical connection without a protocol.

# QUESTION 2
What is NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF)?

❌ A Fibre Channel switch feature  
❌ A storage device interface  
❌ A type of Ethernet switch  
✅ Using NVMe in a networked environment  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A Fibre Channel switch feature** – NVMe-oF is not limited to Fibre Channel; it works over multiple transport types, including Ethernet and InfiniBand.
- ❌ **A storage device interface** – NVMe itself is a storage interface, but NVMe-oF refers to extending NVMe access across a network.
- ❌ **A type of Ethernet switch** – It’s a protocol/technology, not a physical switch device.

# QUESTION 3
Why should a SAN not be implemented on the same cabling as a production data network?

❌ To simplify network management  
✅ To avoid performance impacts  
❌ To increase data rates  
❌ To reduce costs  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To simplify network management** – Using the same cabling actually complicates troubleshooting and management due to mixed traffic types.
- ❌ **To increase data rates** – Data rates depend on hardware and configuration, not whether SAN and production share cables.
- ❌ **To reduce costs** – Sharing cabling might save initial costs but leads to performance degradation and potential downtime costs.

# QUESTION 4
Who are the clients of a SAN?

❌ Client PCs and laptops  
❌ External storage vendors  
❌ Internet users accessing cloud services  
✅ Servers running databases or applications  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Client PCs and laptops** – These typically access storage through file shares or applications, not directly over a SAN.
- ❌ **External storage vendors** – They provide storage solutions, but they are not the SAN clients.
- ❌ **Internet users accessing cloud services** – They interact with front-end applications; the back-end servers handle SAN access.

# QUESTION 5
What is the role of virtualized security appliances in modern data centers?

✅ To monitor traffic as it passes between servers  
❌ To store physical documents securely  
❌ To manage employee workspaces  
❌ To replace physical servers  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To store physical documents securely** – This refers to physical document storage solutions, not network traffic monitoring.
- ❌ **To manage employee workspaces** – Workspace management is handled by endpoint or VDI solutions, not security appliances.
- ❌ **To replace physical servers** – Virtualized security appliances supplement security, they don’t replace server hardware.

# QUESTION 6
In a spine and leaf topology, how are spine switches connected?

❌ Through a central hub  
❌ Via the Internet  
❌ Directly to one another  
✅ Not directly connected  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Through a central hub** – Spine switches themselves act as part of the backbone; there is no separate hub device.
- ❌ **Via the Internet** – Spine-leaf is an internal data center topology, not something routed over the public Internet.
- ❌ **Directly to one another** – In spine-leaf, each spine connects to all leaf switches, but not to other spines.

# QUESTION 7
What has changed the nature of data center traffic flows?

❌ The reduction in server costs  
❌ The increase in physical document storage  
❌ The decrease in internet usage  
✅ The design of modern applications as services  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The reduction in server costs** – While server prices influence purchasing, they don’t directly dictate traffic patterns.
- ❌ **The increase in physical document storage** – Physical storage has no impact on digital data flow within data centers.
- ❌ **The decrease in internet usage** – Internet usage is increasing, not decreasing, and internal data center traffic patterns are influenced more by application architecture.
---
# QUESTION 8
What kind of traffic is referred to as north–south in a data center?

❌ Traffic for internal email communication  
❌ Traffic exclusively within the server management team  
✅ Traffic that represents clients outside the data center  
❌ Traffic between servers within the data center  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Traffic for internal email communication** – Email between internal users may not cross the north–south path; it’s often east–west if internal.
- ❌ **Traffic exclusively within the server management team** – This is internal communication and would generally be east–west.
- ❌ **Traffic between servers within the data center** – That’s east–west traffic, not north–south.
---
# QUESTION 9
What is a key benefit of the spine and leaf topology regarding network loops?

✅ It is inherently loop-free.  
❌ Loops are considered beneficial for redundancy.  
❌ Loops are managed through manual configuration.  
❌ It requires spanning tree to prevent loops.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Loops are considered beneficial for redundancy** – While redundancy is important, uncontrolled loops cause broadcast storms and network issues.
- ❌ **Loops are managed through manual configuration** – Spine–leaf is designed so loops don’t exist in the first place, avoiding the need for manual loop management.
- ❌ **It requires spanning tree to prevent loops** – Spine–leaf topology doesn’t rely on spanning tree because its design inherently avoids loops.

# QUESTION 10
Which of the following is NOT a typical device acting as a target in a Fibre Channel SAN?

✅ Network switches  
❌ RAID drive arrays  
❌ Tape drives  
❌ Single drives  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **RAID drive arrays** – Common SAN targets for high-capacity and fault-tolerant storage.
- ❌ **Tape drives** – Often used for SAN-based backups and archiving.
- ❌ **Single drives** – Can also be SAN targets, though less common in enterprise deployments compared to arrays.
