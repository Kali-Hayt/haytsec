# QUESTION 1
What is a primary use case for containers in cloud computing?

❌ To increase the need for manual configuration  
❌ To serve as physical network devices  
✅ To run a single application service or workload task  
❌ To run heavy desktop applications  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ To increase the need for manual configuration — Containers aim to reduce manual setup, not increase it.  
- ❌ To serve as physical network devices — Containers are virtualized application environments, not hardware devices.  
- ❌ To run heavy desktop applications — Containers are optimized for lightweight, isolated workloads, not resource-intensive desktop apps.

# QUESTION 2
What does a NAT gateway allow an instance to do?

❌ Assign a public IP address to every instance within a subnet.  
❌ Encrypt all outbound and inbound communications.  
✅ Connect out to the Internet without allowing inbound connections.  
❌ Monitor and log all Internet traffic.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ Assign a public IP address to every instance within a subnet — NAT gateways do not assign IPs; they translate private IPs to a public IP for outbound traffic.  
- ❌ Encrypt all outbound and inbound communications — Encryption is handled by protocols like TLS or IPsec, not NAT.  
- ❌ Monitor and log all Internet traffic — NAT gateways don’t provide logging by default; logging requires separate services like CloudWatch or VPC Flow Logs.

# QUESTION 3
What is required to enable communication between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that are isolated by default?

✅ Configuring routing  
❌ Merging the VPCs  
❌ Increasing bandwidth allocation  
❌ Disabling network isolation  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ Merging the VPCs — VPCs remain separate entities; communication is achieved via peering or routing, not merging.  
- ❌ Increasing bandwidth allocation — Bandwidth does not enable communication by itself; routing rules are needed.  
- ❌ Disabling network isolation — Isolation is by design; simply “disabling” it isn’t a supported or secure method.

# QUESTION 4
What is the role of Virtual Network Function (VNF) in NFV architecture?

❌ To enhance security protocols  
❌ To provide storage solutions  
❌ To manage physical network devices  
✅ To deploy instances of each virtual appliance  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ To enhance security protocols — Security may be a function of certain VNFs (like firewalls), but the core role is broader: deploying virtualized network appliances.  
- ❌ To provide storage solutions — Storage falls under other virtualization or cloud service components, not VNFs.  
- ❌ To manage physical network devices — NFV is about virtualizing network functions, not directly managing physical devices.

# QUESTION 5
What is the purpose of a transit gateway in cloud connectivity?

✅ To manage interconnections between VPCs and VPN gateways  
❌ To reduce the cost of cloud services  
❌ To increase the storage capacity of VPCs  
❌ To provide internet access to cloud services  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ To reduce the cost of cloud services — A transit gateway may optimize network design, but its purpose is not inherently cost reduction.  
- ❌ To increase the storage capacity of VPCs — Storage is unrelated to a transit gateway’s function.  
- ❌ To provide internet access to cloud services — That’s handled by internet gateways or NAT gateways, not transit gateways.

# QUESTION 6
What is the role of an Internet gateway in a subnet's Internet communications?

✅ It performs 1:1 network address translation (NAT).  
❌ It monitors traffic for security threats.  
❌ It assigns private IP addresses.  
❌ It encrypts data packets.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ It monitors traffic for security threats — That’s a firewall or IDS/IPS role, not an internet gateway function.  
- ❌ It assigns private IP addresses — IP address assignment is handled by DHCP or manual configuration, not the internet gateway.  
- ❌ It encrypts data packets — Encryption is handled by protocols like TLS, IPsec, or VPN solutions, not the gateway itself.

# QUESTION 7
What is the difference between an Internet gateway and a NAT gateway in terms of directionality?

✅ An Internet gateway is two-way, while a NAT gateway is one-way.  
❌ Both gateways are two-way.  
❌ An Internet gateway is one-way, while a NAT gateway is two-way.  
❌ Both gateways are one-way.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ Both gateways are two-way — NAT gateways only allow outbound connections and block unsolicited inbound connections, so they are not two-way.  
- ❌ An Internet gateway is one-way, while a NAT gateway is two-way — This reverses their actual behavior. Internet gateways allow both inbound and outbound traffic.  
- ❌ Both gateways are one-way — Internet gateways are bidirectional; only NAT gateways are outbound-only.

# QUESTION 8
What is the role of a direct connect link in cloud connectivity?

✅ To establish a connection to the cloud provider's data center  
❌ To provide a secure, encrypted connection over the Internet  
❌ To enable peer-to-peer file sharing between cloud instances  
❌ To connect individual cloud services within the same VPC  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ To provide a secure, encrypted connection over the Internet — Direct Connect is a private, dedicated line that bypasses the public Internet; it’s not inherently encrypted.  
- ❌ To enable peer-to-peer file sharing between cloud instances — That’s handled within VPC networking or peering, not by Direct Connect.  
- ❌ To connect individual cloud services within the same VPC — Internal VPC services are connected locally; Direct Connect is for linking to on-premises or external data centers.

# QUESTION 9
What can a cloud consumer assign within each Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)? (Select two.)

✅ An IPv6 CIDR block  
❌ An unlimited number of IPv6 CIDR blocks  
❌ A physical server to each subnet within the VPC  
❌ IPv4 CIDR blocks without any subnets  
✅ A single IPv4 CIDR block  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ An unlimited number of IPv6 CIDR blocks — Cloud providers impose limits; it’s never truly unlimited.  
- ❌ A physical server to each subnet within the VPC — VPCs are virtual; they map to instances, not direct physical hardware assignments.  
- ❌ IPv4 CIDR blocks without any subnets — IPv4 CIDR blocks must be split into subnets to function in a VPC.

# QUESTION 10
What is the benefit of segmentation in cloud firewall security?

✅ To enhance performance and compliance  
❌ To simplify network architecture  
❌ To eliminate the need for security rules  
❌ To reduce the need for firewalls  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ To simplify network architecture — Segmentation actually adds complexity, but in a controlled and secure way.  
- ❌ To eliminate the need for security rules — Segmentation still requires well-defined security rules; it doesn’t replace them.  
- ❌ To reduce the need for firewalls — Firewalls are still necessary; segmentation works with them, not instead of them.

# QUESTION 11
What property does a security group have regarding its filtering rules?

✅ Stateful  
❌ Stateless  
❌ Stateless with exceptions  
❌ Stateful with exceptions  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ Stateless — Security groups keep track of established connections, so they are not stateless.  
- ❌ Stateless with exceptions — This is not how AWS security groups operate; they are fully stateful by design.  
- ❌ Stateful with exceptions — Security groups don’t selectively apply statefulness; all rules are stateful.

# QUESTION 12
What is a major advantage of using a VPN-based method for cloud connectivity?

✅ It is cost-effective and straightforward to set up.  
❌ It offers unlimited bandwidth.  
❌ It eliminates latency completely.  
❌ It requires no internet connectivity.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ It offers unlimited bandwidth — VPNs are limited by network capacity and service provider constraints.  
- ❌ It eliminates latency completely — VPNs can actually add slight latency due to encryption overhead.  
- ❌ It requires no internet connectivity — VPNs typically operate over the internet unless on a dedicated private circuit.

# QUESTION 13
What is a unique feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) security lists?

✅ They apply to an entire subnet.  
❌ They require manual activation.  
❌ They can only be applied to one instance at a time.  
❌ They are stateless.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ They require manual activation — Security lists are applied automatically once associated with a subnet.  
- ❌ They can only be applied to one instance at a time — They are subnet-level, not instance-specific.  
- ❌ They are stateless — OCI security lists are stateful, tracking connection states for return traffic.

# QUESTION 14
What is the benefit of using virtual appliances in a cloud environment?

✅ They can emulate the functions of dedicated hardware appliances.  
❌ They eliminate the need for any network security.  
❌ They are only compatible with proprietary operating systems.  
❌ They require dedicated hardware.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ They eliminate the need for any network security — Network security is still essential, even with virtual appliances.  
- ❌ They are only compatible with proprietary operating systems — Virtual appliances often support multiple OS types.  
- ❌ They require dedicated hardware — The main point of virtual appliances is to avoid the need for physical hardware.

# QUESTION 15
Which type of firewall can store connection states and use rules to allow established or related traffic?

✅ Stateful packet filtering firewall  
❌ Network layer firewall  
❌ Web application firewall (WAF)  
❌ Application layer firewall  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ Network layer firewall — This term describes the OSI layer it operates on, not the ability to track states.  
- ❌ Web application firewall (WAF) — WAFs filter HTTP/S traffic but don’t maintain generic connection state.  
- ❌ Application layer firewall — Focuses on filtering specific application data, not on tracking connection states.
