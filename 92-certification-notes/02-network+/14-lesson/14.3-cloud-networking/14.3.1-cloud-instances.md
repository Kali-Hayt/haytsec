## 14.3.1 – Cloud Instances

- In IaaS or PaaS, workloads are created to deliver services to customers (e.g., streaming a video).
- Each workload needs:
  - **Compute** (CPU, RAM)
  - **Storage**
  - **Network resources**
- These are allocated using virtualization.

---

## Virtualization Types
- **Virtual Machine (VM)** – Instance of a computer or network appliance running an OS & software.  
  - Configurable CPUs, RAM, storage, and network links.
  - Managed via RDP or SSH.
- **Container** – Lightweight instance for one application or task.  
  - No emulated hardware, but still uses compute, storage, and network resources.

---

## Virtual Appliances
- VM running specialized software that replaces dedicated hardware appliances.
- Examples: virtual routers, firewalls, load balancers, IDS/IPS.
- Built using **Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)** standards.

---

## NFV Components
- **Virtual Network Function (VNF)** – Defines and deploys each virtual appliance; runs as a VM.
- **NFV Infrastructure** – Allocates compute, storage, and network to each VNF.
- **Management and Orchestration (MANO)** – Places VNFs into workflows and manages their tasks.

---

## ✅ Key Point
- NFV standardization = easier automation, orchestration, and scaling of network services.
