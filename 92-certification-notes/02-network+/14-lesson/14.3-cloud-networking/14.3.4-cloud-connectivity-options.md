## 14.3.4 â€“ Cloud Connectivity Options

- Cloud connectivity = how clients connect to cloud-hosted infrastructure, platforms, or software.
- Key scenarios:
  - Secure access for individual hosts/users.
  - Connecting on-premises networks to the cloud.
  - Linking cloud infrastructure in different geographic regions.
  - Building multicloud setups with multiple providers.

### ðŸ›³ Ship Analogy
- **VPN** = A private underwater tunnel from your ship to another dock â€” safe but can be slower.
- **Direct Connect/Colocation** = A permanent, high-speed shipping lane directly between two ports.
- **Transit Gateway** = A central harbor hub connecting many docks and routes together.

---

## Internet/Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- Configure VPN gateway in the VPC.
- Connection models:
  - **Client-to-site** â€“ Individual host connects securely to the cloud.
  - **Site-to-site** â€“ Links on-premises networks to the cloud or to other clouds.
- Pros:
  - Cost-effective and quick to set up.
  - Works anywhere with Internet access.
- Cons:
  - Public Internet = higher latency & possible bandwidth throttling.
  - Not ideal for mission-critical or high-volume workloads.

---

## Direct Connect / Colocation
- High-bandwidth private link between customer network and cloud providerâ€™s datacenter.
- Methods:
  - Infrastructure inside a provider-supported datacenter.
  - Direct connect link from enterprise network.
- Pros:
  - Low-latency, secure, reliable.
  - Ideal for centralized operations or HQ-to-branch access.

---

## Transit Gateways
- Connect VPCs within same or different accounts, or between VPCs and on-premises networks.
- Benefits:
  - Greater segmentation by using multiple VPCs.
  - Easier management than mesh-style VPC peering.
- Acts as a virtual router managing traffic between all connected networks.

## âœ… Key Point
- **VPN** = Flexible & secure, but slower over public Internet.
- **Direct Connect** = Fast & private, best for heavy/critical workloads.
- **Transit Gateway** = Centralized, scalable network interconnection.
