### 14.3.5 Cloud Firewall Security

- Cloud firewalls control traffic between subnets using security rules to allow or block connections.  
- Enforcement can be done by:
  - Cloud providerâ€™s built-in virtual firewall.
  - Virtual firewall instances or other security appliances.
- Firewalls apply to multiple accounts, VPCs, subnets, and instances, enabling network segmentation.
- Segmentation is used for:
  - Performance and load balancing.
  - Isolating workloads for compliance.
  - Separating data access for different departments or functions.

**Filtering layers (OSI model):**
- **Layer 3 â€“ Network:** Filters based on IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports (basic packet filtering).
- **Layer 4 â€“ Transport:** Maintains connection state tables to allow established/related traffic (higher CPU/memory usage).
- **Layer 7 â€“ Application:** Parses protocol headers and payloads (e.g., HTTP) for content-based filtering (highest processing demand).

**Implementation methods:**
- **Host-based (software):** Runs on an instance, similar to on-premises firewalls or WAFs; consumes instance resources and can be harder to manage at scale.
- **Virtualization layer service:** Filters traffic between VPC subnets and instances, acting like a traditional network firewall.

**Cost consideration:**  
- Default cloud application-aware firewalls may incur transaction costs based on deployment time and traffic volume â€” sometimes making third-party options more cost-effective.
