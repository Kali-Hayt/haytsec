## 13.1.2 ‚Äì Internet Access Types

### WAN Access Setup Basics
- To connect to a WAN provider, their cabling terminates at your premises.
- A **demarcation point (demarc)** or **minimum point of entry (MPOE)** marks where the provider‚Äôs responsibility ends and yours begins.
- Beyond this point, the customer is responsible for maintenance.
- **Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)** = Modems, routers, or other gear installed at the customer‚Äôs site.
  - Can be owned or leased.
  - Provider may or may not cover faults depending on contract.
- **Security & Standards**: Demarc and CPE should be in a secure, access-controlled area ‚Üí Known as **entrance facilities** per TIA/EIA cabling standards.

**Analogy**:  
The demarc is like the fence line between your yard and the utility company‚Äôs ‚Äî everything beyond the fence is *your* problem.

## Common Internet Access Types

### üß± T-Carrier
- Converts **voice traffic to digital** for transport across telecom networks.
- Also carries **digital data** via **leased lines**.
- Based on **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)** ‚Üí Each channel gets its own time slot.
- **DS0** = 64 Kbps channel (enough for one voice call).
- **T1/DS1** = 24 DS0 channels ‚Üí 1.544 Mbps full-duplex (voice & data).
- T1 lines can be combined for higher bandwidth.
- **Data Link Protocols**: HDLC, PPP.

**Analogy**:  
Think of TDM like a single-lane bridge with a timed traffic light ‚Äî each car (channel) gets a turn.

### üß± Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
- Sends data over **voice-grade telephone lines** (local loop).
- DSL modem = CPE, often part of a wireless router.
- Requires a **splitter/filter** to prevent noise between voice & data.

**DSL Types**:
- **ADSL**: Fast download, slower upload.
  - Latest ADSL2+ ‚Üí ~24 Mbps down, 1.25‚Äì2.5 Mbps up.
- **SDSL**: Same up & down speeds ‚Üí good for business/branch offices.

**Analogy**:  
Like using the same hallway for both walking and talking ‚Äî a splitter keeps the two from tripping over each other.

### üß± Cable Internet
- Delivered over **Cable TV (CATV)** infrastructure.
- Often **Hybrid Fiber-Coax (HFC)**: fiber backbone + coax to CPE.
- **Setup**: Cable modem ‚Üí Router via Ethernet; coax links modem to provider‚Äôs CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System).
- **DOCSIS** standard:
  - Up to 38 Mbps down (NA), 50 Mbps down (EU).
  - Up to 27 Mbps up.
  - DOCSIS 3.0 = multiplexed channels for higher speeds.

**Analogy**:  
Your house is one of many on the same coax ‚Äústreet‚Äù leading to the ISP ‚Äî like neighbors sharing a single water main.
