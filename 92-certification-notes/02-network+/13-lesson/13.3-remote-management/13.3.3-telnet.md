## 13.3.3 – Telnet

### 📜 Summary
- **Telnet** is both a **protocol** and a **terminal emulation software tool** used to send shell commands and receive output between a client and a remote host.
- The remote host must run the **Telnet Daemon**, which by default listens on **TCP port 23**.
- Telnet can require a **password**, but **all communications (including passwords) are unencrypted**.
- Because it’s unencrypted, it’s vulnerable to:
  - 🕵 Packet sniffing
  - 🔁 Replay attacks
- Historically used for configuring switches and routers, but **now replaced by secure methods** (e.g., SSH).
- Best practice:
  - 🔒 Disable or uninstall the Telnet service
  - 🚫 Block access to port 23
- If Telnet is **unavoidable for legacy systems**, isolate them on a **secure network segment**.

### 🚢 Analogy – “The Open Megaphone”
Imagine you’re shouting instructions to a ship’s crew across the harbor using a megaphone 📢.
- Everyone—including pirates—can hear your commands.
- Even if you say a password, it’s heard by everyone on shore.
- This is Telnet: direct and simple, but **no privacy at all**.
- SSH is like using an encrypted walkie-talkie 📡—only your crew can understand you.
