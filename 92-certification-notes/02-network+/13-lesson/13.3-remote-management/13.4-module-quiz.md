# QUESTION 1
You are a network administrator tasked with setting up a new router for your company's branch office. You need to configure the router before it can be connected to the company's network. You have a laptop with terminal emulator software installed.

Which of the following methods should you use to initially configure the router?

❌ Connect your laptop to the router's wireless network and configure it using a web interface.  
❌ Use an SSH connection over the Internet to remotely access the router's command line interface.  
❌ Send configuration commands to the router via email and wait for it to automatically configure itself.  
✅ Connect your laptop to the router's console port using a console cable and configure it through the terminal emulator.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Wireless web interface** — Usually unavailable until the router is configured; not suitable for initial setup.  
- ❌ **SSH over Internet** — Requires the router to already be online and reachable, which it isn’t yet.  
- ❌ **Email commands** — Not a supported or secure configuration method for routers.

# QUESTION 2
What is the foundation level of T-carrier for leased line data services known as?  

❌ DS3  
✅ DS1 or T1  
❌ DS2  
❌ DS0  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **DS3** — This is a higher-level T-carrier service with much greater bandwidth (44.736 Mbps), not the foundation level.  
- ❌ **DS2** — Another intermediate level (6.312 Mbps), but still above the foundational service.  
- ❌ **DS0** — Represents a single 64 Kbps channel; it’s the building block, not the standard base service for leased lines.

# QUESTION 3
What role does a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) play in a cable internet setup?  

❌ It converts analog signals to digital.  
✅ It routes data traffic via the fiber backbone.  
❌ It serves as a backup connection point.  
❌ It encrypts data transmissions.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **It converts analog signals to digital** — That’s handled by the cable modem, not the CMTS.  
- ❌ **It serves as a backup connection point** — A CMTS is a central routing device, not a backup link.  
- ❌ **It encrypts data transmissions** — Encryption is not its primary job; its main role is routing data traffic to the ISP’s network.

# QUESTION 4
What is the primary difference between ADSL and SDSL?

❌ ADSL is more secure than SDSL.  
✅ SDSL offers the same uplink and downlink speeds, unlike ADSL.  
❌ SDSL uses coaxial cables, while ADSL uses telephone lines.  
❌ ADSL offers faster speeds than SDSL.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **ADSL is more secure than SDSL** — Security isn’t the defining difference; speed symmetry is.  
- ❌ **SDSL uses coaxial cables, while ADSL uses telephone lines** — Both use telephone lines, not coaxial.  
- ❌ **ADSL offers faster speeds than SDSL** — ADSL typically has faster download speeds but slower upload speeds; SDSL balances both equally.

# QUESTION 5
Why is Telnet considered to be insecure?

❌ It uses strong encryption for all communications.  
✅ It transmits data in plain text.  
❌ It automatically blocks access to port 23.  
❌ It can only transmit text, not binary files.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **It uses strong encryption for all communications** — Telnet doesn’t use encryption at all, which is the whole problem.  
- ❌ **It automatically blocks access to port 23** — Port 23 is the default Telnet port; it’s not blocked by the protocol itself.  
- ❌ **It can only transmit text, not binary files** — Telnet can send binary data, but it’s still unencrypted.

# QUESTION 6
What is the major obstacle to providing WAN access that can approach LAN performance?

❌ Availability of skilled technicians  
❌ The cost of fiber optic cables  
❌ The complexity of network protocols  
✅ Bandwidth in the last mile  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Availability of skilled technicians** — While skilled labor is important, it’s not the primary bottleneck for WAN speeds.  
- ❌ **The cost of fiber optic cables** — Cost matters, but performance limits are more about physical bandwidth constraints.  
- ❌ **The complexity of network protocols** — Protocol complexity affects efficiency but doesn’t create the biggest gap between WAN and LAN.

# QUESTION 7
Which of the following is a risk associated with storing credentials on a remote access server?

❌ Improved security through obscurity  
❌ Easier synchronization of accounts and credentials  
❌ Simplification of the authentication process  
✅ Increased vulnerability to attacks  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Improved security through obscurity** — This isn’t a real security improvement; obscurity alone doesn’t address core vulnerabilities.  
- ❌ **Easier synchronization of accounts and credentials** — That’s a convenience benefit, not a risk.  
- ❌ **Simplification of the authentication process** — This can be positive, not necessarily a security threat.  
---
# QUESTION 8
What is the role of a modem in a WAN?

❌ To increase the speed of the internet connection  
❌ To serve as a firewall and provide security  
❌ To connect multiple LANs within an organization  
✅ To perform modulation and demodulation of data  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **To increase the speed of the internet connection** — A modem doesn’t inherently speed up your connection; it just enables communication over the medium.  
- ❌ **To serve as a firewall and provide security** — That’s the role of a firewall, not a modem.  
- ❌ **To connect multiple LANs within an organization** — This is done by routers or switches, not modems.

# QUESTION 9
You work as a field engineer and frequently need to access sensitive project data stored on your company's network while visiting client sites. For security reasons, your company requires that all internet traffic, including browsing and email, be monitored and filtered through the corporate network's security appliances.

Which VPN configuration would best suit your needs?

❌ Split tunnel  
❌ Peer-to-peer VPN  
✅ Full tunnel  
❌ Site-to-site VPN  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Split tunnel** — Only routes specific traffic through the VPN, allowing other traffic to bypass corporate monitoring, which violates the requirement.  
- ❌ **Peer-to-peer VPN** — Designed for direct connections between users, not centralized corporate monitoring.  
- ❌ **Site-to-site VPN** — Connects entire networks, not individual remote workers.

# QUESTION 10
What is the benefit of using automation and orchestration in the context of a jump box?

❌ To manually configure appliances  
❌ To eliminate the need for a firewall  
❌ To reduce the need for secure connections  
✅ To configure appliances via scripts efficiently  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **To manually configure appliances** — Automation replaces manual work, it doesn’t require it.  
- ❌ **To eliminate the need for a firewall** — Firewalls are still required for network security regardless of automation.  
- ❌ **To reduce the need for secure connections** — Secure connections remain necessary; automation doesn’t replace encryption or VPNs.

# QUESTION 11
What is the primary purpose of remote authentication?

❌ To ensure that all users have unlimited access to network resources  
❌ To authenticate users only within the same physical location  
✅ To allow a user to start a session over a network via another host  
❌ To prevent users from accessing any network resources  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **To ensure that all users have unlimited access to network resources** — Authentication controls access, it doesn’t grant unlimited permissions.  
- ❌ **To authenticate users only within the same physical location** — Remote authentication is designed for users outside the local network.  
- ❌ **To prevent users from accessing any network resources** — The goal is to allow legitimate access, not block it entirely.

# QUESTION 12
What technology allows a browser to draw and update a desktop with relatively little lag, enabling the use of clientless VPNs?

❌ CSS3  
❌ AJAX  
✅ HTML5  
❌ JavaScript  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **CSS3** — Handles styling and layout, not real-time interactive desktop rendering.  
- ❌ **AJAX** — Enables asynchronous web requests, but it’s not optimized for high-performance desktop streaming.  
- ❌ **JavaScript** — A programming language that can handle dynamic content, but HTML5’s canvas and related APIs specifically enable efficient remote desktop rendering in browsers.

# QUESTION 13
A network administrator is tasked with enhancing the security of their company’s cloud network, which is exposed to the Internet. The administrator decides to implement a jump box to manage administrative access to servers within the secure zone.  

Which of the following actions should the network administrator take to ensure the jump box effectively improves network security?  

❌ Use the root user account for all administrative tasks through the jump box to simplify access management.  
✅ Ensure the jump box is the only host with administrative access to servers in the secure zone.  
❌ Set up the jump box without any encryption protocols for faster connectivity.  
❌ Configure the jump box to allow administrative access from any host on the Internet.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Use the root user account for all administrative tasks** — Violates least privilege; increases risk if credentials are compromised.  
- ❌ **No encryption protocols** — Would make all admin traffic visible to attackers; defeats the security purpose.  
- ❌ **Allow admin access from any host** — Creates unnecessary exposure; should limit access to trusted IPs/networks.

# QUESTION 14
A multinational corporation operates offices in multiple countries, each with its own local network. The company wants to ensure that all offices can access resources on the other networks securely and efficiently, without exposing any data to the public Internet.  

What is the BEST approach to achieve this?  

❌ Creating multiple remote access VPN connections for users in each office  
✅ Establishing a site-to-site VPN between each office's network  
❌ Configuring a public Wi-Fi network for inter-office communications  
❌ Using a cloud storage service for inter-office file sharing  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Multiple remote access VPNs** — Designed for individual users, not for connecting entire networks together.  
- ❌ **Public Wi-Fi for inter-office communications** — Completely insecure and would expose traffic to interception.  
- ❌ **Cloud storage for file sharing** — Only covers file transfer, not full secure network-to-network connectivity.  
---
# QUESTION 15
How does a jump box enhance network security?  

❌ By broadcasting administrative access widely  
❌ By reducing the use of encryption  
❌ By storing all network data in one location  
✅ By acting as the only entry point for administrative access  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Broadcasting administrative access** — This would create massive vulnerabilities by exposing credentials to more potential attackers.  
- ❌ **Reducing encryption use** — Weakens security, making sensitive connections easier to compromise.  
- ❌ **Storing all network data in one location** — Creates a single point of failure and does not inherently control access.
