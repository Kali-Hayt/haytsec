## 13.3.2 Secure Shell (SSH) 🖥️🔐

### 🧾 Key Concepts
- **Terminal (TTY)**: In early computing, a TTY (teletype) was the endpoint for communication between a user and a computer’s shell.  
  - 📥 **Input**: User types commands  
  - 📤 **Output**: System displays results  
  - **Shell**: Executes commands and processes tasks.
- **Terminal Emulator**: Software that replicates the TTY function, allowing connections to remote systems’ shells over a network.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**:  
  - Provides **secure remote access** to UNIX/Linux servers and network appliances (switches, routers, firewalls).
  - Also supports **secure file transfers** via **SFTP**.
  - Runs on **TCP port 22** by default.
  - Most common implementation: **OpenSSH**.

### 🔑 SSH Host Key
- An SSH server is identified by a **public/private key pair** called the **host key**.
- Hostnames → public keys mapping can be stored manually or via enterprise SSH key management tools.

### 👤 SSH Client Authentication Methods
1. **Username/password** – Checked against local DB or network authentication server.
2. **Public key authentication** – Each user’s public key is stored on the server for their account.
3. **Kerberos** – Uses Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to authenticate via GSSAPI.

⚠ **Key Management Tip**: Poor management can lead to compromise. If a private key is compromised:
- Delete public key from server.
- Regenerate new key pair.
- Deploy updated public key.

### 🛠 Secure Shell Commands
- **`sshd`** – Start the SSH server (daemon).
- **`ssh-keygen`** – Create a key pair for access.
- **`ssh-agent`** – Store and manage keys for multiple hosts.
- **`ssh Host`** – Connect to a remote host.
- **`ssh Username@Host`** – Connect with a specific username.
- **`ssh Host "Command"`** – Run a remote command without opening a full shell.
- **`scp Username@Host:RemoteFile /Local/Destination`** – Secure copy a file.
- **`sftp`** – Secure FTP-like interface for file transfer.

### 🚢 Analogy: SSH as a Secure Docking Port
Think of **SSH** like a **secure docking bridge** between two ships:
- The **dock** (SSH) ensures the connection between ships is safe from pirates (attackers).
- **Host keys** are like the ship’s ID papers, proving it’s the real ship.
- **Authentication methods** are the checkpoints you must pass (passport check, cargo manifest, VIP pass).
- **Commands** are like messages, orders, or cargo sent across the dock securely.
