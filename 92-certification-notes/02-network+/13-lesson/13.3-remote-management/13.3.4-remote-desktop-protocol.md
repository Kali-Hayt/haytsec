## 13.3.4 – Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 🖥️

### 📌 Overview
- **Purpose:** Unlike Telnet and SSH (command line only), RDP provides **graphical remote access** with mouse & keyboard control.
- **Function:** Sends **screen & audio** from remote host → client, and **mouse/keyboard input** from client → remote host.
- **Protocol & Port:** Microsoft protocol using **TCP 3389**.
- **Main Use:** Remote GUI connections to Windows systems.

### 🔒 Security Features
- **Permissions & Encryption:** Admins can restrict who connects and enable encryption.
- **Network Level Authentication (NLA):** Authenticates user **before** loading a desktop session → mitigates DoS & malicious pending connections.
- **Risks:** If connecting to a malware-infected server, your credentials can be stolen.
- **Mitigations:**
  - **RDP Restricted Admin Mode (RDPRA)**
  - **Remote Credential Guard**
  - Use **Secure Administrative Workstation (SAW)** for critical accounts (minimal apps, low attack surface).

---

### 🌍 Alternatives to RDP
- **Cross-platform tools:** TeamViewer, VNC (Virtual Network Computing).
- **Application Virtualization:** Run software on server → stream to client without local install.
- **Remote Desktop Gateway:** Provides secure access to virtual desktops or apps (also offered by Citrix).

### ⚓ Analogy – “Captain’s Bridge via Video Feed”
Think of RDP like a **ship captain controlling a distant vessel via live camera and remote controls**:
- Telnet/SSH = captain sends **text commands** over radio.
- RDP = captain sees the **ship’s wheel, radar, and instruments in real time**, and steers with the mouse/keyboard.
- NLA = security guard checking your ID **before** opening the bridge doors.
- RDPRA & Credential Guard = keeping your captain’s keys locked in a secure vault so pirates can’t steal them.
