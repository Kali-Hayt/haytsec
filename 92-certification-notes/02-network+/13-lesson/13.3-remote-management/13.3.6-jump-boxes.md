## 📦 13.3.6 – Jump Boxes

### 📝 Summary
- Managing **Internet-exposed hosts** (like in a screened subnet or cloud) is tricky — you must allow admin access but avoid leaving the network open to attacks.
- Without controls, an **admin interface** could be compromised and used as a **pivot point** into the network.
- **Solution:** Use a **Jump Box** (aka jump host/server) inside the secure zone.
    - Jump box runs **only necessary admin services** (e.g., SSH, RDP).
    - Admins connect **first** to the jump box, then from there to the target server.
    - Target server’s **ACL** (Access Control List) allows only the jump box to connect.
- This setup makes access **tightly controlled** and easier to audit.

### ⚓ Analogy – The Port Security Checkpoint
Imagine a **military harbor** 🪖:
- Ships (admins) can’t dock directly at sensitive naval bases (servers).
- Instead, **all ships must dock at the checkpoint pier** (jump box).
- From the checkpoint, only vetted crew members are ferried to the base in **secured transport boats** (SSH/RDP).
- The base **never accepts visitors from anywhere else**, only from that checkpoint.

**Result:** Controlled access, fewer entry points, and easier monitoring of who goes where.
