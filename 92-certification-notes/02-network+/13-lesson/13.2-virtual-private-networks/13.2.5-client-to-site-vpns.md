## 13.2.5 Client-to-Site VPNs

### üß± What It Is
- VPN topology where a **client** connects over a public network to a **VPN gateway** at the corporate edge.
- Often called the **telecommuter model**:
  - For remote workers or field employees.
  - VPN gateway is typically in a screened subnet for security.

### üß± Protocols Used
- **SSL/TLS VPN** ‚Üí uses certificates for tunnel security.
  - Example: **SSTP** (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol, Microsoft).
- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)** ‚Üí often paired with IPSec for encryption.
- **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)** ‚Üí ‚ùå obsolete due to serious security flaws.
- All require **client software**.
- Authentication often via **EAP** + **AAA/RADIUS**.

### üß± Internet Access Options for Remote Clients
- **Split Tunnel**:
  - Corporate traffic goes through the VPN.
  - Internet traffic goes directly via ISP‚Äôs routers/DNS.
  - ‚úÖ Lower latency, less load on VPN.
  - ‚ùå Less secure ‚Äî internet traffic is not inspected by corporate network.

- **Full Tunnel**:
  - All traffic (corporate + internet) goes through the VPN.
  - Corporate network changes client IP/DNS; may use a proxy.
  - ‚úÖ Better security ‚Äî everything is monitored.
  - ‚ùå Higher latency, possible site issues (especially with cloud services), more bandwidth use.

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway
Client-to-site VPNs are like **secure company shuttles**:
- Split tunnel = you take the shuttle to work but drive your own car for errands.
- Full tunnel = you ride the shuttle everywhere, but it‚Äôs slower and makes all stops.
