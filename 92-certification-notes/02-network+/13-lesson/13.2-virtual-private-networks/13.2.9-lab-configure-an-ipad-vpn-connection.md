**Score:** 100%

### Steps  

1. **Verify Wi-Fi Connection**  
   - On iPad, go to `Settings` → `Wi-Fi`.  
   - Confirm connection to `Home-Wireless` network.

2. **Add and Configure VPN**  
   - Navigate: `Settings` → `General` → `VPN`.  
   - Select `Add VPN Configuration`.  
   - Choose `IPSec`.  
   - Enter details:  
     - Description: `CorpNetVPN`  
     - Server: `198.28.56.22`  
     - Account: `mbrown`  
     - Secret: `asdf1234$`  
   - Save.

3. **Connect to VPN**  
   - Under VPN Configuration, toggle **Not Connected** to **ON**.  
   - When prompted, enter password: `L3tM31nN0w` (0 = zero).  
   - Select `OK`.

### Key Concepts  
- **IPSec VPN**: Provides encrypted and authenticated IP communication between devices.  
- **Pre-Shared Key (Secret)**: Used for Phase 1 authentication in IPSec tunnels.  
- **Separate Account Password**: Distinct from the secret, used for user-level authentication.  
- iOS requires VPN configuration before enabling — no background VPN setup.
