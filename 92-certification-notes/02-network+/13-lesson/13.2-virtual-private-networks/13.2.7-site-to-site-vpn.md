## 13.2.7 Site-to-Site VPNs

### ðŸ§± What It Is
- Connects **two or more private networks** together securely.
- Unlike remote access VPNs (initiated by clients), site-to-site VPNs:
  - Operate automatically.
  - Are configured between gateways.
  - Use agreed-upon VPN protocols to exchange security information.

---

### ðŸ§± How It Works
- Gateways form a **trust relationship** and maintain a secure tunnel.
- Hosts at each site:
  - Donâ€™t need VPN configuration.
  - Route traffic normally â€” gateway decides whether to send it locally or via VPN.
- Also known as **compulsory tunneling**:
  - **Static** â†’ tunnel always on.
  - **Dynamic** â†’ tunnel created as needed (based on traffic type/client type).

---

### ðŸ§± Variations
- **Not always over the public internet**:
  - WAN providers can create private VPNs inside their infrastructure.
  - VLAN-like isolation keeps customer data separate.
- **Local VPN segmentation**:
  - VPNs can isolate sensitive network segments (e.g., SCADA in IIoT environments).

### âœ… Key Takeaway
Site-to-site VPNs are like **private highways** between offices:
- Always there when needed (static) or opened on demand (dynamic).
- Can run over the public internet or a providerâ€™s private network.
- Also useful within the same building to isolate and secure critical systems.
