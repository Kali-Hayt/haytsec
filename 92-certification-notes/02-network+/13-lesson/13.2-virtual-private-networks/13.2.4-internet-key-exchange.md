## 13.2.4 Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

### ðŸ§± What It Is
- Protocol used with IPSec to:
  - Implement authentication.
  - Select mutually supported cryptographic ciphers.
  - Exchange encryption keys.
- Results in a **Security Association (SA)** â†’ the agreed-upon set of properties for the secure connection.
- IPSec policy defines:
  - Authentication method.
  - Use of AH and/or ESP.
  - Transport or tunnel mode.

---

### ðŸ§± Role in IPSec
- IPSec encryption & hashing require a **shared secret**.
- IKE ensures both peers:
  - Know the shared secret.
  - Perform **mutual authentication**.
- Enables secure communication between peers.

---

### ðŸ§± IKE Negotiation Phases
1. **Phase I**:
   - Establishes peer identities and agrees on a shared key.
   - Uses **Diffie-Hellman** algorithm for key exchange.
   - Authentication methods:
     - **Digital certificates** â†’ issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.
     - **Pre-shared key (group authentication)** â†’ same passphrase configured on both peers.
2. **Phase II**:
   - Uses the secure channel from Phase I.
   - Negotiates ciphers and key sizes for AH/ESP in the IPSec session.

### ðŸ§± IKE Versions
- **IKEv1**:
  - Designed for site-to-site and host-to-host topologies.
  - Requires another protocol to support remote access VPNs.
- **IKEv2**:
  - Adds features making it viable for stand-alone client-to-site VPNs.
  - **Enhancements**:
    - Supports EAP authentication (e.g., user login via RADIUS).
    - Simpler setup mode â†’ reduced bandwidth without losing security.
    - NAT traversal â†’ allows tunnels through home routers/firewalls.
    - MOBIKE multihoming â†’ maintains VPN when switching between interfaces (Wi-Fi â†” cellular).

---

### âœ… Key Takeaway
IKE is the **handshake and negotiation table** of IPSec:
- Phase I â†’ "Letâ€™s meet, verify IDs, and agree on a secret."
- Phase II â†’ "Now we decide exactly how to protect our conversation."
- IKEv2 makes the handshake smarter, faster, and more mobile-friendly.
