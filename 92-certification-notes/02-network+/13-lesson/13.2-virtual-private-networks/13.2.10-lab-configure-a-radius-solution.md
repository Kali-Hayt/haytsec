## 13.2.10 Lab: Configure a RADIUS Solution  
**Score:** 100%  
**Time Spent:** 34:57  

### Scenario  
Due to the success of your remote access solution, multiple VPN servers now require centralized authentication. You configure `CorpNPS` as a RADIUS server using Microsoft NPS to manage policies and authenticate users from a central point.

---

### Steps  

1. **Add the Network Policy and Access Services Role**  
   - From Server Manager: `Manage > Add Roles and Features`  
   - Role-based or feature-based installation → Select destination server: `CorpNPS.CorpNet.local`  
   - Select role: **Network Policy and Access Services**  
   - Add management features → Next → Next → Install  
   - Close after installation.

2. **Configure RADIUS Clients in NPS**  
   - In Server Manager: `Tools > Network Policy Server`  
   - Expand **RADIUS Clients and Servers**  
   - Right-click **RADIUS Clients** → New  
   - Add for each:  
     - **Friendly name**: `CorpVPN1` / `BranchVPN1`  
     - **Address**: `192.168.0.20` / `192.168.20.20`  
     - **Shared secret**: `J51nj3T%` (enter & confirm)  
     - **Vendor name**: `RADIUS Standard`  
   - OK.

3. **Create the Sales Network Policy**  
   - Expand **Policies** → Right-click **Network Policies** → New  
   - Name: `Sales`  
   - Type of network access server: `Remote Access Server (VPN-Dialup)`  
   - Add condition: Group membership = **Sales** group  
   - Grant access if conditions are met  
   - Authentication method: **Microsoft Smart Card or Other Certificate**  
   - Uncheck less secure methods  
   - Use defaults for constraints and settings → Finish.

4. **Configure BranchVPN1 as a RADIUS Client**  
   - Open `Routing and Remote Access` → Right-click BranchVPN1 → Properties → Security tab  
   - Authentication provider: **RADIUS Authentication** → Configure → Add  
   - RADIUS server: `CorpNPS`  
   - Shared secret: `J51nj3T%` (enter & confirm) → OK  
   - Accounting provider: **RADIUS Accounting** → Configure → Add  
   - Server: `CorpNPS` → Shared secret: `J51nj3T%` → OK.

5. **Configure CorpVPN1 as a RADIUS Client**  
   - Repeat the same process as BranchVPN1.

### Key Concepts  
- **NPS (Network Policy Server)** is Microsoft’s RADIUS server implementation.  
- **Centralized authentication** reduces admin overhead and keeps access control consistent across multiple VPN servers.  
- **Shared secret** ensures trust between RADIUS clients (VPN servers) and the RADIUS server.  
- **Group-based policies** allow access only to authorized departments (e.g., Sales).  
- **Certificate-based authentication** improves security by requiring something you have (smart card/cert) in addition to credentials.
