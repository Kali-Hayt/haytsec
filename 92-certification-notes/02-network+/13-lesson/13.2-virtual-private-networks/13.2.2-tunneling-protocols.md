## 13.2.2 Tunneling Protocols

### üß± What It Is
- Modern remote access often uses **VPNs** to create a **secure tunnel** for private communications over the internet.
- **Tunneling** = wrapping a local network packet inside a public network packet for delivery.
- Process:
  1. Local packet is usually encrypted.
  2. Encapsulated inside a public packet.
  3. On arrival, the remote access server removes public headers, decrypts, and forwards it over the local network.

### üß± Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
- **Layer**: Data Link (Layer 2).
- Function: Encapsulates IP packets for transmission over serial digital lines.
- ‚ùå No built-in security ‚Üí must be paired with other protocols for secure tunnels.

---

### üß± Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
- **Layer**: Network (Layer 3).
- Function: Encapsulates IP packets (or other network layer protocols) inside GRE packets.
- Process:
  - GRE packet has its own IP source + header.
  - Encapsulated again in a Layer 2 frame for next-hop transmission.
  - Intermediate routers look only at GRE header.
  - Destination router removes GRE wrapper, delivers inner packet.
- ‚ùå No authentication ‚Üí often paired with other VPN protocols.

### üß± IP Security (IPSec)
- **Layer**: Network (Layer 3).
- Function: Authenticates hosts and encrypts packets.
- Use: Works with other protocols for secure VPN connections; can also be a standalone VPN solution.

---

### üß± Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Datagram TLS (DTLS)
- **Layer**: Session (TLS over TCP) or Transport-like (DTLS over UDP).
- Function: Encapsulates frames or IP packets.
- Drawback: TLS already operates at the session layer, so inner + outer headers add significant overhead.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway
Tunneling protocols are like **Russian nesting dolls for data**:
- The inner doll = your original packet.
- Each layer wraps it up for a specific job ‚Äî encryption, routing, authentication.
- Some wrappers add security, others just handle the delivery.
