## 📘 Simplifying IPv6 Addresses

### 🧱 What is an IPv6 Address?
- IPv6 uses **128-bit** addresses written in **hexadecimal**, divided into **8 blocks** (also called *hextets*).
- Example (fully expanded):  
  `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`

---

### 🧱 Step 1: Drop Leading Zeros
- If any block starts with `0`s, **remove them**.
- Example:  
  `0042` becomes `42`  
  `0db8` becomes `db8`

Updated:  
`2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:42:8329`

✅ But leave *at least one* digit per block. `0000` becomes `0`, not blank.

---

### 🧱 Step 2: Collapse Longest Run of All-Zero Blocks
- You can **replace the longest group of consecutive `0`s** with `::`
- In the example, we have: `0:0:0` → we can compress that into `::`

Final simplified version:  
`2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`

---

### 🔍 Rules to Remember
- You can only use `::` **once** in an address. If there are two groups of zeros, compress the **longest one**.
- Don’t skip non-zero blocks — `2001::db8` is ❌ wrong if `db8` wasn’t part of a zero group.

### ✅ Final Summary
| Rule                              | Example Before                        | Example After                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Drop leading zeros                | `0042`                                 | `42`                           |
| Collapse longest zero group       | `0:0:0`                                | `::`                           |
| Can only use `::` once            | `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1`                      | `::1` (loopback)              |
| Each section = 16 bits            | 8 blocks of hex                        | Total: 128 bits               |

### 🧠 Analogy
Think of it like **trimming a postal address**:  
> Full: "0001 Zero Street, Zero City, Zero State, USA"  
> Shortened: "::USA"

Still points to the same destination, just easier to read.
