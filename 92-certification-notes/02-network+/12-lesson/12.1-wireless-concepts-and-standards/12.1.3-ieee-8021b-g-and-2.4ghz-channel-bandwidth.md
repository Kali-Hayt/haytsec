## 12.1.3 â€“ IEEE 802.11b/g and 2.4GHz Channel Bandwidth

### ðŸ“¡ IEEE 802.11b

- Released alongside 802.11a, but used **2.4 GHz** instead of 5 GHz.
- Adopted:
  - **DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)**
  - **CCK (Complementary Code Keying)** for signal encoding.
- Data rate: **11 Mbps**
- Despite being slower than 802.11a, it:
  - Hit the market faster
  - Became more widely adopted

## ðŸŸ§ 2.4 GHz Channel Characteristics

### ðŸ“Š Channel Layout

- Frequency range: **2412 MHz to 2484 MHz**
- Up to **14 channels**, spaced **5 MHz apart**
- But DSSS requires **22 MHz** per channel â†’ leads to significant **overlap**

### ðŸ“› Overlap & Interference

- Heavy channel overlap = high chance of **co-channel interference**
- Only **3 non-overlapping channels**: **1, 6, and 11**
- Regional availability:
  - **Americas**: channels 1â€“11
  - **Europe**: channels 1â€“13
  - **Japan**: channels 1â€“14

## ðŸŸ¦ IEEE 802.11g

- Designed as a **drop-in upgrade** for 802.11b
- Operates in **2.4 GHz band**, same layout
- Uses **OFDM** like 802.11a â†’ better performance
- Data rate: **54 Mbps**
- **Backwards compatible** with 802.11b
  - Falls back to **DSSS** when talking to 802.11b clients

## ðŸ§± Summary of Modulation & Bandwidth

| Standard  | Band     | Max Speed | Modulation | Notes                              |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|------------------------------------|
| 802.11b   | 2.4 GHz  | 11 Mbps   | DSSS + CCK | First widespread Wi-Fi standard    |
| 802.11g   | 2.4 GHz  | 54 Mbps   | OFDM       | Compatible w/ b, same channels     |
| 802.11a   | 5 GHz    | 54 Mbps   | OFDM       | Faster but shorter range than b/g  |
