## 12.1.1 – IEEE 802.11 Wireless Standards

### 🧱 What is IEEE 802.11?

- IEEE 802.11 is the set of standards that defines how Wi-Fi works.
- It operates at the **Physical (Layer 1)** and **Data Link (Layer 2)** layers of the OSI model.
- Defines how data is modulated onto radio signals for wireless transmission.

### 📡 Radio Wave Fundamentals

- Data is encoded onto **radio carrier signals** using modulation.
- Modulation modifies:
  - **Amplitude** (height of wave)
  - **Frequency** (number of cycles per second)
  - **Phase** (position of wave in its cycle)

### 🔐 Modulation Schemes

- Different schemes used to resist interference from:
  - Noise
  - Other radio sources

## 📶 Wireless Communication Model (802.11)

### 🔁 Half-Duplex Shared Medium

- All stations share the same medium.
- Can transmit or receive, but **not both simultaneously**.

### 🚦 CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)

- Wireless equivalent of Ethernet’s CSMA/CD.
- Goal: Avoid collisions before they occur.
  
#### How it works:
1. **Carrier Sense**: Listen before transmitting.
2. If busy, wait (random backoff).
3. If clear, send data.
4. Receiver sends **ACK** if frame is received correctly.
5. If no ACK, sender resends.

#### 🔍 Virtual Carrier Sense (RTS/CTS):
- Prevents collisions by reserving the medium.
- Sender sends **RTS (Request to Send)**.
- Receiver replies with **CTS (Clear to Send)**.
- Other devices stay silent during reserved period.

## 🌐 Wi-Fi Topology and Components

### 🧭 Logical Topology

- Uses **star topology** in most WLANs.
- Central node = **Access Point (AP)**
- Clients = **Stations**

### 📡 Access Point Role

- AP controls communication between client radios.
- Acts as bridge between wired and wireless networks.

## ⚙️ Standards and Speeds

- Original 802.11 = **1 Mbps**
- Has evolved like 802.3 Ethernet:
  - New versions improve speed and reliability.
  - Different standards (e.g., 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax)

### ✅ Certification

- Products are certified by the **Wi-Fi Alliance**.
- Ensures interoperability across vendors.
