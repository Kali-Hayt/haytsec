# QUESTION 1

What is the effect of operating in High Throughput (HT)/greenfield mode?

❌ It reduces overall WLAN performance.  
❌ It increases compatibility with older standards.  
✅ It maximizes performance.  
❌ It increases the number of available channels.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It reduces overall WLAN performance**: Greenfield mode is optimized for speed, not degradation. It skips legacy protection mechanisms.
- ❌ **It increases compatibility with older standards**: Nope — quite the opposite. Greenfield disables compatibility with legacy (802.11a/b/g) devices to streamline throughput.
- ❌ **It increases the number of available channels**: Channel count doesn’t change — greenfield just uses what's already there more efficiently.

# QUESTION 2

What additional feature does the IEEE 802.11h standard introduce to the 5 GHz band?

❌ Enhanced encryption  
✅ Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)  
❌ Increased data rates  
❌ Reduced channel width

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Enhanced encryption**: That’s handled by other amendments like 802.11i (WPA2), not 802.11h.
- ❌ **Increased data rates**: Data rate improvements come from amendments like 802.11n/ac/ax — not 802.11h.
- ❌ **Reduced channel width**: Channel width changes (like 20 MHz to 40 MHz) are part of other specs (e.g., 802.11n), not 802.11h.

# QUESTION 3

What is the primary purpose of using Resource Units (RUs) in Wi-Fi 6?

❌ To increase the Wi-Fi signal range  
❌ To reduce the frequency of signal interference  
❌ To encrypt data packets for security  
✅ To allocate bandwidth more efficiently

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increase the Wi-Fi signal range**: Signal range depends on power, antenna design, and environment—not RUs.
- ❌ **Reduce signal interference**: Interference is reduced by better spectrum use and scheduling, but RUs focus on efficiency, not interference suppression directly.
- ❌ **Encrypt data packets for security**: That's a job for protocols like WPA3, not RUs.

# QUESTION 4

What is the primary purpose of the IEEE 802.11 standards?

✅ To define the physical layer media for wireless LANs  
❌ To define the protocols for wired networking  
❌ To establish security standards for the Internet  
❌ To regulate the manufacturing of wireless devices  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Wired networking protocols**: That’s 802.3 (Ethernet), not 802.11.
- ❌ **Security standards for the Internet**: Security standards like TLS or IPsec come from other groups like IETF.
- ❌ **Manufacturing regulation**: That’s the job of regulatory bodies like the FCC, not IEEE.

# QUESTION 5

What is a key difference between Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 regarding MU-MIMO?

✅ Wi-Fi 6 supports up to eight stations in parallel, while Wi-Fi 5 supports up to four.  
❌ Wi-Fi 6 does not support downlink MU-MIMO.  
❌ Wi-Fi 5 exclusively uses the 6 GHz band for MU-MIMO.  
❌ Wi-Fi 5 supports UL MU-MIMO, while Wi-Fi 6 does not.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Wi-Fi 6 does not support downlink MU-MIMO**: False. It supports both downlink and uplink MU-MIMO.
- ❌ **Wi-Fi 5 exclusively uses 6 GHz for MU-MIMO**: Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) operates in the 5 GHz band, not 6 GHz.
- ❌ **Wi-Fi 5 supports UL MU-MIMO**: Incorrect. Only Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) introduced **uplink** MU-MIMO.

# QUESTION 6

You are a network administrator tasked with setting up a Wi-Fi network in a large office building. The building has multiple floors with thick concrete walls and several electronic devices that could cause interference. Your primary goal is to ensure high data rates and minimal interference for the office's Wi-Fi network.

Given this scenario, which frequency band and configuration would be the most appropriate for your Wi-Fi network?

✅ Use the 5 GHz band because it supports higher data rates and has more individual channels.  
❌ Use the 2.4 GHz band because it is less congested and supports more individual channels.  
❌ Use the 5 GHz band but limit the power output to comply with regulatory constraints.  
❌ Use the 2.4 GHz band because it has better penetration through solid surfaces.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **2.4 GHz (less congested)** – While less congested in some cases, it offers fewer non-overlapping channels and slower data rates, leading to more interference and less performance in dense environments.
- ❌ **5 GHz with limited power** – Power limitations wouldn't solve the problem of interference or performance; it would likely weaken coverage.
- ❌ **2.4 GHz (better penetration)** – True about penetration, but the priority in this scenario is **performance** and **minimizing interference**, where 5 GHz wins.

🧠 **Pro tip:** Always align the band choice with your performance goals. 5 GHz is a high-performance highway, even if it doesn't go through as many walls.

# QUESTION 7

How many non-overlapping channels are recommended in the 2.4 GHz band for IEEE 802.11b to avoid co-channel interference?

❌ 14  
❌ 11  
❌ 13  
✅ 3

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **14** is the total number of channels available in some regions (like Japan), but most overlap. Only 3 are truly non-overlapping.
- ❌ **11** is the number of channels available in the U.S., but again, only 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping.
- ❌ **13** is the number available in Europe, but the overlap problem still exists.

🧱 Channels **1, 6, and 11** are spaced apart enough in the 2.4 GHz band to avoid overlap and interference.

# QUESTION 8

In which Wi-Fi standard was Downlink MU-MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) first introduced?

❌ Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)  
❌ Wi-Fi 6E  
❌ Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n)  
✅ Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)** improved MU-MIMO, adding *uplink* MU-MIMO—but didn’t introduce it.
- ❌ **Wi-Fi 6E** just extends Wi-Fi 6 into the 6 GHz band. It doesn't debut new MU-MIMO.
- ❌ **Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n)** introduced MIMO, but not *multi-user* MIMO (MU-MIMO).

🧱 MU-MIMO = Multiple Users, Multiple Input, Multiple Output — debuted for *downlink* in **Wi-Fi 5**, allowing APs to talk to multiple devices at once.

---
# QUESTION 9

What is the primary aim of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)?

❌ To double the speed of Wi-Fi 5  
❌ To support only the 2.4 GHz band  
❌ To eliminate the need for Wi-Fi passwords  
✅ To approximate 10G connection speeds

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Double the speed of Wi-Fi 5** – Wi-Fi 6’s goal is much more ambitious than just doubling; it aims to **approximate 10 Gbps**, using multiple improvements like better modulation (1024-QAM), OFDMA, and MU-MIMO.
- ❌ **2.4 GHz only** – Wi-Fi 6 uses **2.4 GHz**, **5 GHz**, and with Wi-Fi 6E, even **6 GHz**.
- ❌ **No Wi-Fi passwords** – Security wasn't the focus here. WPA3 did launch around the same time but is not a defining goal of 802.11ax.

🧠 **Remember**: Wi-Fi 6 is about *massive throughput* and *multi-device efficiency* — like upgrading from a two-lane road to a multilane superhighway.

# QUESTION 10

What is the function of the Request to Send (RTS) and Clear To Send (CTS) mechanism in IEEE 802.11 networks?

✅ To further reduce the incidence of collisions  
❌ To encrypt data transmissions  
❌ To assign IP addresses to devices  
❌ To increase the transmission speed

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To encrypt data transmissions** – RTS/CTS is a collision-avoidance technique, not a security protocol.
- ❌ **To assign IP addresses to devices** – That’s DHCP’s job, not anything to do with RTS/CTS.
- ❌ **To increase the transmission speed** – This mechanism actually introduces overhead and *can* reduce speed slightly to increase reliability.

🧱 RTS/CTS is used especially when **hidden nodes** are present — devices can’t “hear” each other but both talk to the AP. It helps **avoid collisions** by coordinating who can speak and when.

# QUESTION 11

Which of the following is a drawback of using an array of satellites positioned in low Earth orbit (LEO) for Internet access?

✅ The customer's premises antenna must periodically realign with the array.  
❌ The satellites provide unlimited bandwidth.  
❌ The satellites do not move relative to the surface of the Earth.  
❌ The technology offers higher latency than geostationary satellites.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The satellites provide unlimited bandwidth** – No technology offers *unlimited* bandwidth; bandwidth is still shared and limited.
- ❌ **The satellites do not move relative to the surface of the Earth** – That’s true for **geostationary** satellites. LEO satellites move fast and *do* change position constantly.
- ❌ **The technology offers higher latency than geostationary satellites** – It’s the opposite. LEO satellites are closer to Earth, so they offer **lower latency**.

🛰️ LEO satellites require tracking antennas or phased-array systems because they **move quickly** overhead, necessitating constant realignment.

# QUESTION 12

What does channel bonding achieve in the context of IEEE 802.11n?

✅ It combines two 20 MHz channels into a single 40 MHz channel.  
❌ It decreases the data rate.  
❌ It reduces the frequency range.  
❌ It limits the use of multiple antennas.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It decreases the data rate** – False. Channel bonding **increases** data rates by doubling channel width.
- ❌ **It reduces the frequency range** – Incorrect. It **uses more frequency**, not less, to achieve higher throughput.
- ❌ **It limits the use of multiple antennas** – Not related. That’s a function of MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output), not bonding.

🧱 Channel bonding is like widening a highway: instead of one 20 MHz lane, you get a 40 MHz super-lane to handle more data traffic faster.

# QUESTION 13

What is the effective range of a cellular base station?

❌ Up to 2 miles (3.2 km)  
❌ Up to 10 miles (16 km)  
✅ Up to 5 miles (8 km)  
❌ Up to 1 mile (1.6 km)

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **1 mile / 1.6 km** – Way too short. Even in urban density, coverage exceeds this range.
- ❌ **2 miles / 3.2 km** – Some urban towers may fall here, but it’s not the *effective average*.
- ❌ **10 miles / 16 km** – That's stretching it. Only ideal conditions and specialized setups may reach that, not standard deployments.

📡 **Pro Tip**: Cellular base stations vary in power and design — but **5 miles (8 km)** is the realistic effective max range for reliable service, especially in suburban and rural areas.

# QUESTION 14

What technology is used to connect the customer's premises to the satellite Internet service?

✅ VSAT satellite dish antenna  
❌ Fiber-optic cable  
❌ Ethernet cable  
❌ High-frequency radio waves

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Fiber-optic cable** – That’s for terrestrial connections, not satellite uplinks/downlinks.
- ❌ **Ethernet cable** – Used internally (e.g., modem to router), not for connecting to satellite infrastructure.
- ❌ **High-frequency radio waves** – Technically part of the transmission, but not the **customer's equipment**. The question asks **what the user installs**—not the signal properties.

🛰️ VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) = that little satellite dish on a building that talks to satellites. It's **exactly** how satellite internet is delivered to customers.

# QUESTION 15

Which of the following is a requirement for 4G and 5G devices to connect to the network?

✅ A SIM card or chip  
❌ A Wi-Fi password  
❌ An Ethernet cable  
❌ A Bluetooth connection

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A Wi-Fi password** – Only needed for Wi-Fi networks, not cellular networks.
- ❌ **An Ethernet cable** – Wired connections aren’t used for 4G/5G mobile devices.
- ❌ **A Bluetooth connection** – Bluetooth is for short-range device-to-device communication, not cellular networking.

🧠 A **SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module)** authenticates your device to the carrier’s network. No SIM = no access to 4G/5G.
