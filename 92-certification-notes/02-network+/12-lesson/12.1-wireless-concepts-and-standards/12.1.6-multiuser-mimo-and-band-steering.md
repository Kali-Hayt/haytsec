## 12.1.6 – Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) and Band Steering

---

## 📶 What Problem Does This Solve?

- In classic 802.11 (CSMA/CA), an AP talks to **one device at a time**
- Other clients wait in line — like a **single-lane bridge**

✅ MU-MIMO and band steering help:
- Boost efficiency
- Reduce latency
- Avoid congestion

## 🧱 Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO)

### ✅ What It Is:
- **MU-MIMO** = Access Point (AP) uses multiple antennas to **talk to multiple clients simultaneously**
- First introduced in **Wi-Fi 5** (802.11ac) for **downlink only**
- Enhanced in **Wi-Fi 6** (802.11ax) with **uplink MU-MIMO**

---

### 🧭 Spatial Stream Use

- Example: A 4x4:4 AP (4 transmit/4 receive/4 streams)
  - Can deliver 4 unique data streams to 4 different devices **at once**
  - Devices must be **spatially separated** (e.g., north/south/east/west)

📌 If two clients share the same angle (e.g., both to the north), they must **share that stream** → bandwidth split.

### 🔄 Direction Support

| Wi-Fi Version | DL MU-MIMO | UL MU-MIMO | Max Clients | Notes                  |
|---------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Wi-Fi 5       | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No      | 4 clients    | 5 GHz only             |
| Wi-Fi 6       | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes     | 8 clients    | Works in all bands     |

## 🚦 Band Steering

### ✅ What It Is:

- Technique used by dual-/tri-band APs to **guide clients** to the **best frequency band**
  - Usually prefers **5 GHz** or **6 GHz**
  - Helps keep **2.4 GHz free** for legacy/low-speed devices

### 🧠 How It Works:

- Reduces beacon broadcasts for 2.4 GHz
- Encourages clients to join higher bands when capable
- Sometimes uses signal strength as a hint (though imperfect)

---

### ⚙️ Example Scenario:

| Device Capabilities | Without Band Steering | With Band Steering |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| 2.4 GHz only        | Connects fine         | Connects fine      |
| Dual-band           | May choose 2.4 GHz    | Nudged to 5 GHz    |
| Tri-band (with 6GHz)| May get stuck on 5 GHz| Nudged to 6 GHz    |

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Warnings

- Band steering ≠ guaranteed success
  - Some devices still cling to 2.4 GHz like it’s 2005 🧓📱
- Alternative: Use **separate SSIDs** per band
- **AP doesn't use signal strength** directly in the decision — can lead to poor behavior in edge cases
