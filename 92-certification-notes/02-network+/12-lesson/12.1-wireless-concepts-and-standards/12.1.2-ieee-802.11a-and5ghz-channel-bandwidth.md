## 12.1.2 – IEEE 802.11a and 5GHz Channel Bandwidth

### 📡 Frequency Bands

- **Frequency band** = specific range of radio frequencies used by a wireless standard.
- Within each band, a wireless radio uses specific **channels**.
- The two most commonly used Wi-Fi bands:
  - **2.4 GHz**
  - **5 GHz**

## 📶 2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz

### 🟦 2.4 GHz
- ✅ Better at **penetrating solid objects** (walls, floors).
- ✅ Longer signal **range**.
- ❌ Limited number of **non-overlapping channels**.
- ❌ Often **congested** by other Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth.
- ❌ More prone to **interference**.
- 🔻 **Lower max data rates** than 5 GHz.

### 🟥 5 GHz
- ❌ Weaker at **penetrating obstacles**.
- ❌ Shorter range than 2.4 GHz.
- ✅ **Higher throughput** (less interference, more clean channels).
- ✅ Supports **more non-overlapping channels**.
- ✅ Suffers less from congestion.
- 🔺 Ideal for high-speed communication over **shorter distances**.

## 📜 IEEE 802.11a

- Introduced use of **5 GHz band** for Wi-Fi.
- Used **OFDM** (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) to improve spectral efficiency.
- Max **data rate**: **54 Mbps** (theoretical).
- First 802.11 standard to leverage high-frequency short-range communication.

---

## 🧱 5 GHz Channel Architecture

### 📏 Channel Size
- Channels are **20 MHz wide**.
- Total of **25 non-overlapping channels** (varies by region).

### 📡 DFS – Dynamic Frequency Selection
- 802.11h introduced **DFS**:
  - Scans for radar signals (used by weather/military).
  - Avoids using interfering frequencies.
- Some 5 GHz channels overlap with **radar frequencies**—thus, must be scanned before use.

---

## 🌍 Regulatory Factors

- Channel availability may vary by **country** or **region**.
- Regulations may:
  - Limit **power output** (to avoid long-range interference).
  - Restrict **which channels** can be used.
- Devices must comply with **local laws** and sometimes dynamically adapt.
