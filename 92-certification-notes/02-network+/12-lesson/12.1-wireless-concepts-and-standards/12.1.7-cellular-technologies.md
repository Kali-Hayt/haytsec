## 🏙️ Cellular vs Wi-Fi

| Feature         | Wi-Fi                        | Cellular                       |
|-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Ownership       | Private (home/office)        | Public (telco-managed)         |
| Range           | ~150 ft indoors              | Up to 5 miles per tower        |
| Access Method   | No SIM needed                | Needs SIM (Subscriber ID Module) |
| Use Case        | Local LAN                    | Global network coverage        |

## 📶 Cellular Generations Overview

| Generation | Tech Focus         | Speed (Real-World)  | Notes                                 |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 2G         | Voice + SMS        | Kbps                 | Early digital, poor data performance   |
| 3G         | Web + multimedia   | ~1 Mbps              | First real internet on mobile         |
| 4G/LTE     | Broadband internet | 20–90 Mbps typical   | Foundation of modern mobile networks  |
| 5G         | Ultra high-speed   | 50–300 Mbps typical  | High density, low latency, mmWave     |

## 🚀 4G / LTE (Long Term Evolution)

- **Max Theoretical Speed**: 150 Mbps
- **Real-world**: ~20 Mbps
- **LTE-A (Advanced)**:
  - Max: 300 Mbps
  - Real-world: ~90 Mbps
- Supports voice, video, mobile broadband

✅ Reliable  
❌ Slower than specs suggest

## ⚡ 5G (Fifth Generation)

### Frequency Ranges:
| Type       | Bandwidth      | Behavior                        |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Low Band   | ~900–1900 MHz  | ✅ Long range, good penetration |
| Mid Band   | 2–6 GHz        | ⚖️ Balance of speed & coverage |
| High Band  | 24–40 GHz (mmWave) | 🚀 Very fast, ❌ poor penetration |
