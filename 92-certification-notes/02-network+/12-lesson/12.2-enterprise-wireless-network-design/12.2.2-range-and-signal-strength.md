## 12.2.2 – Range and Signal Strength

### 🧱 Typical Indoor Range

- A Wi-Fi device should reach **at least 30 meters (≈100 feet)** indoors.
- Outdoor range = **2–3× more**, depending on environment.
- **2.4 GHz** = longer range, better penetration.
- **5 GHz / 6 GHz** = shorter range, higher throughput.

> 📡 Lower frequencies go farther—like a bass guitar you can hear through walls.

---

### 🧱 Dynamic Rate Selection (DRS)

- Wi-Fi stations adjust speed based on **signal quality**.
  - Strong signal → high data rate
  - Weak signal → reduced data rate

> 🧠 DRS is like **autoshifting gears** in a car depending on the slope.

### 🧱 Obstruction and Interference

- **Signals pass through walls**, but...
  - Weakened by **brick, drywall**
  - **Blocked** by metal, concrete
- **Other interference sources**:
  - Fluorescent lights
  - Microwaves
  - Cordless phones
  - Industrial equipment (motors, machinery)
- **Bluetooth** shares 2.4 GHz band, but uses different modulation (usually non-interfering).

### 🧱 Measuring Signal Strength

- **Unit: dBm (decibel-milliwatts)**
  - 0 dBm = 1 mW
  - -30 dBm = strong signal (~perfect)
  - -60 to -70 dBm = usable
  - -80 dBm or worse = bad (packet loss likely)

#### 💡 Example Math:
```
0 dBm + 3 dB ≈ 2 mW ≈ 3 dBm
```

> 📏 dBm measures power **logarithmically**. Each +3 dB ≈ doubling of power.

### 🧱 RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)

- Measures signal **at the receiver (client)**.
- Usually in **negative dBm** values:
  - **-30 dBm** = ideal
  - **-65 dBm** = acceptable
  - **< -80 dBm** = unreliable
- Must exceed the **minimum receiver sensitivity**.

> 📶 RSSI is what powers the “bars” on your Wi-Fi signal icon.

> ℹ️ **Vendors vary**:
  - May show RSSI as raw index (e.g., 0–60, 0–127, or 0–255)
  - Converted to signal bars on devices

### 🧱 SNR – Signal-to-Noise Ratio

- Measures signal vs. background noise:
```
SNR = Signal (dBm) - Noise (dBm)
```

- Higher SNR = better!
  - Signal: -65 dBm
  - Noise: -90 dBm
  - SNR: **25 dB** ✅ good
- If noise is -80 dBm, SNR = **15 dB** ❌ poor connection

> 🎧 Think of SNR like a conversation in a noisy room: louder voice, or less background noise = easier to hear.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **dBm** | Signal strength in decibels over 1 mW |
| **RSSI** | Measured signal at client device |
| **SNR** | Signal strength minus noise floor |
| **DRS** | Dynamically adjusts data rate to signal quality |
