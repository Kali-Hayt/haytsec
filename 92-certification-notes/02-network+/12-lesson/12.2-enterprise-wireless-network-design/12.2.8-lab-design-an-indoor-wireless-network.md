### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Design a functional indoor wireless network using **only 3 WAPs** while:
- Ensuring **full coverage**
- Minimizing **signal leakage** (emanation)
- Using **proper antenna types** for each location

### ðŸ§  Solution Breakdown

| Area                          | AP Type            | Reasoning |
|------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Lobby**                    | Omnidirectional    | Central location with open spaceâ€”needs 360Â° coverage |
| **West wall â€“ IT Admin Office** | Directional         | Wall-mounted to cover office interior without leaking outside |
| **East wall â€“ Networking Closet** | Directional      | Aimed inward to prevent unnecessary broadcast into hallway or outside |

---

### âœ… Lab Instructions Followed

1. Selected **Wireless Access Point (Indoor, omnidirectional Antenna)** for the **Lobby**
2. Installed **Wireless Access Point (Indoor, directional Antenna)** on **west wall of IT Admin**
3. Installed **Wireless Access Point (Indoor, directional Antenna)** on **east wall of Networking Closet**

---

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- **Omnidirectional** = best for open or central spaces
- **Directional** = ideal for perimeters, minimizing bleed
- Efficient placement = fewer APs, better security, less interference
