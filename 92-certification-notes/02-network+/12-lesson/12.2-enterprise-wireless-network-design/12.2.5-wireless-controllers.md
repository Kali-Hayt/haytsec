## 12.2.5 – Wireless Controllers

### 🧱 Problem with Managing Many APs

- Enterprise networks may use **dozens or hundreds of APs**.
- Managing each AP manually:
  - Wastes time
  - Increases risk of config errors
  - Makes it hard to monitor client usage and traffic distribution

> ❌ Manual AP management = chaos at scale.

---

### 🧱 Wireless Controller: Centralized Management

- A **wireless controller** is a hardware device that:
  - Configures APs automatically
  - Monitors performance, signal, and client connections
  - Coordinates SSIDs, channels, security, VLANs, etc.

> 🧠 Think of the controller as the **brain**, and the APs as the **arms and ears**.

### 🧱 AP Types: Autonomous vs Lightweight

| AP Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Autonomous AP** | Full-featured, works standalone, no controller needed |
| **Lightweight AP** | Relies on a wireless controller to function properly |

---

### 🧱 Communication Protocols

- **LWAPP (Lightweight Access Point Protocol)**:
  - Cisco standard
  - Used by wireless controllers to push configs to APs
- **CAPWAP (Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points)**:
  - Newer IETF standard, broader vendor support
- **Proprietary protocols** may exist, depending on vendor

---

### 🧱 Controller Features

- Autoconfigures APs:
  - SSID
  - Channel
  - Security
  - Standards mode
- Tracks which clients are connected where
- Centralizes **routing and switching** between:
  - WLAN (wireless)
  - LAN (wired)

---

### 🧱 VLAN Management

- Controller can assign clients to **separate VLANs**
- Supports **VLAN pooling**:
  - Spreads stations across VLANs
  - Reduces excessive broadcast traffic
  - Keeps station count per VLAN within limits

> 📦 Think of VLAN pooling like **load balancing clients** across multiple lanes to reduce collisions.

### ✅ Summary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Wireless Controller** | Central device that manages multiple APs |
| **Autonomous AP** | Works independently (no controller needed) |
| **Lightweight AP** | Requires controller to operate |
| **LWAPP** | Cisco protocol to manage lightweight APs |
| **CAPWAP** | Standardized protocol for AP-controller comms |
| **VLAN Pooling** | Load balances clients across VLANs |
