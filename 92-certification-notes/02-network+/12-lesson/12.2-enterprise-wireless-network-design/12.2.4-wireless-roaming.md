## 12.2.4 – Wireless Roaming

### 🧱 What Is Wireless Roaming?

- Roaming lets a client move between APs within an **Extended Service Area (ESA)**.
- Requires:
  - Same **ESSID**
  - Same **security config**
  - **Distribution System (DS)** linking APs via wired LAN

> 🧠 Think of roaming like walking around a mall while staying on the same call—your phone switches towers (APs) without dropping the call.

---

### 🧱 Roaming Behavior

- APs use **different channels** to avoid interference in overlapping BSAs.
- When signal weakens, client:
  - Searches for stronger AP with same ESSID
  - **Disassociates** from old AP
  - **Reassociates** with new one

#### Reauthentication:
- Depends on the protocol:
  - 🔐 Some clients must reauthenticate
  - ⚡ 802.11r enables **fast roaming** using cached credentials

---

### 🧱 Roaming Challenges

- Not always seamless—can cause:
  - **Timeouts** in apps
  - Interruptions in voice/video calls
- Clients use **roaming aggressiveness settings**:
  - Too aggressive → “flapping” between APs
  - Too lazy → stays with weak AP despite stronger options

> 🎛️ Tuning roaming settings is key to balancing **stability vs performance**.

## 🧱 SSID Broadcast and Beacon Frame

### 📡 Beacon Frame

- APs **broadcast** beacon frames to advertise the network.
  - Includes:
    - SSID/ESSID (if enabled)
    - BSSID
    - Data rates, encryption settings, more
- Default **beacon interval** = 100 ms
  - Can be increased to reduce traffic (but affects roaming responsiveness)

#### Hidden SSIDs:
- If SSID broadcast is disabled:
  - Clients must **manually configure** connection
  - Still discoverable with sniffers (🕵️)

> 🔍 **Hidden SSIDs are not secure.** Beacon frame may be hidden, but clients still reveal it during connection attempts.

## 🧱 Wireless Distribution System (WDS)

### 🌐 What is WDS?

- WDS = **wireless-only bridging** between APs
- Used when no Ethernet cabling is available

### 🔧 Configuration:

- All WDS APs must use:
  - Same **SSID**
  - Same **channel**
  - Same **security**
- AP roles:
  - **Base station** = connected to LAN
  - **Remote stations** = wirelessly bridge to base and serve clients
- Remote stations must **not** be wired

#### ⚠️ Caveat:
> Implementation varies by vendor—best to use matching AP brands.

### ✅ Quick Recap Table

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Roaming** | Seamless transition between APs in same ESA |
| **ESSID** | Must be same for roaming to work |
| **DS** | Wired backbone connecting APs |
| **Beacon Frame** | AP broadcast containing SSID, BSSID, data rates |
| **802.11r** | Fast roaming protocol |
| **WDS** | Wireless AP bridging without cables |
