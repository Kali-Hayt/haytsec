## 12.2.3 – Wireless Surveys and Heat Maps

### 🧱 Why Wireless Surveys Matter

Designing wireless networks involves more than range:
- Must account for:
  - Interference
  - Signal strength
  - **Device density** (how many devices per area)
  - **Mobility** (how much users move)
  - Special needs (e.g., **VoIP**, **video calls**)

> 📋 A **wireless survey** ensures the WLAN supports the expected number of users at acceptable data rates, **everywhere** it's needed.

### 🧱 BSA vs ESA

- **Basic Service Area (BSA)** = area covered by **a single AP**.
- **Extended Service Area (ESA)** = combined area of **multiple APs** sharing the same ESSID.

> 🧠 Think: BSA = one room; ESA = building-wide roaming on the same Wi-Fi name.

### 🧱 Survey Process – Step-by-Step

1. **Review Floor Plans**
   - Look for interference sources (e.g., elevators, concrete walls, metal shelving).
   - Identify places needing access and available **ports**.
   - 🔌 If using **PoE**, ensure switch ports support powering the APs.

2. **Create a Placement Plan**
   - Mark:
     - AP positions
     - Boosters or antennas
     - Boundaries of BSAs
   - Avoid:
     - Dead zones (low coverage)
     - Overlap that causes interference

3. **Test and Measure**
   - Place AP.
   - Use **survey tool** (e.g., on a laptop) to:
     - Record **signal strength**
     - Record **data rates** throughout the BSA

---

### 🧱 Heat Maps

- Tools visualize coverage as a **color-coded map**:
  - 🟢 Green = strong signal
  - 🟡 Yellow = warning
  - 🔴 Orange/Red = weak signal / drop-off zones

> 🔍 Think of it like a **thermal scan** for your Wi-Fi: green is healthy, red is trouble.

- Helps identify:
  - Where to reposition APs
  - Where to adjust **transmit power**
  - Where to avoid overlap

---

### 🧱 Channel Planning

- Neighboring APs must use **non-overlapping channels** (especially in 2.4 GHz).
- Prevents APs from **interfering** with each other.

---

### 🧱 Transmit Power Tuning

- APs can be **overpowered** if not adjusted.
- Adjust transmit power so the **BSA is the right size**.
  - Too strong → overlaps and interference
  - Too weak → dead zones

> 🎛️ Transmit Power = the volume knob on your AP.
