# QUESTION 1  
Which protocol is typically used by Cisco wireless controllers to communicate with access points?

❌ SNMP  
❌ HTTP  
❌ FTP  
✅ LWAPP  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **SNMP** is used for monitoring and managing devices, not for controller-AP communication.  
- ❌ **HTTP** is a web protocol used for accessing management interfaces, not AP control.  
- ❌ **FTP** is used for file transfers, like firmware updates, not AP management traffic.

# QUESTION 2  
What is the effect of suppressing SSID broadcast in a WLAN?

❌ It automatically encrypts all data transmissions.  
❌ It increases the beacon frame broadcast interval.  
✅ It requires users to manually configure the network connection.  
❌ It makes the network invisible to all client devices.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Automatically encrypting data** is handled by WPA/WPA2, not SSID broadcast settings.  
- ❌ **Beacon frame intervals** stay the same; the SSID is simply omitted, not delayed.  
- ❌ **Invisible to all clients** is a myth — devices with prior knowledge or passive scanners can still detect the SSID.

# QUESTION 3

Why should access points with omnidirectional antennas ideally be ceiling-mounted?

❌ To focus the signal in a single direction  
❌ To reduce signal strength  
✅ To minimize interference from furniture  
❌ To increase the frequency of the radio waves  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To focus the signal in a single direction**: That describes a *directional* antenna, not an omnidirectional one. Omnidirectional antennas spread the signal evenly in a horizontal plane.
- ❌ **To reduce signal strength**: That would be counterproductive—signal strength is cru

# QUESTION 4

How can multiple APs connected to the same distribution system be described?

❌ As an Ad-hoc Network  
❌ As a Mesh Network  
❌ As a Peer-to-Peer Network  
✅ As an Extended Service Set (ESS)  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **As an Ad-hoc Network**: That’s a decentralized, peer-based setup with no APs—just clients talking directly to each other.
- ❌ **As a Mesh Network**: Mesh involves APs wirelessly forwarding data to each other, often without a centralized distribution system.
- ❌ **As a Peer-to-Peer Network**: This term applies more to file sharing or network architecture without servers, not AP configurations.

# QUESTION 5

Which of the following best represents a good signal strength?

❌ -80 dBm  
❌ -50 dBm  
❌ -30 dBm  
✅ -65 dBm  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **-80 dBm**: Too weak for reliable connectivity—expect dropped packets and degraded performance.
- ❌ **-50 dBm**: Strong, but the question asks for *good*, not *strongest*. This is usually overkill.
- ❌ **-30 dBm**: Nearly perfect signal—useful in lab conditions, not realistic or necessary for general Wi-Fi.

🧠 -65 dBm hits the sweet spot: strong enough for stability, but not so powerful it's unrealistic. Ideal for daily use in homes, offices, and cafés.

# QUESTION 6

Which network type is most commonly used in Wi-Fi setups?

❌ Ad-hoc network  
✅ Infrastructure network  
❌ Peer-to-peer network  
❌ Mesh network  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Ad-hoc network**: Temporary, device-to-device. No access point involved—rarely used outside of niche cases or testing.
- ❌ **Peer-to-peer network**: Usually refers to file sharing or non-centralized LANs. Not relevant to typical Wi-Fi setups.
- ❌ **Mesh network**: Becoming more common in homes and businesses, but still not the **most** commonly used compared to traditional AP-based setups.

🧱 Infrastructure networks = clients connect to a centralized access point. That’s your everyday Wi-Fi.

# QUESTION 7

What mechanism do stations use to determine an appropriate data rate based on signal quality?

❌ Fixed Rate Selection  
❌ Adaptive Frequency Selection  
❌ Signal Quality Assessment  
✅ Dynamic Rate Switching/Selection (DRS)  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Fixed Rate Selection**: Opposite of what the question asks. This sets one constant data rate regardless of signal—inefficient.
- ❌ **Adaptive Frequency Selection**: That's used to avoid interference by changing frequency channels, not adjusting data rate.
- ❌ **Signal Quality Assessment**: A vague term, not a specific Wi-Fi mechanism. Stations assess quality, but that alone doesn’t define the rate.

🧠 DRS adjusts the data rate **dynamically** based on real-time link conditions. Poor signal? Drop the rate. Good signal? Crank it up.

# QUESTION 8

What does the beamwidth of an antenna indicate?

✅ The amount of directionality  
❌ The amount of electrical resistance  
❌ The power of the transmitted signal  
❌ The frequency of the transmitted signal  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **The amount of electrical resistance**: That refers to impedance, not beamwidth. Beamwidth is about signal spread, not opposition to current.
- ❌ **The power of the transmitted signal**: Power is measured in dBm or milliwatts—not beamwidth.
- ❌ **The frequency of the transmitted signal**: Frequency is set by the radio or standard (e.g., 2.4 GHz), not the antenna’s beamwidth.

🧠 Beamwidth = how wide the signal spreads. Narrow beam → more focused; wide beam → more coverage but less intensity.

# QUESTION 9

You have decided to conduct a business meeting at a local coffee shop. The coffee shop you chose has a wireless hotspot for customers who want internet access.

You decide to check your email before the meeting begins. When you open the browser, you cannot gain internet access. Other customers are using the Internet without problems. You're sure that your laptop's wireless adapter works because you use a wireless connection at work.

What is the MOST likely cause of the problem?

✅ A mismatched SSID  
❌ Incorrectly configured PPP  
❌ Different LAN protocols  
❌ An out-of-range WAP  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Incorrectly configured PPP**: PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) is used more in dial-up or VPN contexts—not typical in modern Wi-Fi.
- ❌ **Different LAN protocols**: Irrelevant here—Wi-Fi is standardized under 802.11. LAN protocol mismatches would not block access like this.
- ❌ **An out-of-range WAP**: You can’t connect at all if you’re out of range. The scenario suggests you're *connected*, just not getting access.

🧠 Most likely: you're connected to the wrong network (wrong SSID), possibly a nearby rogue or secured AP with no internet.

# QUESTION 10

What is the role of a beacon frame in a WLAN?

❌ To encrypt data transmissions between the AP and client devices  
✅ To advertise the WLAN  
❌ To suppress the SSID broadcast  
❌ To directly connect client devices to the Internet  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To encrypt data transmissions between the AP and client devices**: That’s handled by WPA2/WPA3 encryption mechanisms, not beacon frames.
- ❌ **To suppress the SSID broadcast**: You suppress the SSID by disabling broadcasting, but beacon frames still exist (they just don't include the SSID).
- ❌ **To directly connect client devices to the Internet**: Beacon frames don’t handle connections or routing—they’re purely for *announcing* the presence of the wireless network.

🧠 Beacon frames = AP's way of shouting “Hey! I exist! Here’s my SSID and supported data rates!”

# QUESTION 11

What is a heat map in the context of a wireless survey?

❌ A graphical representation of temperature variations in the area  
❌ A security tool to detect unauthorized access  
❌ A map showing the locations of heating vents in relation to APs  
✅ A graphical representation of signal strength across an area  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **A graphical representation of temperature variations in the area**: That’s thermal imaging, not related to wireless surveys.
- ❌ **A security tool to detect unauthorized access**: Wireless heat maps are not security tools—they help with performance and coverage planning.
- ❌ **A map showing the locations of heating vents in relation to APs**: Creative but not even close. Heating systems don’t appear in wireless heat maps.

🧠 Heat maps show **signal strength visually**, with colors representing strong (green) to weak (red) signal zones.

# QUESTION 12

What is the role of Wi-Fi Direct in wireless networking?

❌ To provide a scalable solution for large enterprise networks  
❌ To enable devices to connect to the Internet without a wireless adapter  
❌ To replace the need for wired connections in all types of network topologies  
✅ To allow devices to operate a limited type of access point for direct connections  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To provide a scalable solution for large enterprise networks**: Wi-Fi Direct isn’t enterprise-grade—it’s peer-to-peer, not scalable.
- ❌ **To enable devices to connect to the Internet without a wireless adapter**: A wireless adapter is still needed—this isn’t some kind of bypass magic.
- ❌ **To replace the need for wired connections in all types of network topologies**: Too broad. Wi-Fi Direct only replaces direct cables between two devices, not entire topologies.

🧠 Wi-Fi Direct = “soft” access point mode. Devices talk directly without a full infrastructure network—think printer-to-laptop or phone-to-TV.

# QUESTION 13

What is the purpose of creating a new plan with marked basic service areas and associated APs during a wireless survey?

❌ To facilitate easy maintenance  
❌ To minimize the cost of equipment  
✅ To avoid "dead zones" and ensure adequate coverage  
❌ To ensure a visually appealing layout  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To facilitate easy maintenance**: While documentation helps with maintenance, that’s not the

# QUESTION 14

What is the primary purpose of a wireless point-to-point link?

❌ To connect multiple devices in a network without using cables  
❌ To replace all wired connections in an office environment  
❌ To create a scalable network for large enterprise implementations  
✅ To establish a logical and physical connection between two devices  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To connect multiple devices in a network without using cables**: That’s more like a point-to-multipoint or infrastructure mode—not true point-to-point.
- ❌ **To replace all wired connections in an office environment**: Overkill. Point-to-point is for linking *two locations*, not internal office setups.
- ❌ **To create a scalable network for large enterprise implementations**: Point-to-point isn’t scalable; it’s direct and dedicated, not flexible.

🧠 Point-to-point links are like laser beams—one endpoint to another. Ideal for connecting two buildings across a street or campus.

# QUESTION 15

What advantage does automated VLAN pooling provide in a wireless network?

❌ Reduces the cost of deploying access points  
❌ Enhances the physical security of the network infrastructure  
✅ Reduces excessive broadcast traffic  
❌ Increases the signal strength of access points  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Reduces the cost of deploying access points**: VLAN pooling doesn’t affect AP hardware costs—it’s a logical network segmentation feature.
- ❌ **Enhances the physical security of the network infrastructure**: VLANs are about logical separation, not physical protection.
- ❌ **Increases the signal strength of access points**: VLAN pooling has zero impact on RF signal strength—it’s purely about traffic segmentation.

🧠 Automated VLAN pooling = clients get split across VLANs dynamically, helping to **minimize broadcast domain size** and reduce traffic congestion.
