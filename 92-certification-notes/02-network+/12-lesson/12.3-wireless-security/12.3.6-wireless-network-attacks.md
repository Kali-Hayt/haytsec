## 12.3.6 – Wireless Network Attacks

### 🎯 Why Wireless Is Vulnerable
- Wireless traffic is broadcast over the air
- Makes it easier for threat actors to intercept, spoof, or inject traffic
- Several attacks exploit wireless weaknesses, especially in authentication and access

---

### 🚨 Rogue Access Points

- A **rogue AP** is an unauthorized wireless access point on the network
- Can be:
  - Malicious (e.g., attacker device)
  - Accidental (e.g., user tethering a phone)
- Connected to LAN = potential **backdoor** for attackers

#### 🛡 Prevention
- Use **EAP-TLS** for strong authentication
- Deploy **WIDS/WIPS**:
  - Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems
  - Monitor for unknown or misconfigured APs

---

### 😈 Evil Twin Attacks

- A rogue AP **masquerading as a legitimate AP**
- Tricks users into connecting by:
  - Using a lookalike **SSID** (e.g., "compeny" instead of "company")
  - Spoofing **BSSID** (MAC address)
  - Launching DoS against the real AP to force disconnects
- Once users reconnect, they may:
  - Enter credentials
  - Transmit data that the attacker can sniff

#### Attack Capabilities
- **On-path interception** (MITM)
- Credential harvesting
- Session hijacking

---

### ❌ Deauthentication Attacks

- Attacker sends **spoofed deauth frames** to disconnect clients
- Often used with **evil twins**
- Goal:
  - Force reconnection to rogue AP
  - Interfere with user sessions
  - Disrupt the wireless network (**DoS**)

#### 🛡 Defense
- Use **Management Frame Protection (MFP / 802.11w)**
- Requires both AP **and** clients to support it

> 🧠 These attacks often go undetected in unsecured or poorly monitored environments. Always enable WPA3, MFP, and WIDS/WIPS where possible.
