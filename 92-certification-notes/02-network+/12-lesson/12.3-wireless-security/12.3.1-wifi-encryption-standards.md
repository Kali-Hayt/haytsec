## 12.3.1 – Wi-Fi Encryption Standards

### 🧱 Why Wi-Fi Needs Encryption
- Wireless networks broadcast data openly—without encryption, anyone nearby can sniff it.
- Security settings depend on:
  - Device support for encryption standards
  - Type of authentication system
  - Purpose of the network
- Standards define:
  - 🔐 Cryptographic protocols used
  - 🔑 Key generation methods
  - 🛂 Methods for authenticating clients

---

### ❌ WEP – Wired Equivalent Privacy
- First Wi-Fi security protocol
- Used **RC4** stream cipher
- Weaknesses:
  - Predictable keys
  - Easy to crack via packet sniffing
  - Vulnerable to **replay** and **key recovery** attacks

---

### ⚠️ WPA – Wi-Fi Protected Access (v1)
- Patch for WEP vulnerabilities
- Still uses **RC4**, but adds:
  - 🧱 **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)**
- TKIP improves key management but...
  - Still vulnerable to replay and injection attacks
  - No longer considered secure

---

### ✅ WPA2 – Advanced Encryption
- Replaces RC4 with **AES**
- Replaces TKIP with:
  - 🧱 **CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol)**
- CCMP = authenticated encryption → harder to spoof or replay

---

### ✅ WPA3 – The Modern Standard

#### 🔐 Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
- Replaces WPA2-PSK
- Uses a **4-way handshake** with stronger cryptography
- Resistant to **offline dictionary attacks**

#### 🧱 Updated Cryptographic Protocols
- Replaces AES-CCMP with:
  - ✅ **AES-GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol)**
- Offers better performance and security

#### 🛡 Protected Management Frames
- Management frames = join/disconnect notifications
- WPA and WPA2 allowed spoofing
- WPA3 **encrypts** these to prevent:
  - Key recovery attacks
  - Forced disconnections (DoS)

#### 🌐 Wi-Fi Enhanced Open
- Open Wi-Fi (no passphrase) still encrypts traffic
- WPA2 leaves open networks unprotected
- WPA3 protects even open traffic from sniffing

### 🔍 Summary: Protocol Evolution

| Standard | Cipher | Integrity | Key Mgmt | Secure? |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| WEP      | RC4    | CRC-32    | Static   | ❌      |
| WPA      | RC4    | TKIP      | TKIP     | ❌      |
| WPA2     | AES    | CCMP      | 4-Way    | ✅*     |
| WPA3     | AES    | GCMP      | SAE      | ✅✅✅   |

> *WPA2 is secure if properly configured, but vulnerable to offline key cracking if weak passwords are used.
