# QUESTION 1

What is one solution to mitigate the risk of rogue access points?

❌ Decreasing the signal strength of the legitimate access points  
❌ Increasing the network's bandwidth  
❌ Disabling the network's SSID broadcast  
✅ Using EAP-TLS security for mutual authentication

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Decreasing signal strength* might reduce accidental leakage but does **not stop rogue APs** from imitating legitimate ones.
- ❌ *Increasing bandwidth* improves performance, not **security**—doesn't help with rogue AP threats.
- ❌ *Disabling SSID broadcast* only hides the network from casual users; rogue APs can still broadcast **spoofed SSIDs**.

# QUESTION 2

In WPA2, what is generated using the passphrase in PSK authentication?

❌ SAE protocol  
❌ Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)  
✅ Pairwise master key (PMK)  
❌ 4-way handshake  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *SAE protocol* is used in WPA3, not WPA2. It replaces PSK in WPA3 for better security.
- ❌ *PAKE* is the category SAE belongs to. Again—relevant to WPA3, not WPA2-PSK.
- ❌ *4-way handshake* is what **uses** the PMK to derive session keys—it’s not generated **from** the passphrase.

# QUESTION 3

Which of the following attacks aim to recover the encryption key in WEP and original WPA versions?

❌ Cross-site scripting attacks  
❌ Phishing attacks  
✅ Replay attacks  
❌ SQL injection attacks  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Cross-site scripting (XSS)* targets web applications, not wireless protocols.
- ❌ *Phishing* tricks users into revealing credentials—it doesn't target WEP/WPA encryption itself.
- ✅ *Replay attacks* are used in cracking WEP/WPA by capturing and replaying authentication packets to recover encryption keys.
- ❌ *SQL injection* affects databases and is irrelevant to wireless encryption.

# QUESTION 4

Which of the following BEST describes the method an attacker might use to make an evil twin access point more appealing to unsuspecting users?

❌ Decreasing the signal strength of the evil twin access point  
❌ Naming the evil twin access point with a completely unrelated SSID  
❌ Encrypting the connection to the evil twin access point with an outdated encryption method  
✅ Configuring the evil twin access point with a similar or identical SSID to a legitimate access point  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Decreasing signal strength makes the rogue AP less attractive, not more.
- ❌ Unrelated SSID won't trick users into connecting—users trust familiar names.
- ❌ Outdated encryption might lower security, but it doesn’t attract victims.
- ✅ Identical SSIDs (and sometimes matching MACs) trick users into connecting automatically. Classic evil twin trap.

# QUESTION 5

What mechanism does WPA3 use to encrypt open authentication traffic?

❌ TLS Encryption  
❌ VPN Tunneling  
✅ Wi-Fi Enhanced Open  
❌ WPA2 Encryption  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **TLS Encryption**: That’s used in HTTPS and some EAP types, not in WPA3 open networks.
- ❌ **VPN Tunneling**: VPNs are separate from Wi-Fi standards entirely.
- ❌ **WPA2 Encryption**: WPA3 replaced WPA2 in many ways—using WPA2 doesn’t explain WPA3’s improvements.
- ✅ **Wi-Fi Enhanced Open** uses Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), part of WPA3, to encrypt open (no-password) traffic.

# QUESTION 6

What is an enterprise mobility management (EMM) suite primarily used for in a BYOD environment?

❌ To increase the variety of devices used in the corporate environment  
❌ To restrict personal use of corporate devices  
✅ To enforce security policies on connected devices  
❌ To prohibit the use of personal devices in the workplace  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To increase the variety of devices...**: That’s a side effect, not the purpose. EMM isn’t about quantity—it’s about control and security.
- ❌ **To restrict personal use of corporate devices**: EMM focuses more on mobile policy enforcement, not limiting user behavior on corporate hardware.
- ❌ **To prohibit the use of personal devices**: That would defeat BYOD entirely—EMM enables BYOD, not blocks it.
- ✅ **To enforce security policies on connected devices**: This is the core of EMM—device compliance, remote wipe, encryption enforcement, etc., especially in BYOD environments.

# QUESTION 7

Which methods are used to derive session keys in an enterprise authentication setup? (Select Two)

❌ SNMP community strings  
❌ DHCP lease negotiation  
✅ WPA3 SAE methods  
❌ IEEE 802.11ac beamforming  
✅ WPA2 four-way handshake  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **SNMP community strings**: These are used for network management access control, not cryptographic key exchange. Totally unrelated to session keys.
- ❌ **DHCP lease negotiation**: DHCP is about assigning IP addresses—not encryption, keys, or authentication sessions.
- ✅ **WPA3 SAE methods**: Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) is a password-based key exchange that securely derives session keys in WPA3.
- ❌ **IEEE 802.11ac beamforming**: Beamforming enhances signal direction—not security. It's a performance technique, not a key exchange mechanism.
- ✅ **WPA2 four-way handshake**: Critical process used after authentication to derive the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) for encryption of the session.

# QUESTION 8

What role does the access point (AP) play in enterprise authentication?

❌ It directly authenticates user credentials.  
❌ It serves as the authentication server.  
✅ It forwards authentication data to an AAA server.  
❌ It generates the master key (MK).  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It directly authenticates user credentials**: That's the job of the AAA server (like a RADIUS server), not the AP.
- ❌ **It serves as the authentication server**: Again, no. The AP is just a middleman—not the one making authentication decisions.
- ✅ **It forwards authentication data to an AAA server**: Correct. In enterprise setups (like WPA2-Enterprise), the AP relays credentials to a backend authentication system.
- ❌ **It generates the master key (MK)**: The master key is derived from the EAP exchange between the client and authentication server—not by the AP.

# QUESTION 9

What is the purpose of using a VPN with an open Wi-Fi network?

❌ To decrease the network's bandwidth usage  
❌ To allow unrestricted access to all network resources  
❌ To bypass the need for a captive portal  
✅ To create an encrypted tunnel for secure communication  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To decrease the network's bandwidth usage**: A VPN actually adds *more* overhead due to encryption—not less.
- ❌ **To allow unrestricted access to all network resources**: VPNs don’t unlock access—they just encrypt traffic between you and the VPN endpoint.
- ❌ **To bypass the need for a captive portal**: Captive portals often block all traffic until accepted. VPN doesn’t bypass them; you still need to log in.
- ✅ **To create an encrypted tunnel for secure communication**: That's the core purpose—especially on open Wi-Fi, where encryption is otherwise absent.

# QUESTION 10

What protocol does WPA introduce to mitigate attacks against WEP?

❌ CCMP  
❌ GCMP  
❌ AES  
✅ TKIP  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **CCMP**: Introduced with WPA2, not WPA. It relies on AES encryption.
- ❌ **GCMP**: This is used in WPA3, not WPA. GCMP is even newer than CCMP.
- ❌ **AES**: While WPA2 mandates AES, WPA (the original) still relied on RC4 but added TKIP as a fix.
- ✅ **TKIP**: Temporal Key Integrity Protocol was added in WPA to patch WEP’s flaws without requiring new hardware.
