## 12.3.3 – Enterprise Authentication

### 🧱 Why Enterprise Instead of Personal?
- Personal modes (PSK/SAE) have major drawbacks:
  - Same key shared by all users = no user-level accountability
  - Difficult to manage securely
  - Users might choose weak passphrases
- Enterprise mode solves this by using **individual credentials** + **centralized control**

### ✅ WPA Enterprise Authentication

#### 🔒 Key Protocols
- Uses **IEEE 802.1X** standard
- Authenticates via **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)**
  - Specifically: **EAP over Wireless (EAPoW)**
- Only authentication traffic is allowed until identity is verified

---

### ⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Wireless client (supplicant)** requests association with access point (AP)
2. AP opens channel for **EAPoW only**
3. AP forwards credentials to AAA server (e.g., **RADIUS** or **TACACS+**)
4. AAA server:
   - Authenticates user
   - Sends a **Master Key (MK)** to the supplicant
5. Supplicant and server derive:
   - 🧱 **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)** from MK
6. AAA server also sends the **PMK** to the AP
7. AP and client use the PMK to generate **session keys**
   - Using either:
     - WPA2’s **4-way handshake**
     - WPA3’s **SAE**

### 🏢 Enterprise Mode Summary

| Component         | Role                                                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Supplicant        | Wireless client requesting access                  |
| Authenticator     | Access point (AP), passes credentials              |
| Authentication Server | AAA server (e.g., RADIUS), validates credentials  |
| EAPoW             | Tunnel for authentication traffic only             |
| PMK               | Derived from MK, used for session encryption       |

> ✅ WPA2-Enterprise and WPA3-Enterprise modes must be selected on the access point to use this system.
