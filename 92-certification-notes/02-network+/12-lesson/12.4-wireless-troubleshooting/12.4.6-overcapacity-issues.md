## 12.4.6 – Overcapacity Issues

---

### 🚨 What is Overcapacity?

Overcapacity occurs when **too many client devices** are trying to use the same AP, overwhelming the wireless infrastructure.

- Causes **high latency**, **low throughput**, dropped connections, and **poor roaming behavior**.
- Common in public areas, lecture halls, stadiums, and event spaces.

---

### ⚠️ Symptoms of Overcapacity

- Clients **connect but can’t move data efficiently**
- Applications freeze or buffer (especially VoIP, video, cloud apps)
- Clients **fail to roam** due to high channel contention
- **Retries and retransmissions** flood the air, degrading performance for everyone

---

### 📉 Technical Causes

- **Wi-Fi is half-duplex** → only one device can transmit at a time on a channel
- **High client density** causes:
  - More **contention** for airtime
  - Increased **collisions**
  - **CSMA/CA** delays due to constant backoffs
- Access points hit **association limits**

---

### 🧠 Solutions to Overcapacity

- 📡 **Add more APs** — but carefully! Ensure proper **channel planning** and **power tuning**
- 📶 **Use both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands**
  - Spread the load
  - Encourage clients to roam to **less congested radios**
- 🏷️ **Load balancing**:
  - Use controller features to **limit number of clients per AP**
  - Encourage handoff to less-used APs
- 🚪 **Band steering**:
  - Encourage dual-band clients to use 5GHz over 2.4GHz
- 🔁 **Fast roaming** (802.11r) to reduce roaming disruption

---

## TL;DR Summary

- Too many clients = performance nosedive.
- Symptoms: lag, retries, roaming failures.
- Solution = more APs, better planning, band steering, load balancing, and fast roaming.
