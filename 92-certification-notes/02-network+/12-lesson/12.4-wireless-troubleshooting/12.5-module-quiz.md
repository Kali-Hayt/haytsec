# QUESTION 1
How can rogue access points create security risks?

✅ By providing an unauthorized backdoor to the network  
❌ By improving the network's overall performance  
❌ By increasing the network's signal strength  
❌ By encrypting data transmitted over the network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Improving performance sounds helpful, but rogue APs aren’t designed with optimization in mind—they bypass security.
- ❌ Signal strength isn’t the issue here; even a strong signal is dangerous if it’s unauthorized.
- ❌ Encryption protects data, not weakens it—rogue APs often *lack* proper encryption, which is part of the problem.

# QUESTION 2
What might unexpected client disassociations indicate if there is no roaming, interference, or standards support issue?

❌ A signal to upgrade the network equipment  
❌ A sign of excessive network traffic  
❌ A need for a firmware update  
✅ A potential malicious attack  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Network upgrades are long-term planning decisions—not sudden disassociation triggers.
- ❌ High network traffic may cause slowdowns, not sudden client drops unless it's *very* extreme.
- ❌ Firmware issues could cause weird behavior, but not consistent unexpected disassociations without other symptoms.

# QUESTION 3
Which protocol is defined for the use of EAP over Wireless?

❌ EAP-TLS  
❌ 802.1X  
✅ EAPoW  
❌ WPA2  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **EAP-TLS** is an authentication method used *within* EAP, not the protocol that defines EAP over wireless.
- ❌ **802.1X** is the port-based network access control framework used with EAP—but again, not specific to wireless.
- ❌ **WPA2** is a security standard that *uses* EAP (in enterprise mode), but doesn’t define EAP over Wi-Fi.

🧱 **EAPoW (EAP over Wireless)** is specifically defined for how EAP is transmitted over wireless LANs (802.11 networks).

# QUESTION 4  
What is the primary limitation of channel bonding in the 2.4 GHz band?

❌ It is not supported by IEEE 802.11n  
❌ It increases interference with other devices.  
✅ It is only practical in the 5 GHz band.  
❌ It reduces the data rate.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Not supported by IEEE 802.11n** – Channel bonding *is* supported in 802.11n; that’s part of what gives it higher throughput.
- ❌ **Increases interference** – While *true in effect*, this isn’t the **primary** limitation. The 2.4 GHz band only has 3 non-overlapping channels, making bonding impractical due to limited space.
- ❌ **Reduces data rate** – The whole point of bonding is to *increase* bandwidth, which boosts data rates, not lowers them.

🧱 **Key takeaway**: 2.4 GHz is too crowded and narrow for bonding to work well. 5 GHz has the elbow room to make it viable.

# QUESTION 5
What is the primary difference between Wi-Fi and cellular radio in terms of operation?

✅ Wi-Fi is operated by individual users, while cellular radio is operated by telecommunications providers.  
❌ Cellular radio is typically used for private infrastructure, whereas Wi-Fi is not.  
❌ Wi-Fi uses a broader radio spectrum compared to cellular radio.  
❌ Cellular radio has a shorter effective range than Wi-Fi.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Cellular networks** are almost always public infrastructure operated by large providers. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is used in homes and businesses by individuals or organizations.
- ❌ Cellular radio uses a much **broader and licensed** radio spectrum than Wi-Fi, which operates in narrow, unlicensed bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz).
- ❌ Cellular has a **longer effective range** due to higher power, towers, and optimized infrastructure. Wi-Fi is limited to local-area coverage.

🧱 The distinction lies in **ownership and operation**: Wi-Fi is user-managed, while cellular requires licensed spectrum and provider infrastructure.

# QUESTION 6
What is a deauthentication attack?

✅ An attack that disconnects clients from an AP  
❌ An attack that improves the authentication process  
❌ An attack that encrypts data packets to prevent interception  
❌ An attack that increases the signal strength of an access point  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Improving authentication is not an attack — it's a security measure.
- ❌ Encryption prevents interception, not a goal of attackers in this case — in fact, deauth attacks often **precede** interception (e.g., in WPA handshake capture).
- ❌ Boosting signal strength is not a malicious act by itself and isn’t relevant to client disconnections.

🧱 A deauthentication attack sends spoofed **deauth frames** to force clients off the network — commonly used in Wi-Fi hacking to capture handshakes or disrupt service (a denial-of-service method).

---
# QUESTION 7  
What does an access point use to mediate communications between client devices?

❌ A network switch  
✅ A specific frequency and channel  
❌ An IP address  
❌ A virtual MAC address  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Network switch** – That’s wired networking. APs don't use switches to coordinate wireless communication.
- ❌ **IP address** – IPs work at the network layer, but the access point mediates traffic at the radio layer first using frequencies/channels.
- ❌ **Virtual MAC address** – This can help with roaming or redundancy, but not with coordinating wireless transmission directly.

🧱 **Key concept**: An AP manages communication by assigning devices to specific RF channels and frequencies to reduce interference and control the wireless medium.

# QUESTION 8
A university is planning to upgrade its campus-wide Wi-Fi network to support a surge in online video lectures and virtual reality (VR) applications for educational purposes. The network needs to support high data rates and low latency for a seamless experience.

Considering the requirements, which Wi-Fi standard should the university implement?

✅ Wi-Fi 6, because it aims to approximate 10G connection speeds.  
❌ Wi-Fi 6, because it prioritizes voice over IP (VoIP) traffic.  
❌ Wi-Fi 5, because it supports channel bonding up to 160 MHz.  
❌ Wi-Fi 5, because it is designed to work in the 5 GHz band.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Wi-Fi 6 **doesn’t specifically prioritize VoIP** — it improves performance for *all traffic types* by reducing latency and increasing efficiency with technologies like OFDMA and MU-MIMO.
- ❌ Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) **does support channel bonding**, but it lacks Wi-Fi 6's efficiency in high-density environments and doesn’t provide the same throughput or low-latency features.
- ❌ While Wi-Fi 5 is 5 GHz-only, that’s not a compelling reason on its own, especially since Wi-Fi 6 supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz with better performance overall.

🧠 Bottom line: Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is designed for **high throughput and dense environments**, making it perfect for modern education use cases like VR and streaming.

# QUESTION 9
Why might you budget for a signal loss through internal walls?

✅ To account for potential signal degradation in indoor environments  
❌ To ensure the network operates below its maximum capacity  
❌ To reduce the cost of network installation  
❌ To comply with wireless network standards  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Operating below capacity** isn’t the reason — you budget for *physical obstructions*, not to artificially limit throughput.
- ❌ **Reducing cost** would mean placing *fewer* APs, which can worsen performance — the opposite of accounting for signal loss.
- ❌ **Wireless standards compliance** doesn’t mandate budgeting for wall loss; standards provide ranges, but *you* design for environment-specific factors.

🧱 Walls, floors, metal, and concrete act like signal vampires 🧛‍♂️— absorbing or reflecting RF energy. So in a real-world WLAN deployment, you budget signal loss into your coverage plan to **ensure consistent client connectivity throughout a building**.

# QUESTION 10
What is an autonomous AP?

✅ An AP that operates without a wireless controller  
❌ An AP that can only communicate using LWAPP  
❌ An AP that requires a wireless controller to function  
❌ An AP designed exclusively for home use  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **LWAPP** (Lightweight Access Point Protocol) is used by lightweight APs — not autonomous ones.
- ❌ **Requires a controller** is the opposite of autonomous. That describes *lightweight* APs, which offload control functions.
- ❌ **Home-use exclusivity** isn’t accurate. Autonomous APs can be used in small offices, labs, or even enterprise edge deployments.

🧱 Think of an autonomous AP like a **standalone router** — it’s self-sufficient. No need to phone home to a controller. It's the old-school, do-it-yourself type in a world full of cloud-managed hipsters.

# QUESTION 11
After conducting a wireless survey in a new office space, you decide to adjust the transmit power of the access points. The goal is to encourage devices to connect to the 5 GHz band instead of the 2.4 GHz band.  
What strategy should you employ?

✅ Lower the transmit power of the 2.4 GHz band  
❌ Use the same transmit power for both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands  
❌ Disable the 5 GHz band on all access points  
❌ Increase the transmit power of the 2.4 GHz band to its maximum  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Same power for both bands** keeps the 2.4 GHz signal range wider (since it naturally travels farther), so clients will still prefer it.
- ❌ **Disabling 5 GHz** does the opposite of the goal — you’re trying to *favor* 5 GHz, not eliminate it.
- ❌ **Increasing 2.4 GHz power** further boosts its range and signal strength, making it even more attractive to devices — opposite of the goal.

🧱 The trick is this: **2.4 GHz has longer range** by default, so to shift clients to 5 GHz, you *shrink* the 2.4 GHz footprint — that's why you **lower its power**.

# QUESTION 12
What is the primary purpose of conducting a wireless survey when designing a wireless network?

✅ To ensure the WLAN delivers acceptable data rates in all physical locations  
❌ To find the cheapest equipment for the network  
❌ To decide the number of users that can connect to the network  
❌ To determine the best color for the access points  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Cheapest equipment** has nothing to do with a wireless *survey*. That’s procurement, not RF planning.
- ❌ **Number of users** matters, but surveys are more about *coverage*, *signal strength*, and *data rates*, not headcount.
- ❌ **Color of APs** is just decorative — has zero effect on signal quality (unless the paint is made of lead, in which case... we have other problems).

🧱 A wireless site survey is your **RF map-making session**. You're plotting signal strength, identifying dead zones, and adjusting AP placement so users don’t drop Zoom calls in the back conference room.

# QUESTION 13
What vulnerability does the 4-way handshake in WPA2 have?

✅ It allows a threat actor to recover the key.  
❌ It does not support AES.  
❌ It is susceptible to DoS attacks.  
❌ It cannot encrypt traffic.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Does not support AES** – WPA2 *does* support AES. In fact, WPA2-Enterprise requires it. So this is flat wrong.
- ❌ **DoS attacks** – While possible, that's not the *notorious* flaw in the 4-way handshake. This distracts from the real issue.
- ❌ **Cannot encrypt traffic** – Absolutely false. WPA2 encrypts traffic using AES or TKIP (though TKIP is outdated and discouraged).

🧱 The actual flaw comes from the fact that the **4-way handshake can be captured and replayed**, which is how the **KRACK attack** works. It lets an attacker trick a client into reusing a key, ultimately enabling decryption of data — even if the attacker doesn’t know the passphrase. This is why **WPA3** fixed it with forward secrecy and individualized encryption.

# QUESTION 14
What does a 6 dB change in the level of a particular source indicate in terms of distance between the analyzer and the source of the RF source?

✅ It represents a halving or doubling of the distance.  
❌ It indicates a tenfold increase or decrease in distance.  
❌ It suggests a change in frequency, not distance.  
❌ It signifies that the distance has remained constant.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Tenfold increase/decrease** – That would be a **20 dB** change (10x power = 10 dB, but distance is trickier and nonlinear). A **6 dB change ≈ 2x**.
- ❌ **Change in frequency** – Decibels (dB) measure power or amplitude, not frequency. This is a complete misdirection.
- ❌ **Distance constant** – If the dB level changes, then *something* changed. If signal strength shifts by 6 dB, that directly implies distance has shifted (or obstacles have appeared).

🧱 In RF and Wi-Fi:
- A **6 dB increase** ≈ **half the distance** from the source.
- A **6 dB decrease** ≈ **double the distance** from the source.

This is rooted in the inverse square law and free space path loss. It's why power level tuning is crucial in Wi-Fi design — every dB matters!

# QUESTION 15
What is the primary goal of band steering?

✅ To make it more likely that a client will connect to the 5 GHz or 6 GHz band  
❌ To limit the number of devices that can connect to the network  
❌ To decrease the overall network speed  
❌ To increase the signal strength of all bands  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Limit number of devices** – Band steering doesn’t block devices; it influences *which band* they use, not how many connect.
- ❌ **Decrease speed** – Quite the opposite. Steering clients to less congested bands (like 5 GHz or 6 GHz) usually **improves speed and performance**.
- ❌ **Increase signal strength** – Band steering is about *behavioral control*, not signal amplification. Signal strength is hardware and configuration-based.

🧱 Band steering pushes dual-band or tri-band clients to use the **higher frequency bands** (5 GHz, 6 GHz) to:
- Avoid congestion on 2.4 GHz
- Improve throughput and performance
- Leverage wider channels in modern Wi-Fi

It’s smart load balancing, not brute force.

# QUESTION 16
You are setting up a remote office in a rural area where traditional broadband services are not available. You decide to use satellite Internet to ensure your team can stay connected.

Which type of satellite service should you consider to minimize latency for your team's video conferencing needs?

✅ Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite Internet access  
❌ Any satellite service as they all provide the same latency  
❌ Satellite services are not suitable for video conferencing due to high latency  
❌ High geostationary orbit satellite Internet access  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **All satellite services same latency** – False. Latency varies *greatly* based on satellite altitude.
- ❌ **Satellite services not suitable** – Outdated. Traditional GEO-based services were laggy, but **LEO providers like Starlink** changed the game.
- ❌ **High geostationary orbit** – GEO satellites sit ~35,786 km up. The **round-trip latency** can exceed **600ms**, making real-time communication a struggle.

🛰️ LEO satellites, by contrast, orbit at **500–2,000 km**, delivering **latency around 20–40ms** — closer to cable or fiber. Ideal for VoIP, video conferencing, and modern business needs.

# QUESTION 17  
What does refraction of radio waves typically cause?

✅ A decrease in data rate  
❌ An increase in signal strength  
❌ Improved signal stability  
❌ No change in signal behavior  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increase in signal strength** – Refraction bends waves, but it doesn’t amplify them. Signal strength usually **weakens** due to path changes or distortion.
- ❌ **Improved stability** – Quite the opposite. Refraction causes **unpredictable shifts**, making signal behavior less reliable and more prone to fluctuation.
- ❌ **No change in behavior** – Refraction *is* a change in behavior. It alters wave direction and can interfere with intended communication paths.

🔍 Refraction happens when a wave passes between **air layers of differing density** (like warm vs. cool air), bending the signal and potentially sending it off-course. This reduces clarity and **lowers throughput** — hence, decreased data rate.

# QUESTION 18  
You have a small business with a Wi-Fi network currently using WPA2 encryption. You have read about vulnerabilities in WPA2 and are considering an upgrade to enhance security. However, you are concerned about the compatibility of older devices.  
What should you consider in his decision to upgrade?

✅ Upgrading to WPA3 but providing a separate WPA2 network for older devices  
❌ Upgrading to WPA3 regardless of device compatibility  
❌ Reverting to WEP for maximum compatibility  
❌ Staying with WPA2 and accepting the risks  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Upgrade to WPA3 regardless** – That’s risky. Older clients that don’t support WPA3 will be locked out, potentially breaking business operations.
- ❌ **Revert to WEP** – That’s going *backward in time* into security hell. WEP is completely broken, deprecated, and should never be used.
- ❌ **Stay with WPA2 and accept risks** – That’s a defeatist attitude. It ignores the real, active vulnerabilities like KRACK.

✅ Dual SSID is the best compromise:  
- WPA3 for new, secure clients  
- Separate WPA2 SSID for legacy gear  
This offers layered protection without alienating legacy devices.

# QUESTION 19  
What does the beamwidth of an antenna indicate?

✅ The amount of directionality  
❌ The amount of electrical resistance  
❌ The power of the transmitted signal  
❌ The frequency of the transmitted signal  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Electrical resistance** – That’s an electrical property of circuits, not antennas’ coverage shape.
- ❌ **Transmitted power** – Power is measured in watts/milliwatts/dBm, not beamwidth. You can have a high-power signal in a wide or narrow beam.
- ❌ **Transmitted frequency** – Frequency (e.g., 2.4GHz or 5GHz) is unrelated to how wide or narrow the antenna’s radiation pattern is.

🧭 **Beamwidth** is the angle (usually in degrees) over which the majority of the antenna’s power is radiated. A narrow beamwidth = highly directional (like a laser pointer). A wide beamwidth = more coverage, less range.

---
# QUESTION 20  
Why might using a unidirectional antenna not be suitable for general client access?

✅ It is only suitable for point-to-point connections.  
❌ It reduces the need for access points.  
❌ It provides too strong a signal.  
❌ It increases the network's bandwidth.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Reduces the need for access points** – Actually, it can increase the need for APs since it only covers a narrow area.
- ❌ **Too strong a signal** – Unidirectional antennas focus signal in one direction, but power output isn’t inherently “too strong”; it’s about direction, not strength.
- ❌ **Increases bandwidth** – Beam direction doesn’t affect bandwidth. Bandwidth depends on the standard (Wi-Fi 5, 6, etc.) and channel width.

📡 **Unidirectional = like a flashlight beam** — perfect for point-to-point (e.g., building-to-building), but not for general coverage where clients are all around.
