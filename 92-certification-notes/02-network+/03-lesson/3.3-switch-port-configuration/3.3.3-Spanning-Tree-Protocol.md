## 3.3.3 – Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- Used in large networks with multiple switches in a **mesh or partial mesh topology**.
- Ensures **redundancy**: if one link fails, data reroutes through another.
- Ethernet lacks a "time to live" for frames, so without control, **loops** can occur from flooded/broadcast traffic.

---

### 🌲 What STP Does

- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** prevents loops by creating a hierarchy.
- Elects a **root bridge** (lowest ID = priority + MAC address).
- Switches form a tree structure and **block loops** by disabling select ports.

---

### 📦 STP Communication

- Switches exchange **Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)**.
- Each switch determines the **shortest path** to the root bridge.

---

### 🔁 Port Roles

- **Root Port (RP)**: Best path “up” toward root bridge  
- **Designated Port (DP)**: Best path “down” to forward traffic  
- **Blocking Port (BP)**: Prevents loops — traffic is **not forwarded**  
- STP also uses **Topology Change Notifications** to update port states when the network changes.

### 🏛️ Root Bridge Example (3-switch layout)

- Root bridge connects to **Bridge A** and **Bridge B** via **Designated Ports** (DP).
- **Bridge A** and **Bridge B**:
  - Each have **Root Ports (RP)** pointing back to root bridge.
  - Also connected to each other directly.

- To prevent a loop:
  - **Bridge A** forwards traffic directly to Bridge B.  
  - **Bridge B**’s link to A is **blocked (BP)**.  
  - Bridge B sends traffic to Bridge A **via the root bridge**.
