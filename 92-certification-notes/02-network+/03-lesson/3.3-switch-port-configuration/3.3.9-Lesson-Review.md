Which of the following are components of the 18-byte header in a standard Ethernet frame? (Select four.)

❌ ✅ Error checking field  
✅ Destination MAC address  
✅ Source MAC address  
❌ Frame sequence number  
❌ Payload size indicator  
✅ EtherType field  
❌ ✅ Preamble  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ ✅ **Error checking field**: This is the **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**, which is part of the **trailer**, *not* the header. It comes after the payload.

- ❌ **Frame sequence number**: Not part of standard Ethernet II frames. That's used in higher-level protocols like 802.11 or TCP sequencing.

- ❌ **Payload size indicator**: This appears in **IEEE 802.3** frames but not in **Ethernet II**, and even there it’s not part of the header. Ethernet II uses **EtherType** instead.

- ❌ ✅ **Preamble**: The preamble (7 bytes) plus the Start Frame Delimiter (1 byte) **precede** the header, but are **not part of** the 18-byte Ethernet header.

✅ Correct 18-byte Ethernet frame header components:
- **Destination MAC address** (6 bytes)  
- **Source MAC address** (6 bytes)  
- **EtherType field** (2 bytes)  
- **(Optionally VLAN tag)** (4 bytes, if present — making the header 22 bytes total)

🧱 Standard Ethernet II header = 14 bytes  
🧱 With optional VLAN tag (802.1Q) = 18 bytes

# QUESTION 3

What is the purpose of the detection phase in a PoE switch?

❌ To encrypt the data being transmitted to the device  
❌ To determine the optimal data transmission rate  
✅ To identify whether the connected device is PoE-enabled and determine its power consumption  
❌ To test the strength of the Ethernet cable  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To encrypt the data being transmitted to the device**: Encryption has *nothing* to do with PoE. PoE handles power delivery — encryption happens at higher layers (like TLS at Layer 7 or IPsec at Layer 3).

- ❌ **To determine the optimal data transmission rate**: That’s handled during link negotiation (auto-negotiation) — not during PoE detection. Detection is strictly about *power*, not bandwidth.

- ❌ **To test the strength of the Ethernet cable**: PoE does not assess cable "strength" — just whether the cable and device can support power delivery safely.

✅ **To identify whether the connected device is PoE-enabled and determine its power consumption**: Correct. During the detection phase, the switch sends a small voltage to see if a valid PD (Powered Device) is present, then classifies its power level before delivering full voltage.

# QUESTION 4

Which of the following is a multicast frame that contains spanning tree protocol information about switch ports that allows switches to exchange information?

❌ Bus  
✅ BPDU  
❌ DPs  
❌ Lowest ID  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Bus**: A bus is a network topology, not a type of multicast frame or message format.
- ❌ **DPs**: Designated Ports (DPs) are a **role** in STP, not actual frames. They help forward traffic, but they don’t *send* spanning tree info themselves.
- ❌ **Lowest ID**: Refers to how root bridge elections work in STP (based on Bridge ID), but again, this is a **selection criteria**, not a multicast frame.

✅ **BPDU** (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) is the correct answer. These are multicast frames used in the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to exchange information about bridge IDs, root path costs, and port roles between switches.

# QUESTION 5

Under what condition is link aggregation considered to provide full redundancy?

❌ When the business function depends on the full speed of the bonded link and one port fails  
❌ When only two network interfaces are combined  
❌ When all physical links in the aggregation are wireless connections  
✅ When the aggregated link's bandwidth matches the sum of all individual links  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **When the business function depends on the full speed...**: If full speed is *required* for business to function, and one link fails, then redundancy fails — because performance degrades. Full redundancy means the function *continues unaffected*, even with link failure.

- ❌ **When only two network interfaces are combined**: Just combining two interfaces doesn’t automatically mean you have full redundancy — if one fails, and there’s no proper failover config (LACP, hashing, etc.), the link may still drop traffic.

- ❌ **When all physical links in the aggregation are wireless connections**: Wireless is inherently more unstable and less reliable for aggregation. Most enterprise-grade link aggregation happens on wired interfaces.

✅ **When the aggregated link's bandwidth matches the sum of all individual links**: This means the system is distributing load and balancing properly — and redundancy is achieved because if one link goes down, the others pick up the slack without service interruption. That's textbook full redundancy.

# QUESTION 6

Which command is used to designate a switch as the primary root bridge in Spanning Tree Protocol?

✅ **spanning-tree root primary**  
❌ spanning-tree set root  
❌ spanning-tree primary root  
❌ spanning-tree root set primary  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **spanning-tree set root**: This is not a valid Cisco IOS command. It's syntactically incorrect.

- ❌ **spanning-tree primary root**: Close, but not the actual Cisco command format. The order matters in IOS.

- ❌ **spanning-tree root set primary**: Again, this is a made-up variation and not recognized by Cisco's CLI.

✅ **spanning-tree root primary** is the correct Cisco IOS command. It dynamically adjusts the switch’s bridge priority so it becomes the root bridge for that VLAN (usually by setting its priority lower than others).

# QUESTION 7

Which two IEEE standards are initially defined for Power over Ethernet (PoE) and later combined into the 802.3-2018 standard?

❌ 802.1Q and 802.1p  
❌ 802.3z and 802.3ab  
✅ 802.3af and 802.3at  
❌ 802.11ac and 802.11n  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **802.1Q and 802.1p**: These relate to VLAN tagging (802.1Q) and QoS/traffic prioritization (802.1p), not PoE.

- ❌ **802.3z and 802.3ab**: These define Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet over fiber/copper — no power delivery involved.

- ❌ **802.11ac and 802.11n**: Wireless LAN standards — totally unrelated to Power over Ethernet (wired standard).

✅ **802.3af** defines standard PoE (up to ~15.4W per port), and **802.3at** defines PoE+ (up to ~30W per port). Both were later rolled into the comprehensive **IEEE 802.3-2018** standard, which unified and updated Ethernet specifications.

# QUESTION 8

What improvement does Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) offer over the original 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol?

✅ Multiple states aggregated into single state  
❌ Outages lasting tens of seconds  
❌ Longer convergence times  
❌ Increased number of port states  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Outages lasting tens of seconds**: That’s actually a *problem* with legacy STP (802.1D), not an RSTP feature. RSTP dramatically reduces downtime.

- ❌ **Longer convergence times**: RSTP is designed specifically for **faster convergence**, not longer. Legacy STP could take up to 50 seconds — RSTP trims that down to seconds.

- ❌ **Increased number of port states**: RSTP actually **reduces** the number of port states. It collapses several transitional states from STP (like Listening and Learning) into a simplified model.

✅ **Multiple states aggregated into single state**: Correct. RSTP simplifies port roles and states, combining the old Listening and Learning states into a unified **Discarding** state, which improves clarity and speeds up the transition to forwarding.

# QUESTION 9

You manage a single subnet with three switches. The switches are connected to provide redundant paths between themselves.  
Which feature prevents switching loops and ensures that there is only a single active path between any two switches?

❌ Trunking  
❌ PoE  
✅ Spanning Tree Protocol  
❌ 802.1x  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Trunking**: Trunking allows multiple VLANs to travel over a single link between switches, but it doesn’t prevent loops. In fact, it can **amplify** loop issues if STP isn’t running.

- ❌ **PoE**: Power over Ethernet is strictly for delivering electrical power over Ethernet cabling. Zero effect on network topology or loop prevention.

- ❌ **802.1x**: That’s a port-based network access control protocol, mostly for user/device authentication. It doesn’t touch Layer 2 switching loops.

✅ **Spanning Tree Protocol**: Correct. STP (IEEE 802.1D) is specifically designed to detect and block redundant paths that could cause loops, ensuring only one active path exists between switches at any time.

# QUESTION 10

What is the primary purpose of link aggregation/NIC teaming?

❌ To decrease the network speed  
❌ To replace wireless connections with wired connections  
❌ To increase the cost of network infrastructure  
✅ To combine multiple network connections into a single logical connection  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **To decrease the network speed**: That’s the opposite of the goal. Link aggregation is used to *increase* bandwidth and redundancy.

- ❌ **To replace wireless connections with wired connections**: Link aggregation is independent of the medium type and isn’t meant as a wireless replacement strategy.

- ❌ **To increase the cost of network infrastructure**: That's a side effect, not a purpose. If anything, it helps optimize existing hardware by bonding multiple interfaces.

✅ **To combine multiple network connections into a single logical connection**: Correct. This is exactly what link aggregation (also called NIC teaming or bonding) does — it boosts bandwidth, enhances fault tolerance, and presents multiple physical links as one logical interface to the OS or switch.

# QUESTION 12

What happens if both sides of a link aggregation are set to passive mode?

❌ The physical links are disabled.  
✅ No bonded channel is created.  
❌ A bonded channel is created with increased latency.  
❌ A bonded channel is created with reduced bandwidth.  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **The physical links are disabled**: Nope — the physical interfaces still function individually. They're just not *logically* bonded into an aggregated link.

- ❌ **A bonded channel is created with increased latency**: Incorrect — no channel is created at all in this case, so there's no impact on latency *because there's no aggregation*.

- ❌ **A bonded channel is created with reduced bandwidth**: Same issue — no channel = no bonding = no shared bandwidth to reduce.

✅ **No bonded channel is created**: Correct. In LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol), **passive mode waits** for the other side to initiate. If both sides are passive, *no one initiates*, so the LACP negotiation fails and no aggregation happens. You need one side to be **active** to get the link going.

# QUESTION 13

What happens when a Topology Change Notification (TCN) is received in a network using STP?

❌ All ports are set to the blocking state.  
✅ Ports may change their status from forwarding to blocked or vice versa.  
❌ The root bridge is re-elected.  
❌ The network topology remains unchanged.  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **All ports are set to the blocking state**: That would cause a total network outage. STP is designed to avoid loops, not to kill traffic everywhere during a change.

- ❌ **The root bridge is re-elected**: A TCN doesn’t trigger a root bridge re-election. That only happens if the root bridge becomes unreachable or a superior BPDU is received.

- ❌ **The network topology remains unchanged**: That completely contradicts the purpose of a **topology change** notification.

✅ **Ports may change their status from forwarding to blocked or vice versa**: Correct. A TCN signals that a change in the Layer 2 topology occurred — maybe a link went down or came up. STP reacts by recalculating the tree and updating port states as needed to maintain loop-free paths.

# QUESTION 14

Which of the following devices is most likely to be powered using PoE?

❌ Laptop  
✅ VoIP handset  
❌ Desktop computer  
❌ Laser printer  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **Laptop**: Laptops typically require more power than PoE can deliver, and they're powered via AC adapters or USB-C, not Ethernet.

- ❌ **Desktop computer**: Way too power-hungry. PoE maxes out at around 30W (or 60W+ with newer standards), and desktops often need several hundred watts.

- ❌ **Laser printer**: These also consume far more power than PoE can support, especially when printing (heating fusers, etc.).

✅ **VoIP handset**: Perfect fit for PoE. They're low-power devices, always Ethernet-connected, and often installed in places where running a separate power line would be impractical. PoE makes VoIP deployment clean and centralized.

# QUESTION 15

What is the maximum size of the data payload in a standard Ethernet frame?

✅ 1500 bytes  
❌ 9018 bytes  
❌ 1518 bytes  
❌ 18 bytes  

Why the others are wrong:

- ❌ **9018 bytes**: That’s the size of a **jumbo frame**, not a standard Ethernet frame. Jumbo frames are optional and not universally supported.

- ❌ **1518 bytes**: This is the **total size** of a standard Ethernet frame (without VLAN tagging) — it includes header (14 bytes), payload (1500 bytes), and FCS (4 bytes).

- ❌ **18 bytes**: That’s close to the **header** size (Ethernet header is 14 bytes + 4 bytes for CRC), but that’s not the payload.

✅ **1500 bytes**: Correct. The maximum **payload** size in a standard Ethernet frame (as defined by IEEE 802.3) is 1500 bytes. That’s the MTU for Ethernet at Layer 2.
