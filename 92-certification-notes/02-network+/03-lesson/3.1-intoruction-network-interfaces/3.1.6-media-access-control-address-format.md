## 🆔 3.1.6 – Media Access Control (MAC) Address Format

### ✅ What is a MAC Address?

A **MAC address** is a unique **48-bit** identifier assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC).  
It operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** and is used for **local network communication** (LAN).

---

### 📦 Format Examples

MAC addresses are typically displayed as:
- `00:60:8c:12:3a:bc` (colon-separated)
- `00-60-8c-12-3a-bc` (hyphen-separated)
- `00608c123abc` (no separator)
- `0060.8c12.3abc` (Cisco format with periods)

## 🔥 Burned-In vs Locally Administered

### 🔹 Burned-In Address (BIA):
- Hardcoded at the factory by the manufacturer.
- First **3 bytes** = OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
- Last **3 bytes** = Device-specific serial number

Example:
MAC: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E  
→ OUI: 00:1A:2B → Intel Corp  
→ Device ID: 3C:4D:5E
### 🔸 Locally Administered Address (LAA):
- Manually assigned by admin or software.
- 2nd-least-significant bit of 1st byte is set to **1**.
- Breaks OUI standard intentionally.

## 📺 Real-World Example: Wireshark Output

Captured ARP request:
Src MAC: ac:72:89:50:38:04 (Intel)  
Dst MAC: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (Broadcast)

Flags:
- LG bit = 1 → Locally Administered
- IG bit = 1 → Group (broadcast or multicast)


🧠 Wireshark may label:
- **L = Locally administered**
- **G = Group address (multicast/broadcast)**

## 🛰️ Special MAC Addresses

| Type          | Address                      | Meaning                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Broadcast     | `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`           | Send to all devices on the LAN   |
| Multicast     | Starts with `01:00:5e`        | Send to a group of devices       |
| Unicast       | Specific unique MAC           | One-to-one communication         |
| Loopback/NIC  | Varies (e.g., `00:00...`)     | Often unused or virtual          |

---

### 🧪 Example: MAC Bit Breakdown

MAC: `01:13:10:6B:17:A8`

First byte = `01` → binary = `00000001`

- Rightmost bit = `1` → IG (Individual/Group) = **group (multicast)**
- Second bit = `0` → UL (Universal/Local) = **universal (factory-assigned)**

---

### 📌 Practical Use (HTB / Security+ / Wireshark)

- **Nmap**: MAC shown in `-A` or `-O` scans.
- **Wireshark**: MAC flags help identify spoofed or fake traffic.
- **HTB**: ARP spoofing or DHCP starvation attacks use MAC knowledge.
- **Security+**: You’ll be tested on **MAC spoofing, filtering, segmentation**.
