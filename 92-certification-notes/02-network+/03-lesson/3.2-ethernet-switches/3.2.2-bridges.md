## 🧠 Lesson 3.2.2 – Bridges

### 📌 Overview
- Bridges operate at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model.
- Purpose: Split a physical network into multiple segments while keeping all devices in the **same logical (Layer 2) network**.
- Helps reduce **collisions** caused by too many nodes sharing the same segment.

---

### 🔀 Collision Domains
- Each port on a bridge defines a **separate collision domain**.
- Example:
  - Hub A (100 Mbps) and Hub B (10 Mbps) form two domains.
  - Bridge separates them, preventing devices on Hub A from interfering with devices on Hub B.

> Devices in one domain don't slow down or contend with traffic in another domain.

- Bridge still forwards traffic between domains as needed, creating a **single Layer 2 broadcast domain**.

---

### 📊 MAC Address Table
- A bridge builds a **MAC address table** by listening to frames on its ports.
- Tracks which **MAC address** is associated with which **port**.
- Table starts empty and fills dynamically.
- **Stale entries are flushed** over time to keep it current.

---

### 📣 Broadcast/Flooding Behavior
- If a bridge **doesn’t recognize** the destination MAC, or if the frame is a **broadcast/multicast**:
  - It **floods** the frame to **all other segments**, except the one it came from.
  - Acts like a hub in this case.

### 🧱 Summary – Bridge Capabilities
- 📍 **Layer**: 2 (Data Link)
- 🧠 **Intelligent filtering** using MAC table
- ⚠️ **Still one broadcast domain**
- 🔁 **Reduces collisions** by isolating domains
- 📡 **Forwards only relevant traffic** between segments

---

### 🧠 Analogy
> A bridge is like a traffic cop at an intersection who **directs only the necessary cars** through, instead of letting everyone flood the entire road.
