## Lesson Review – Question 1

**Q:** Which type of switch is typically used in a corporate network environment?

- [ ] SOHO switch  
- [ ] Desktop switch  
✅ **Managed switch**  
- [ ] Unmanaged switch  

---

### ❌ Why the others are wrong:

- **SOHO switch**  
  Designed for **Small Office/Home Office**, not full corporate networks. Often lacks remote management, VLAN support, and advanced security controls.

- **Desktop switch**  
  Intended for **small workgroups or individuals**. Limited ports, typically unmanaged, and not rack-mountable. Inappropriate for enterprise deployment.

- **Unmanaged switch**  
  No configuration, no segmentation, no monitoring. Plug-and-play only. Dangerous in business environments where access control and logging are critical.

---

### ✅ Why **Managed switch** is correct:

Managed switches provide:
- Remote access via CLI/Web/SNMP  
- VLANs, port security, and STP  
- Monitoring and control needed in **corporate networks**  
- Scalable and reliable for **enterprise traffic** management

## Lesson Review – Question 2

**Q:** What advantage does a stackable switch offer over a non-stackable switch?

- ✅ It simplifies network management by allowing multiple switches to be managed as a single unit.  
- [ ] It cannot be managed as a single unit.  
- [ ] It allows for physical stacking only, without any management benefits.  
- [ ] It offers fewer ports.  

**💡 Explanation:**  
**Stackable switches** provide both hardware scalability and centralized control. When stacked, they behave like one logical switch — one management IP, one config to back up, one CLI to command. Perfect for growing networks that want simplified administration.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"It cannot be managed as a single unit"* — That's the entire point of stacking. It *is* managed as a single unit.  
- ❌ *"Physical stacking only"* — Nope. Stackable switches offer **logical** stacking too, enabling true single-point management.  
- ❌ *"It offers fewer ports."* — Total nonsense. Stacking actually **increases** port count across the stack.

## Lesson Review – Question 3

**Q:** A network technician wants to upgrade the company's hub to isolate collision domains from each other and allow for Gigabit Ethernet.  
Which solution would help the technician to accomplish this?

- [ ] Network Adapters  
- [ ] Hub  
- ✅ Switch  
- [ ] Router  

**💡 Explanation:**  
A **switch** replaces hubs and isolates **collision domains** per port — that’s a big deal. Hubs throw everything on the same line, so collisions happen constantly. Switches prevent that, plus they support **Gigabit Ethernet**, unlike many older hubs.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Network Adapters* — These are NICs (network interface cards), which only connect devices to the network — they don’t isolate traffic or control domains.  
- ❌ *Hub* — That’s what you’re trying to get rid of. Hubs share bandwidth and broadcast every frame out every port — no separation at all.  
- ❌ *Router* — Routers separate **broadcast domains**, not collision domains. Wrong layer, wrong tool for the job.

---
## Lesson Review – Question 4

**Q:** What distinguishes a collision domain from a broadcast domain?

- [ ] Collision domains are established by routers, while broadcast domains are established by switches.  
- ✅ Collision domains are about physically shared media, and their borders are established by bridges and switches.  
- [ ] Collision domains can span multiple routers, while broadcast domains are limited to a single switch.  
- [ ] Broadcast domains require a layer 2 broadcast address to be established.

**💡 Explanation:**  
A **collision domain** is where data packets can collide — typically when devices share the same physical medium (like in a hub). **Switches and bridges** break up collision domains by giving each port its own segment.  
**Broadcast domains**, on the other hand, are bounded by **routers** (not switches). A broadcast sent from one device is seen by all others within that domain — unless a router blocks it.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Routers define collision domains* – backwards. Routers define **broadcast domains**, not collision ones.  
- ❌ *Collision domains can span routers* – nope. Each interface on a router is a new collision and broadcast domain.  
- ❌ *Broadcast domains require Layer 2 addresses* – irrelevant. Broadcasts are inherent to Layer 2, but this doesn't define the domain boundaries.

## Lesson Review – Question 5

**Q:** What is the primary benefit of configuring a switch port to "autonegotiate" speed and duplex settings?

- [ ] It restricts the switch port to operate only at the lowest possible speed for compatibility with older devices.  
- [ ] It manually sets the switch port to operate at a fixed speed and duplex mode, disregarding the capabilities of the connected device.  
- [ ] It disables the switch port from connecting to devices that do not support gigabit speeds.  
- ✅ It allows the switch port to automatically adjust to the highest possible speed and duplex mode based on the capabilities of the connected device.

**💡 Explanation:**  
**Autonegotiation** is a protocol that allows network devices to automatically exchange information about speed and duplex capabilities. This ensures both devices use the **highest common performance** mode — like Full Duplex at 1 Gbps, if both support it. It's efficient, flexible, and plug-and-play friendly.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Restricts to the lowest speed* – completely wrong. Autonegotiation chooses the **highest compatible** setting, not the lowest.  
- ❌ *Manually sets fixed speed* – that’s the **opposite** of autonegotiation. Manual configs are static and don’t adapt.  
- ❌ *Disables ports for non-gigabit devices* – nonsense. Autonegotiation actually supports a wide range of speeds, from 10 Mbps up.

## Lesson Review – Question 6

**Q:** What happens when VLANs are configured on a switch?

- [ ] The switch's performance is significantly reduced.  
- [ ] The switch operates in half-duplex mode.  
- ✅ The switch divides the network into multiple broadcast domains.  
- [ ] The switch can only support legacy network cards.

**💡 Explanation:**  
**VLANs (Virtual LANs)** allow a single physical switch to create **multiple broadcast domains**, effectively segmenting network traffic and improving security, performance, and traffic management. Devices on different VLANs can’t talk to each other without a router or Layer 3 switch.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Performance is significantly reduced* – VLANs actually help improve performance by limiting unnecessary broadcast traffic.  
- ❌ *Half-duplex mode* – has nothing to do with VLANs. That’s a physical layer setting; VLANs work regardless of duplex mode.  
- ❌ *Legacy network cards only* – VLANs are a logical (Layer 2) config; they work with modern and legacy NICs as long as the NIC supports tagging (802.1Q).

## Lesson Review – Question 7

**Q:** What command is used to enter the Global Configuration mode on a Cisco switch?

- [ ] `do copy running-config startup-config`  
- [ ] `enable`  
- [ ] `interface GigabitEthernet0/1`  
✅ `configure terminal`

**💡 Explanation:**  
To enter **Global Configuration mode**, the command is:

## Lesson Review – Question 8

**Q:** Which of the following outcomes should the network administrator expect after installing an Ethernet bridge between Segment A and Segment B?

- [ ] The Ethernet bridge will combine Segment A and Segment B into a single collision domain.  
- [ ] The Ethernet bridge will increase the bandwidth available to Segment B.  
- [ ] The Ethernet bridge will enable Segment A to use IP addresses from Segment B.  
✅ **The Ethernet bridge will prevent traffic from Segment A from impacting the performance of Segment B.**  

**💡 Explanation:**  
An **Ethernet bridge** separates collision domains by forwarding traffic only as needed. So, it helps isolate Segment A’s heavy traffic from Segment B, **reducing congestion and improving performance**. This is the *exact opposite* of combining them into a single domain.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **Combine into a single collision domain** – No. A **hub** would do that. A **bridge segments** the network and *reduces* collisions.  
- ❌ **Increase bandwidth** – Bridges **don’t increase** total bandwidth. They optimize traffic flow.  
- ❌ **IP address sharing** – That’s a **Layer 3 function** (handled by routers or DHCP), not something a Layer 2 bridge does.

---
## Lesson Review – Question 9

**Q:** At which layer of the OSI model does a hub operate?

- [ ] Application Layer  
- ✅ Physical Layer  
- [ ] Network Layer  
- [ ] Data Link Layer  

**💡 Explanation:**  
A **hub** is a dumb device — it has no awareness of MAC addresses or frames. It just takes electrical signals and rebroadcasts them to all ports. This puts it squarely in the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** of the OSI model.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **Application Layer** is Layer 7 — that’s where user-facing services like HTTP and email live. A hub is nowhere near that level.  
- ❌ **Network Layer** (Layer 3) deals with routing and IP addresses — again, **hubs don’t even know what IP is**.  
- ❌ **Data Link Layer** (Layer 2) handles MAC addresses and frames — switches live here. Hubs don’t process any of that.

## Lesson Review – Question 10

**Q:** What is the role of the CSMA/CD protocol in a hub-based Ethernet network?

- [ ] It increases the data transmission speed of the hub.  
- [ ] It assigns IP addresses to devices connected to the hub.  
- ✅ It manages the timing of data transmissions to avoid collisions.  
- [ ] It encrypts data to prevent unauthorized access.  

**💡 Explanation:**  
**CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is used in **half-duplex, shared-medium Ethernet networks** — exactly what you get with a hub. It **manages access to the medium** by listening first (carrier sense), detecting collisions, and retrying after a random backoff time.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **"Increases speed"** – Nope. CSMA/CD doesn't make things faster — it *deals with* collisions after they happen. In fact, collisions slow things down.  
- ❌ **"Assigns IP addresses"** – That’s DHCP’s job, not CSMA/CD.  
- ❌ **"Encrypts data"** – Totally unrelated. CSMA/CD is a Layer 2 protocol; encryption happens at higher layers or via specific hardware.
