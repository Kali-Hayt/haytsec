# QUESTION 1

What is a likely cause of giant frame errors in a network?

❌ Identical MTU settings across all network devices  
❌ A host and switch interface both configured for jumbo frames  
✅ A mismatch where the host is configured for jumbo frames, but the switch interface is not  
❌ A switch interface configured for jumbo frames, but the host is not  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Identical MTU settings** ensure consistent frame size handling—this prevents errors, not causes them.
- ❌ If **both host and switch** are configured for jumbo frames, they can pass large frames without issue.
- ❌ If **only the switch** supports jumbo frames, but the host doesn’t send them—no problem. The frames are within the host’s limit and won’t trigger giant errors.

✅ If the **host is sending jumbo frames** but the **switch isn’t configured to receive them**, the switch sees those oversized frames as “giants” and drops or flags them.

# QUESTION 2

What does the **show interface** command provide information about?

❌ Power supply status  
❌ VLAN assignments  
✅ State of all interfaces or a specified interface  
❌ Routing protocols  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Power supply status** is checked using commands like `show environment` or `show power`, not `show interface`.
- ❌ **VLAN assignments** are found with `show vlan` or `show interfaces switchport`, not the base `show interface` output.
- ❌ **Routing protocols** info comes from `show ip protocols` or specific routing protocol commands (like `show ospf`, `show eigrp`).

✅ `show interface` gives detailed stats about:
- Physical & link layer status (`up/down`, errors, collisions)
- Bandwidth, MTU
- Input/output statistics
- Interface counters (e.g. CRC errors, drops)

🧠 Think of it as the **health monitor for ports**.

# QUESTION 3

A network engineer is troubleshooting connectivity issues on a switch network. They discover that when a specific device sends a frame, the switch floods the frame out of all ports except the source port.

What does this indicate about the destination MAC address in relation to the switch's MAC address table?

❌ The destination MAC address is correctly mapped in the MAC address table.  
✅ The destination MAC address is not found in the MAC address table.  
❌ The MAC address table is full and cannot learn new addresses.  
❌ The switch has a malfunctioning port.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ If the **MAC address was correctly mapped**, the switch would forward the frame only to the specific destination port—not flood it.
- ❌ If the **MAC table was full**, you’d likely see erratic flooding for many unknown MACs, not just one. Also, the switch would log a capacity warning.
- ❌ A **malfunctioning port** could drop frames or show errors, but it wouldn’t cause a flood pattern like this.

✅ This is standard behavior:  
When a **destination MAC address is unknown**, the switch floods the frame to **all ports** (except the source) to find the destination.

# QUESTION 4

Which of the following methods improves the thermal performance of Power Over Ethernet (PoE) cabling?

❌ Increasing the length of the cable  
❌ Using unshielded cabling  
❌ Using thinner conductors  
✅ Using pure copper cabling with thicker conductors  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Longer cable = more resistance**, more voltage drop, and more heat. Shorter is better.
- ❌ **Unshielded cabling** offers no thermal benefit; shielding mainly blocks EMI, not heat.
- ❌ **Thinner conductors** increase resistance → more heat generated = worse thermal performance.

✅ **Thicker pure copper conductors** = lower resistance = less heat = better thermal dissipation.  
✅ PoE generates heat as it pushes current over data wires—better material & gauge = cooler operation.

🛠️ For PoE, use **solid pure copper, 23 AWG or thicker** (avoid CCA = Copper-Clad Aluminum).

# QUESTION 5

What does an interface "flap" indicate?

✅ An interface switching between up and down states  
❌ High-quality cable and termination  
❌ A stable network connection  
❌ A low number of CRC errors  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Good cable and termination** prevent flapping—they don’t *cause* it.
- ❌ **Stable network connection** is the opposite of what flapping signals.
- ❌ **Low CRC errors** suggest healthy traffic. Interface flapping usually accompanies *link loss*, not CRC-specific issues.

✅ Interface "flapping" = port constantly going **up/down**, often due to:
- Loose or faulty cables
- Bad SFP/transceiver
- Interface misconfigurations
- Power or hardware instability

🛠️ Check logs with `show log` or interface counters to diagnose repeated flaps.

# QUESTION 6

A network engineer is troubleshooting an issue where a specific workstation cannot access network resources. Preliminary checks show that the workstation's network adapter is functioning correctly, and the cable has been tested and verified to work with another device.

The workstation is connected to port Gi1/0/24 on a switch. The engineer suspects a configuration issue on the switch port might be the root cause.

To analyze the situation, which command should the engineer use to view both the current operational status and the configuration of port Gi1/0/24?

✅ show interface Gi1/0/24  
❌ show running-config interface Gi1/0/24  
❌ show mac address-table interface Gi1/0/24  
❌ show vlan brief  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ `show running-config interface` shows **configuration only**—no live status (like link up/down, input errors, or speed).
- ❌ `show mac address-table` tells you if the port has learned a MAC—but not port state, duplex, or errors.
- ❌ `show vlan brief` shows VLAN-to-port mappings—not operational/interface-level status.

✅ `show interface Gi1/0/24` gives you:
- Interface status (up/down, admin or physical)
- Speed and duplex
- Errors, drops, CRCs
- Queue and load stats

🛠️ This is your **go-to command** when you need to see **live link behavior**.

# QUESTION 7

What should be done if there is a loop and spanning tree has shut down the port?

✅ Inspect physical ports for looped connections.  
❌ Add more switches to the network.  
❌ Disable the spanning tree protocol.  
❌ Increase the bandwidth of the network.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Adding more switches** does nothing to solve a loop—could actually make it worse.
- ❌ **Disabling STP** is reckless—it’s your only protection against broadcast storms and bridging loops.
- ❌ **Increasing bandwidth** doesn’t prevent loops or fix blocked ports—just masks the symptom, not the cause.

✅ **STP shuts down a port** when it detects a loop in the Layer 2 topology.
- You need to **physically trace cables** and look for:
  - Redundant connections not needed
  - Accidental loops (like a patch cable bridging two ports on the same switch)
- Once the loop is resolved, STP will **re-enable the port** if configured properly.

🧠 STP isn’t the problem—it’s the **safety mechanism** alerting you to one.

# QUESTION 8

What role does the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) play in preventing network loops?

❌ It encrypts data packets to secure network traffic.  
❌ It directly increases the speed of network traffic.  
✅ It automatically shuts down redundant paths to prevent loops.  
❌ It assigns IP addresses to devices on the network.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encryption** is handled by protocols like IPSec, SSL/TLS—not STP.
- ❌ **STP doesn’t boost speed**—in fact, it may block some paths to maintain loop-free topology.
- ❌ **IP addressing** is done by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), not STP.

✅ STP is a Layer 2 protocol that:
- Identifies redundant links between switches
- Elects a root bridge and builds a loop-free tree
- **Puts backup ports into a blocking state** unless needed

🛡️ It’s your network’s insurance policy against broadcast storms and infinite loops.

# QUESTION 9

Which of the following should you consider when suspecting a network switch is the cause of network issues?

❌ Increase the bandwidth of the switch to handle more traffic.  
❌ Replace all network cables connected to the switch.  
✅ Analyze the network topology to identify affected users and devices.  
❌ Install additional cooling systems for the switch.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increasing bandwidth** is premature—only valid if traffic saturation is confirmed. Diagnose first.
- ❌ **Replacing all cables** wastes time and money unless you’ve confirmed physical layer issues.
- ❌ **Cooling systems** are helpful for overheating, but there’s no thermal issue mentioned here.

✅ The **first step in switch troubleshooting** is understanding **which parts of the network are affected**:
- Which users are down?
- Is the issue isolated to a specific VLAN, port, or uplink?
- Could a loop or broadcast storm be involved?

🕵️ Smart troubleshooting starts with **mapping the damage**—not blindly swapping parts.

# QUESTION 10

What actions does the use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) allow for during power anomalies in enterprise sites? *(Select two.)*

✅ Switch to a secondary power source.  
❌ Increase the processing power of servers.  
❌ Automatically repair damaged network cables.  
✅ Shut down the system gracefully.  
❌ Permanently replace the main power source.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Processing power** has nothing to do with power supply type. UPS doesn't change CPU performance.
- ❌ UPSs can’t **repair cables**—no physical layer healing magic here.
- ❌ UPSs are a **temporary power solution**, not a **permanent replacement** for a failed main source.

✅ UPS systems provide:
- **Battery backup** power to keep critical systems running temporarily
- Time to **switch over to a generator or secondary source**
- Time to **shut down systems gracefully** (avoid data corruption or hardware damage)

🧯 Think of UPS as the fire extinguisher of power—short term, life-saving, but not a long-term fix.

# QUESTION 11

What does the **show startup-config** command display?

❌ The switch's current operational status  
❌ The switch's temporary configuration  
✅ The switch's configuration upon the next reboot  
❌ The list of errors logged by the switch  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Operational status** is shown by commands like `show interface`, `show status`, or `show ip interface brief`.
- ❌ **Temporary (running) config** is displayed using `show running-config`.
- ❌ **Error logs** come from `show logging`, not startup-config.

✅ `show startup-config` pulls the configuration **stored in NVRAM**, which:
- Loads automatically when the switch/router boots
- Is the "saved state" after issuing a `write` or `copy run start`

🧠 Think of it as the BIOS settings of a Cisco device—it determines how the device starts up.

# QUESTION 12

What does a blinking amber LED on a switch port signify?

❌ The link is connected but there is no traffic.  
❌ The port is blocked by the spanning tree algorithm.  
❌ The link is operating normally with traffic.  
✅ A fault has been detected.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **No traffic** usually shows as solid green or no LED—not blinking amber.
- ❌ **STP-blocked ports** typically show **solid amber**, not blinking.
- ❌ **Normal operation with traffic** is shown by **blinking green**, not amber.

✅ A **blinking amber LED** typically means:
- Port is in **err-disabled** (error-disabled) state
- Faults like BPDU Guard violations, excessive errors, or security violations occurred
- Needs manual or automatic recovery via `shutdown` / `no shutdown` or errdisable recovery config

⚠️ Blinking amber = device warning: “I’ve shut this port down for your own good.”

# QUESTION 13

What is a runt frame error?

❌ A frame larger than the maximum permissible size  
❌ A frame transmitted with high signal quality  
✅ A frame that is smaller than the minimum size  
❌ A frame with no CRC errors  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ A **larger-than-allowed** frame is called a **giant**, not a runt.
- ❌ High signal quality has nothing to do with frame size—this is irrelevant to runt frames.
- ❌ A **frame with no CRC errors** is not considered a runt—it’s a valid frame.

✅ A **runt frame** is:
- Smaller than the **minimum Ethernet frame size** (64 bytes, including header and CRC)
- Usually caused by:
  - Collisions
  - Malformed transmissions
  - Faulty NICs or cabling

🧱 Ethernet has size limits:  
- Min: 64 bytes  
- Max (standard): 1518 bytes  
Frames smaller than 64 bytes = *runt* = error.

# QUESTION 14

What does a smaller American Wire Gauge (AWG) number indicate?

❌ Less heat generation  
❌ Lower quality of cabling  
❌ Thinner conductors  
✅ Thicker conductors  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ While thicker wires *can* reduce heat, AWG alone doesn’t directly indicate thermal behavior without considering load. So “less heat generation” is too broad.
- ❌ Lower AWG = thicker = **usually higher quality**, not lower.
- ❌ A **smaller AWG number actually means thicker wire**, not thinner. This one's backwards.

✅ The AWG scale is **inverted**:
- **Lower number = thicker conductor**  
  - Ex: 23 AWG is thicker than 26 AWG
- Thicker wires = lower resistance = better for:
  - PoE
  - Long cable runs
  - Reduced voltage drop and thermal buildup

📏 AWG is like golf scores—the lower, the better (and bulkier).

# QUESTION 15

What is the significance of the "four-pair" mode in Power Over Ethernet (PoE) technology?

❌ It delivers power only, without data transmission.  
❌ It is only compatible with the original PoE standard.  
❌ It is used exclusively for 10G Ethernet connections.  
✅ It delivers power over all four pairs of wires in the cable.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ PoE **always transmits power alongside data**—never “power only.” Ethernet is still active.
- ❌ **Original PoE (IEEE 802.3af)** only used **two pairs**. Four-pair came with newer PoE+ and PoE++ standards (IEEE 802.3bt).
- ❌ Four-pair mode is not exclusive to 10G—it's about **power delivery**, not speed.

✅ Newer PoE types like **802.3bt (Type 3 & Type 4)**:
- Use **all 4 wire pairs** to deliver **up to 60W or 100W**
- Spread current evenly = reduced heat buildup = better thermal efficiency
- Still support **data transmission** over the same cable

⚡ More pairs = more power, better efficiency, less heat.

# QUESTION 16

What is the primary purpose of using the **show mac address-table** command in troubleshooting network issues?

❌ To list the IP addresses assigned to all devices on the network  
✅ To identify the MAC addresses associated with a particular switch port  
❌ To display the routing table of a switch  
❌ To reset the MAC address table on the switch  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ IP addresses aren’t part of the MAC address table—you’d use `show ip dhcp binding` or `arp` instead.
- ❌ The **routing table** is viewed with `show ip route`, not `show mac address-table`.
- ❌ This command is **read-only**—it **doesn’t reset** the MAC table.

✅ `show mac address-table` shows:
- Which **MAC addresses** were learned
- Which **port** they were learned on
- What **VLAN** they belong to

🛠️ Crucial for:
- Tracing a host's physical location
- Detecting spoofed MACs
- Identifying which switch port is associated with a specific device
