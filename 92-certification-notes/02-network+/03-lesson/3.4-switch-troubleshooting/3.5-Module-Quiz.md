# QUESTION 1

What does a flickering green LED on a switch port indicate?

❌ The port is shut down.  
✅ The link is operating normally with traffic.  
❌ The port is blocked by the spanning tree algorithm.  
❌ There is a duplex mismatch.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Shut down** ports typically have **no light** at all—or possibly amber if err-disabled.
- ❌ **STP-blocked** ports usually show a **solid amber** LED, not green.
- ❌ **Duplex mismatches** may cause poor performance, but they don't cause LED flickering alone.

✅ A **flickering green LED** = port is **up** and actively passing traffic.  
It’s a visual heartbeat—“I’m alive and forwarding.”

# QUESTION 2

What distinguishes a collision domain from a broadcast domain?

❌ Collision domains are established by routers, while broadcast domains are established by switches.  
✅ Collision domains are about physically shared media, and their borders are established by bridges and switches.  
❌ Collision domains can span multiple routers, while broadcast domains are limited to a single switch.  
❌ Broadcast domains require a layer 2 broadcast address to be established.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Routers **create broadcast domain boundaries**, not collision domains.
- ❌ Collision domains are confined to single links—not spanning across routers.
- ❌ Layer 2 **broadcast addresses (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)** are always present—don’t define domain boundaries.

✅ **Collision domain** = where Ethernet devices contend for the same wire (half-duplex).  
✅ **Broadcast domain** = where broadcast traffic reaches all devices—limited by routers.

🧱 Every **switch port** is its own collision domain.  
Entire **VLAN** = one broadcast domain.

# QUESTION 3

A network administrator is troubleshooting a connectivity issue between two servers in different segments of a WAN. The administrator suspects that MTU mismatches might be causing the problem.

What steps should the administrator take to diagnose and resolve the issue?

❌ Increase the MTU on both servers to the maximum allowable value to ensure they can handle larger packets.  
❌ Disable error checking on both servers to prevent MTU size from affecting connectivity.  
✅ Use a network analyzer to determine the MTU sizes supported along the path and adjust the servers' MTU to match the smallest MTU found.  
❌ Decrease the MTU on both servers to the minimum allowable value to minimize packet fragmentation.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increasing MTU blindly** can cause more fragmentation or drops if the path can't support large packets.
- ❌ **Disabling error checking** is dangerous and doesn’t solve the root issue—it hides it.
- ❌ **Lowering MTU to minimum** might fix the problem, but it sacrifices performance and is overkill.

✅ The correct approach:
- Use tools like `ping -f -l` (Windows) or `tracepath`/`mturoute` (Linux) to **discover the smallest MTU on the route**.
- **Match the server MTU to that value** to prevent fragmentation or drops.

🎯 MTU mismatches = classic silent killer of WAN performance.

# QUESTION 4

Which of the following is **NOT** a potential cause of a broadcast storm on a network where spanning tree is already enabled?

❌ Physical configuration of segments using legacy equipment like Ethernet hubs  
✅ A high number of DHCP requests  
❌ Incompatible versions of Spanning Tree Protocol or Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol on different switches  
❌ Networking devices connected as part of a loop  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Hubs** forward all traffic, including broadcasts, to every port—can easily trigger broadcast storms.
- ❌ **Incompatible STP versions** can cause loops if they fail to properly block redundant paths.
- ❌ **Physical loops** are the root cause of broadcast storms. STP is designed to block these—but if misconfigured, storms can still happen.

✅ **DHCP requests**, even in high volume, are **unicast after the initial broadcast** and are rate-limited by clients.  
They **do not cause storms** on their own.

🌀 Broadcast storm = too many Layer 2 broadcast frames circling due to **loop** or **hub misuse**.

# QUESTION 5

Which statement best describes the relationship between a broadcast domain and the use of the MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff?

✅ The MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used to send a frame to all devices within the same broadcast domain.  
❌ The MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used to exclude certain devices from receiving a broadcast within a broadcast domain.  
❌ The MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used to identify the broadcast domain itself.  
❌ The MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used to send a frame to a specific device within a broadcast domain.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Exclusion** isn’t possible with broadcasts—broadcasts go to **every device** in the domain.
- ❌ The **broadcast domain** is defined by Layer 2 device boundaries (switches, VLANs)—not by a MAC address.
- ❌ Sending to a **specific device** uses a **unicast MAC address**, not the broadcast one.

✅ `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` = **Layer 2 broadcast** destination address.  
It tells the switch to **flood the frame to all ports** in the VLAN/broadcast domain—except the one it came in on.

🧱 This is how ARP, DHCP Discover, and similar protocols reach every node in a subnet.

# QUESTION 7

What configuration should be applied to effectively increase the bandwidth and alleviate the network bottleneck?

❌ Configure all network interfaces and corresponding switch ports to operate at 100 Mbps to ensure equal load distribution.  
❌ Configure the server's network interfaces and the corresponding switch ports in LACP passive mode.  
✅ Configure the server's network interfaces in **LACP active mode** and the corresponding switch ports in **LACP passive mode**.  
❌ Disable three network interfaces on each server to focus traffic through a single 1 Gbps connection.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Downgrading to 100 Mbps** reduces bandwidth—this is the exact opposite of what's needed.
- ❌ If **both sides are in LACP passive**, **no link aggregation** will form—LACP needs at least one side active.
- ❌ Disabling interfaces defeats the purpose of **link aggregation** (i.e., bandwidth increase via bundling).

✅ **LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)**:
- Bundles multiple interfaces into one logical link
- Requires one side in **active mode** to initiate the negotiation
- **Active/passive combo** is a valid and efficient configuration

🧱 4 x 1 Gbps in LACP = up to **4 Gbps aggregated throughput**, assuming load balancing and traffic patterns support it.

# QUESTION 8

What is the primary purpose of a Multi-Source Agreement (MSA) in the context of modular transceivers?

❌ To decrease the cost of transceivers  
❌ To increase the data transmission speed of transceivers  
✅ To ensure compatibility between transceivers from different vendors  
❌ To standardize the size of transceivers  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ MSAs don’t **control cost**—pricing is market-driven.
- ❌ MSAs don’t **increase transmission speed**—that’s determined by physical layer specs like 10GBASE-SR.
- ❌ Size standardization is a **side effect**, not the core goal.

✅ **Multi-Source Agreements (MSAs)**:
- Define **form factors, pinouts, and electrical specs** for transceivers
- Allow different vendors to build **interoperable hardware** (e.g., SFP, QSFP modules)
- Promote competition and reduce vendor lock-in

🧱 Without MSAs, you’d need proprietary optics for every brand—hello, nightmare.

# QUESTION 9

What command is used to enter the Global Configuration mode on a Cisco switch?

❌ `do copy running-config startup-config`  
❌ `enable`  
❌ `interface GigabitEthernet0/1`  
✅ `configure terminal`  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ `do copy running-config startup-config` saves the config—it has nothing to do with entering a configuration mode.
- ❌ `enable` gets you into **Privileged EXEC mode**, not **Global Config mode**.
- ❌ `interface GigabitEthernet0/1` is a **subcommand** you can only use *after* entering global config.

✅ `configure terminal` (or just `conf t`) drops you into **Global Configuration Mode**, where you can:
- Configure interfaces, VLANs, routing, passwords, etc.
- Launch into sub-modes like `interface`, `router`, or `line`

🧠 Think of `configure terminal` as the gateway to customizing your switch’s behavior.

# QUESTION 10

What steps should you take first when troubleshooting overheating issues with network devices? *(Select two.)*

✅ Ensure good airflow around intake and outlet vents.  
✅ Keep the devices away from direct sunlight.  
❌ Decrease the network load.  
❌ Change the IP address of the devices.  
❌ Install additional RAM in the devices.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Network load** affects CPU and throughput, but not usually heat directly—unless sustained under poor airflow.
- ❌ **IP addresses** have no relation to thermal behavior. Irrelevant.
- ❌ **RAM upgrades** are performance-related, not thermal fixes—and may void hardware warranties.

✅ Heat management is a **physical environment issue**:
- Good ventilation = essential for airflow over internal components
- Avoiding sunlight prevents passive heat buildup

🌡️ Rule of thumb: treat switches and routers like sensitive reptiles—cool, dry, and shaded.

# QUESTION 11

During a network upgrade, a network administrator needs to verify that all interfaces on a switch are operational and that no interfaces have been inadvertently shut down or disabled. The administrator also wants to ensure that there are no speed or duplex mismatches that could affect network performance.

Which command should the administrator use to efficiently review the operational status, speed, and duplex settings of all interfaces on the switch?

✅ **show interfaces status**  
❌ show ip interface brief  
❌ show running-config  
❌ show interfaces  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **show ip interface brief** — Good for **up/down** status and IPs, but **does not show duplex/speed** details. Better suited for routers or IP-focused checks.
- ❌ **show running-config** — Displays config line-by-line; not efficient for reviewing **interface statuses** in bulk.
- ❌ **show interfaces** — Very detailed (lots of counters), but **too verbose** for quick overview—good for deep dives, not quick audits.

✅ `show interfaces status` = quick snapshot:
- Interface name  
- Status (connected, notconnect, err-disabled)  
- VLAN  
- Duplex & Speed  
- Port type  

Perfect tool for a **switch port audit** mid-upgrade. Fast, focused, and admin-friendly.

# QUESTION 12

How does link aggregation contribute to network redundancy?

❌ By encrypting data packets to prevent unauthorized access  
❌ By blocking all incoming connections to secure the network  
✅ **By allowing a network connection to be maintained even if one link fails**  
❌ By reducing the overall network speed to conserve bandwidth  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encrypting data packets** — That’s a job for IPsec or SSL/TLS, not link aggregation. Aggregation handles **bandwidth and redundancy**, not security.
- ❌ **Blocking all incoming connections** — That would just kill connectivity entirely. Sounds more like a firewall or access control thing.
- ❌ **Reducing network speed** — Link aggregation **increases** bandwidth (by bundling links), not reducing it.

🧱 **Link Aggregation (aka EtherChannel or LACP):**
- Combines multiple physical links into one logical link
- ✅ Improves throughput
- ✅ Adds redundancy — if one link drops, traffic shifts to the others without killing the session

This is classic high-availability engineering: one pipe clogs, the rest keep things flowing.

# QUESTION 13

Which of the following BEST describes a MAC address?

❌ A logical grouping of computers through segmentation  
✅ **A 48-bit number that serves as a unique identifier for network devices**  
❌ A set of computers and devices connected in one physical area  
❌ A procedure that maps a dynamic IP address to a static physical machine address  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Logical grouping through segmentation** — That describes **VLANs**, not MAC addresses.
- ❌ **Set of devices in one area** — That’s more like a **LAN** (Local Area Network), not a MAC address.
- ❌ **Mapping dynamic IP to static MAC** — That hints at **DHCP reservation**, not what a MAC address *is*.

🧱 **MAC Address = Media Access Control Address**
- Unique, hardcoded at the factory (usually)
- 48 bits = 6 bytes = 12 hex digits (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`)
- Used at OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)
- Like a device’s “home address” on the network

Your switch relies on these for forwarding frames. If IPs are the envelopes, MACs are the street addresses.

# QUESTION 14

What should be investigated if a broadcast storm occurs despite spanning tree being enabled?

❌ The color of the Ethernet cables  
❌ The price of network equipment  
❌ The brand of network switches used  
✅ **Compatible versions of Spanning Tree Protocol on all switches**  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Color of Ethernet cables** — Aesthetics don’t affect loops or protocol behavior.
- ❌ **Price of network equipment** — Cheap ≠ bad and expensive ≠ reliable. It’s the configuration that counts.
- ❌ **Brand of switches** — Most switches support common protocols like STP, but **interoperability** depends on *versions and settings*, not the brand name.

🧱 **STP Version Compatibility**
- Classic STP vs RSTP vs MSTP — mixing them can cause problems if not done carefully.
- Incompatibility might result in failure to block redundant paths → network loops → **broadcast storm**.

🔍 A broadcast storm *with STP running* means STP might not be working correctly. Check:
- STP version mismatch
- Misconfigured VLANs (per-VLAN STP)
- Switches that don’t support STP or have it disabled

A “storm” means your bridge protocol isn’t bridging the gap.

# QUESTION 15

What improvement does Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) offer over the original 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol?

✅ **Multiple states aggregated into single state**  
❌ Outages lasting tens of seconds  
❌ Longer convergence times  
❌ Increased number of port states  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Outages lasting tens of seconds** — That was STP's *problem*, not a feature. RSTP *fixes* this by converging in **milliseconds to a few seconds**, not tens.
- ❌ **Longer convergence times** — RSTP is literally built for *rapid* convergence.
- ❌ **Increased number of port states** — Actually, RSTP *reduces* the number of port states from 5 (in STP) to 3: Discarding, Learning, Forwarding. 🧱

🧱 STP (802.1D) port states:
- **Blocking**, **Listening**, **Learning**, **Forwarding**, **Disabled**

✅ RSTP merges:
- **Blocking, Listening, Disabled** → **Discarding**

🎯 Result: Simplified logic + faster recovery.

RSTP = STP but on espresso. Converges fast, simplified states, and cuts downtime dramatically.

# QUESTION 16

What does a negative dBm value indicate in the context of Ethernet transceivers?

✅ **Signal strength is less than 1 milliwatt.**  
❌ The device is receiving no signal at all.  
❌ Signal strength is stronger than 1 milliwatt.  
❌ The device is malfunctioning.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The device is receiving no signal at all** — No signal would likely read as **undefined** or **below the sensitivity threshold**, not just “negative.” A weak signal ≠ no signal.
- ❌ **Signal strength is stronger than 1 milliwatt** — That would be a **positive dBm** value. dBm = 0 means **1 mW**, so anything below that is negative.
- ❌ **The device is malfunctioning** — A negative dBm is completely normal for optical or RF transceivers. It’s not an error — just a **measurement**.

🧱 dBm = decibels relative to 1 milliwatt  
- **0 dBm** = 1 mW  
- **-10 dBm** = 0.1 mW  
- **-30 dBm** = 0.001 mW

🛠️ In fiber optics, values like **-12 to -24 dBm** are **expected** receive levels. It’s just physics, not failure.

# QUESTION 17

A network administrator is trying to figure out which switch will be rooted in a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) setup  
Which of the following would determine the root?

❌ **BPDU**  
❌ **Highest ID**  
✅ **Lowest ID**  
❌ **DPs**

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **BPDU** — These are the *messages* sent between switches during STP, but BPDUs don’t *determine* the root themselves. They're just the **mechanism**, not the **criteria**.
- ❌ **Highest ID** — The **lowest Bridge ID** always becomes the root bridge. Lower = more desirable.
- ❌ **DPs** — Designated Ports are chosen **after** the root bridge is elected. They're a result of root election, not a factor in it.

🧱 **Bridge ID = Bridge Priority (default 32768) + MAC Address**  
So the "lowest" bridge is the one with the lowest combined value.

💡Want to force a switch to become the root? Set a **lower bridge priority** manually using:
```bash
spanning-tree vlan X priority 0
```
That'll win every time unless someone else sets it to 0 too.

# QUESTION 18

Angela is the network administrator for a rapidly growing company with a 100BaseT network. Users have recently complained about slow file transfers.  
While checking network traffic, Angela discovers a high number of collisions.  

Which connectivity device would BEST reduce the number of collisions and allow future growth?

❌ Hub  
❌ Bridge  
❌ Router  
✅ Switch  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Hub** — This is literally the **cause** of collisions. Hubs operate at Layer 1 and just repeat bits to all ports. Collision domain = the whole hub.
- ❌ **Bridge** — Bridges can separate collision domains but are outdated and have limited port counts. Not ideal for "future growth."
- ❌ **Router** — Routers operate at Layer 3 and separate broadcast domains, not collision domains. Overkill for this situation.

✅ **Switch** — Operates at Layer 2, creates a **separate collision domain per port**, and supports full-duplex communication = **no collisions**. Scalable and perfect for a growing network.

🧱 Collision domains:  
- Hub: One big shared mess  
- Switch: One per port  
- Bridge: Two ports = two collision domains  

---

# QUESTION 19

How does a hub handle a unicast transmission?

❌ It discards the transmission if it does not recognize the destination address.  
❌ It encrypts the transmission before sending it to the destination.  
✅ It broadcasts the transmission to all connected devices.  
❌ It sends the transmission directly to the destination address without broadcasting.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Discards if it doesn’t recognize** — Hubs don’t even *recognize* addresses. They’re dumb Layer 1 repeaters, not Layer 2 devices.
- ❌ **Encrypts the transmission** — Hubs have **zero intelligence**. No encryption, no logic, no awareness.
- ❌ **Sends directly to destination** — That’s how **switches** work. Hubs send to *everyone*.

✅ **Broadcasts to all connected devices** — Technically, a hub "floods" frames out all ports *except the one it came in on*, even for unicasts. It doesn’t care if it’s unicast, multicast, or broadcast.

🧱 TL;DR: A hub is like yelling across a room — everyone hears, even if the message isn’t for them.

# QUESTION 20

Which device sends signals from a computer onto a network?

❌ Gateway  
✅ Transceiver  
❌ Router  
❌ Cable  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Gateway** — Translates between different networks/protocols (e.g., email to SMS). It’s not responsible for signal transmission at the physical level.
- ❌ **Router** — Forwards packets between networks (Layer 3). It doesn’t *originate* signals from a host.
- ❌ **Cable** — Just the medium. It carries the signal, but doesn’t *generate* or *send* it.

✅ **Transceiver** — Short for *transmitter/receiver*, it’s the actual device that converts digital data from the computer into electrical (or optical) signals for the network, and vice versa. Every NIC has a built-in transceiver.

🧱 Think of it like this:
> Your computer is the brain, the transceiver is the mouth, the cable is the air the sound travels through — and the router is the traffic cop listening for directions.
