## 3.4.7 ‚Äì Power Over Ethernet (PoE) Issues

PoE delivers power and data over Ethernet cables to devices like:
- ‚úÖ VoIP handsets
- ‚úÖ IP cameras
- ‚úÖ Wireless access points (APs)

---

### üß± Cabling Issues
- PoE+ requires **Cat 5e or better**, but **Cat 6A is recommended**.
- Power draw = more heat ‚Üí affects data rates if not dissipated.
- ‚úÖ Pure copper cables with **thicker conductors** (e.g., **23 AWG**) perform better than 24 AWG.
- ‚ùå Thin/cheap cables = more resistance = more heat.
- ‚úÖ Shielded cables disperse heat better.

> **Note:** Smaller AWG = thicker wire. So 23 AWG is better than 24 AWG for PoE+.

### üß± Incorrect Standard
- Powered Devices (PDs) must **negotiate PoE mode** with the switch.
- ‚ùå Mismatches happen when:
  - Devices only support **older PoE standards**.
  - Switch interface is set to **PoE++ (Type 4)** but PD supports only Type 1.
- Types:
  - **Alt A:** Pairs 1/2 and 3/6 (10/100/1000)
  - **Alt B:** Pairs 4/5 and 7/8 (not for Gigabit)
  - **Four-pair:** All pairs (PoE++ and 10G support)

---

### üß± Power Budget Exceeded
- Switches have a **total power budget** (typically **300‚Äì400W**).
- If the combined PoE load > budget:
  - Some PDs won‚Äôt power on.
  - Others may randomly reset.

#### üîç Troubleshooting
- Use `show power inline` to check:
  - **Available** power
  - **Used** and **Remaining**
  - Port-by-port PoE info:
    - Admin + Operational state
    - Power draw (W)
    - Connected Device
    - Class + Max power

#### Example Output:
Available: 370.0(w) Used: 30.0(w) Remaining: 340.0(w)
