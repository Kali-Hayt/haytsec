# QUESTION 1  
What is the primary purpose of using a hybrid topology in modern networks?

❌ To limit the number of devices in the network  
❌ To simplify network design and management  
❌ To reduce the overall cost of the network infrastructure  
✅ To implement redundancy and fault tolerance  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *To limit the number of devices in the network*  
  → Hybrid topologies don’t reduce the number of devices—they often **increase** device count to support redundancy.

- ❌ *To simplify network design and management*  
  → Hybrid topologies are **more complex**, not simpler. Their strength lies in flexibility and fault tolerance, not ease of setup.

- ❌ *To reduce the overall cost of the network infrastructure*  
  → Nope. Hybrid designs often **cost more** because they combine multiple topologies and require more hardware (like redundant links).

# QUESTION 2  
Why might a medium-sized network opt for a collapsed core model?

✅ To simplify the network by combining core and distribution layers  
❌ To decrease the scalability of the network  
❌ To increase the complexity of the network  
❌ To implement traffic policies at the access layer  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *To decrease the scalability of the network*  
  → That’s a side effect, not a **reason**. It’s true scalability can be reduced, but the purpose is simplicity, not limitation.

- ❌ *To increase the complexity of the network*  
  → The goal of a collapsed core is the **opposite**—reduce complexity for small/medium networks.

- ❌ *To implement traffic policies at the access layer*  
  → Traffic policy implementation is typically handled at the **distribution** layer, not the access layer, and definitely not a reason to collapse core.

# QUESTION 3  
What does a hierarchical star-mesh topology involve?

✅ Nodes at the top of the hierarchy configured in a mesh for redundancy  
❌ A single central device connecting all other nodes  
❌ A decentralized network without any hierarchical structure  
❌ A direct connection between every pair of nodes in the network  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *A single central device connecting all other nodes*  
  → That’s describing a **star topology**, not a **star-mesh hybrid**.

- ❌ *A decentralized network without any hierarchical structure*  
  → This contradicts the “hierarchical” part of **hierarchical star-mesh**—which **does** have structured tiers.

- ❌ *A direct connection between every pair of nodes in the network*  
  → That’s a **full mesh** topology. In hierarchical star-mesh, **only upper-tier nodes** are meshed, not all nodes.

# QUESTION 4  
What is the primary difference between a router and a layer 3 switch?

❌ A router connects end-user devices to the network.  
❌ A layer 3 switch establishes a full mesh topology.  
✅ A layer 3 switch cannot perform WAN routing.  
❌ A router provides a high-speed backbone for the network.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *A router connects end-user devices to the network*  
  → That’s typically the job of **access switches**, not routers. Routers connect **networks to networks**.

- ❌ *A layer 3 switch establishes a full mesh topology*  
  → Topology isn’t dictated by device type. A layer 3 switch **can** be part of a full mesh, but it doesn’t inherently create one.

- ❌ *A router provides a high-speed backbone for the network*  
  → Not always. Routers may handle WAN traffic, but **core switches** or **layer 3 switches** often make up the high-speed backbone in LANs.

# QUESTION 5  
Which layer in the three-tiered network hierarchy is responsible for providing fault-tolerant interconnections between different access blocks?

✅ Distribution Layer  
❌ Wireless Access Layer  
❌ Core Layer  
❌ Access Layer  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Wireless Access Layer*  
  → This isn’t even part of the standard three-tier model. It's a **subset of the access layer**, not a distinct design layer.

- ❌ *Core Layer*  
  → The core handles **high-speed backbone routing**, not access block interconnection policies or fault tolerance between access layers.

- ❌ *Access Layer*  
  → The access layer connects **end-user devices**—not responsible for cross-block links or policy enforcement between segments.
