## 5.6.1 – Virtual LANs and Subnets

### 🧱 What VLANs Are:
- VLANs (Virtual LANs) allow separation of devices into different broadcast domains even while connected to the same switch.
- Each VLAN behaves like its own subnet at Layer 2.
- This limits excessive broadcast traffic and improves performance.

### 🧱 Subnets and VLANs:
- At Layer 3, subnetting divides a network into smaller IP networks.
- VLANs can be assigned separate subnets to control traffic and apply routing policies.
- Example VLAN-subnet mappings:
  - VLAN 1 → 10.0.1.0
  - VLAN 2 → 10.0.2.0
  - WAN links → 10.0.3.0, 10.0.4.0
  - Routers B/C local → 10.0.5.0, 10.0.6.0

### ✅ Benefits of VLANs/Subnets:
- Improve traffic management and security by isolating devices.
- Allow separation by department, device type, or traffic sensitivity.
- Help manage performance by grouping similar-performing hosts.

## 5.6.2 – Virtual LAN IDs and Membership

### 🧱 VLAN ID Ranges:
- VLAN IDs: 1–4094
  - 1 = default
  - 2–1001 = normal range ✅
  - 1002–1005 = reserved
  - 1006–4094 = extended range (unsupported by older gear ❌)

### 🧱 VLAN Configuration:
- VLANs are set on **switches**, not routers.
- Each port is manually assigned to a VLAN.
- Example:
  ```bash
  vlan 16
  name VLAN16
  interface range gigabitEthernet 0/1-13
  switchport access vlan 16
```

### 🔄 Inter-VLAN Communication
VLAN traffic can’t communicate directly across VLANs without a **Layer 3 device**—such as a **router** or a **Layer 3 switch**. This is necessary because each VLAN functions like a separate subnet, and routing is required to move packets between subnets.

---

### ✅ VLAN Membership Example

- **VLAN 111 (WiFi):** port `Fa0/1`  
- **VLAN 112 (Wired):** ports `Fa0/2–Fa0/11`  
- **VLAN 113 (VoIP):** ports `Fa0/12–Fa0/19`  
- **VLAN 114 (Embedded):** ports `Fa0/21–Fa0/24`

Each VLAN keeps traffic isolated within its member ports unless Layer 3 routing is configured to bridge communication.

---

### 🧱 VLAN Command Outputs

- `show vlan` – Displays all **configured VLANs** and the **ports assigned** to them.
- VLAN **database mode** is **deprecated** on Cisco switches.
  - Only supports VLAN IDs in the **2–1001 range**
  - Replaced by **global configuration mode**
- To remove a VLAN:
  ```bash
  no vlan [id]
```
