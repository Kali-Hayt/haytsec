## 5.6.6 Default VLAN and Native VLAN

### ‚úÖ Default VLAN
- VLAN ID 1 is the **default VLAN** on all Cisco switches.
- This **cannot be changed**, though you can configure ports to use different VLANs.
- All ports on a new switch default to VLAN 1 unless manually reassigned.
- **Best Practice**: Do **not** use VLAN 1 for user data traffic.
  - It's often used for **inter-switch protocol traffic** (like STP).
  - Leave it empty or reserve it for network management.
- **Security Tip**: Avoid assigning active ports to VLAN 1 to prevent sniffing or accidental leaks.

---

### ‚úÖ Native VLAN
- The **native VLAN** is the VLAN that **accepts untagged frames** on a trunk link.
- By default, the native VLAN is also VLAN 1 ‚Äî but this **can and should be changed**.
- Changing the native VLAN ID helps prevent VLAN hopping attacks.
- Native VLAN must be **configured identically on both ends** of a trunk.
- Used to handle:
  - Legacy devices that don‚Äôt support 802.1Q tagging.
  - Backward compatibility for older switches.

---

### üß± Key Distinctions
- **Default VLAN** = the initial VLAN every port belongs to unless specified.
- **Native VLAN** = where untagged traffic goes **on a trunk**.

---

### üîç Quick Example
- You configure a trunk link between Switch A and Switch B.
- Native VLAN is left at default (1) ‚Üí untagged frames will go to VLAN 1.
- Best practice: Change native VLAN to something like 999, and don‚Äôt use it for traffic.

### ‚úÖ Commands (Cisco IOS)
```bash
show vlan brief               # See VLANs and default assignments
switchport trunk native vlan 999   # Set a secure native VLAN
