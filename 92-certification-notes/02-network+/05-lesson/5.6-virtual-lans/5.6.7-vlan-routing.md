## 5.6.7 VLAN Routing

Many networks use VLANs to segment traffic. But VLANs can't talk to each other without a Layer 3 device (router or Layer 3 switch). Routing between VLANs is required.

### üß± Method 1: Subinterfaces (Router-on-a-Stick)

- Uses **one physical router interface** connected to a trunk port.
- The router interface is split into **subinterfaces**, one per VLAN.
- Each subinterface:
  - Tagged with VLAN ID (802.1Q)
  - Assigned a unique IP address (acts as default gateway for that VLAN)

#### ‚úÖ Example:
```shell
interface G0.16
encapsulation dot1Q 16
ip address 198.51.100.30 255.255.255.240
```
- You can use the first or last available IP for the gateway, by convention.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The router **can** have multiple interfaces. This config is just common, not required.
### üß± Method 2: Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs)

- Used with **Layer 3 switches** for inter-VLAN routing.
- Each VLAN gets a **virtual interface** that acts like a default gateway.
- More scalable than router-on-a-stick for enterprise environments.
- The SVI doesn't use a physical interface ‚Äî it's virtual, tied directly to the VLAN.
#### ‚úÖ Example:
interface VLAN16

ip address 198.51.100.30 255.255.255.240

Hosts in VLAN 16 use this IP as their default gateway.

### üîç Layer 3 Switch Flexibility

- Layer 3 switches can also use **subinterfaces**, like routers.
- Ports can be **routed** (via `no switchport`) instead of switched.
- üß† Key difference:
    - **SVI** = virtual, tied to a VLAN.
    - **Subinterface** = tied to a physical port and VLAN tag.
