## 5.6.1 – Virtual LANs and Subnets

Modern Ethernet networks rely on **switches**, which by default place all connected ports in the **same broadcast domain**.  
This means devices share the same subnet and can communicate using **Layer 2 MAC addressing** and **Layer 3 IP addressing**.

---

### 🧱 VLANs: Virtual LANs (Layer 2)

A **VLAN** allows a switch to separate ports into **distinct broadcast domains**, even if they use the same cabling/switch hardware.

- Configured using **VLAN IDs** on managed switches.
- Each VLAN is treated as a **separate LAN segment**.
- Helps reduce broadcast traffic and improves performance.
- Devices in different VLANs must **communicate through a router**.

---

### 🧱 Subnets: Logical IP Segments (Layer 3)

At Layer 3, **subnetting** divides an IP network into smaller units with unique addresses.

- Each VLAN is typically mapped to a separate **subnet**.
- Subnetting reflects VLAN design in the IP addressing scheme.

#### Example Subnet Design:

- VLANs on Switch A:  
  - `10.0.1.0` and `10.0.2.0`

- WAN serial links (Router A to B and C):  
  - `10.0.3.0` and `10.0.4.0`

- LANs behind Router B and C:  
  - `10.0.5.0` and `10.0.6.0`

### 🧩 Design Benefits of VLANs and Subnets

- 🔗 **Support for multi-site networks**:  
  - WAN links between sites use **distinct subnets**.

- 🛡️ **Security and logical segmentation**:  
  - VLANs group and isolate hosts for **access control**, filtered at the router.

- 🚀 **Performance tuning**:  
  - Devices with similar needs can be grouped to optimize **traffic flow** and **bandwidth use**.
