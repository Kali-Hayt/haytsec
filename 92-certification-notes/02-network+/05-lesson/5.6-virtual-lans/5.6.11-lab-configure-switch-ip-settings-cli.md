## ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step Summary

### 1. Identify SFO Router IP via CDP
- Access Branch1 > Terminal
- Enter EXEC mode:
enable
- Use CDP to discover neighbor info:
show cdp neighbors detail
- Locate the SFO router IP: `192.168.11.254`

---

### 2. Configure Switch IP Address (VLAN 1)
config t  
interface vlan1  
ip address 192.168.11.250 255.255.255.0  
exit

---

### 3. Set Default Gateway
ip default-gateway 192.168.11.254  
exit

---

### 4. Save Config to Startup
copy run start  
[Press Enter again to confirm]

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- `cdp neighbors detail` helps discover directly connected device info (Layer 2).
- VLAN1 must have an IP assigned to enable remote management.
- `default-gateway` command sets the Layer 3 route for traffic leaving the VLAN.
- Saving with `copy run start` ensures config survives reload.
