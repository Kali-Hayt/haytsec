# QUESTION 1

**How are communications between VLANs facilitated?**

- ❌ Through a network firewall  
- ✅ Through an IP router or layer 3 capable switch  
- ❌ By configuring VLANs with the same ID  
- ❌ Through direct connection  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **Through a network firewall**  
  - Firewalls control traffic **between networks**, but they don’t perform **inter-VLAN routing**. You need a Layer 3 device first to make traffic routable.

- ❌ **By configuring VLANs with the same ID**  
  - VLAN IDs are **used to separate** broadcast domains, not connect them. Same IDs don’t magically make them communicate—they just put them in the same VLAN.

- ❌ **Through direct connection**  
  - VLANs are **logical segments**, not physical. Plugging devices in doesn’t let different VLANs talk unless a router or Layer 3 switch routes between them.

🧱 VLANs = Layer 2  
🧱 Routing = Layer 3  
✅ Inter-VLAN = Needs Layer 3 device (Router or L3 Switch)

# QUESTION 2

**Why is it recommended to change the native VLAN from its default setting?**

- ✅ To reduce the risk of VLAN hopping attacks  
- ❌ To increase the speed of the network  
- ❌ To enable inter-VLAN routing  
- ❌ To allow for more VLANs to be created  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **To increase the speed of the network**  
  - Changing the native VLAN has **zero effect on throughput**. It's a **security** measure, not a performance tweak.

- ❌ **To enable inter-VLAN routing**  
  - Inter-VLAN routing needs a **Layer 3 device**, not a native VLAN change.

- ❌ **To allow for more VLANs to be created**  
  - VLAN capacity depends on **switch capability**, not native VLAN settings.

🧱 Native VLAN is untagged by default  
🔍 Attackers can exploit default native VLANs using **VLAN hopping**  
✅ Best practice = change native VLAN to a **non-used, isolated ID**

# QUESTION 3

**In the context of VoIP, what does the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) facilitate?**

- ✅ Automatic assignment of voice VLAN ID to handsets  
- ❌ Conversion of analog voice signals to digital  
- ❌ Encryption of voice traffic  
- ❌ Reduction of latency in voice traffic  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **Conversion of analog voice signals to digital**  
  - That’s the job of a **VoIP codec**, not CDP. CDP doesn’t deal with audio conversion at all.

- ❌ **Encryption of voice traffic**  
  - CDP is a **discovery protocol**, not a security protocol. It’s actually **unencrypted** and often **disabled for security**.

- ❌ **Reduction of latency in voice traffic**  
  - CDP doesn’t affect traffic flow or QoS. That’s handled by **QoS settings**, not discovery protocols.

🧱 CDP = Layer 2 Cisco proprietary protocol  
✅ In VoIP, it helps switches tell phones which VLAN to join  
🎯 CDP talks to Cisco IP phones so they can tag their voice traffic correctly

# QUESTION 4

**A network administrator wants to set up a switch with a voice or auxiliary Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) to distinguish the PC and VoIP traffic without having to set up a trunk port.  
Which of the following commands should the administrator perform first?**

- ❌ switchport voice vlan 101  
- ❌ switchport mode access  
- ✅ interface GigabitEthernet0/0  
- ❌ switchport access vlan 100  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **switchport voice vlan 101**  
  - You **can’t assign VLANs to an interface** unless you’ve **entered interface configuration mode** first. This command must come *after* `interface`.

- ❌ **switchport mode access**  
  - Also must be done *within* the interface context. You can’t use this command globally.

- ❌ **switchport access vlan 100**  
  - Same problem—this command must be executed inside the correct **interface context**.

🧱 Cisco CLI flow =  
1️⃣ `interface GigabitEthernet0/0`  
2️⃣ `switchport mode access`  
3️⃣ `switchport access vlan 100`  
4️⃣ `switchport voice vlan 101`  

🎯 Always start with selecting the interface—everything else hangs off that.

# QUESTION 5

**What is the primary difference between tagged and untagged ports regarding VLAN tags?**

- ❌ Tagged ports add a VLAN tag to all outgoing frames.  
- ✅ Untagged ports do not add or remove VLAN tags from frames within the same VLAN.  
- ❌ Untagged ports can transport traffic for multiple VLANs.  
- ❌ Tagged ports strip VLAN tags from incoming frames.  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **Tagged ports add a VLAN tag to all outgoing frames.**  
  - Not always. Tagged ports add tags **only when needed**, such as when forwarding traffic on **trunk links**.

- ❌ **Untagged ports can transport traffic for multiple VLANs.**  
  - ❌ Incorrect—untagged ports are assigned to **a single VLAN** and cannot handle multiple VLANs like trunk ports can.

- ❌ **Tagged ports strip VLAN tags from incoming frames.**  
  - ❌ No—they **keep VLAN tags intact**. It’s untagged (access) ports that **remove tags** when frames are received.

✅ **Correct Explanation:**  
- Untagged ports are designed for **a single VLAN**, so they **don’t need to modify tags**—they forward traffic within that VLAN as-is.  
- Tagged ports are for **trunking**—they handle **multiple VLANs** by tagging frames as they pass through.  
- VLAN tags help switches determine which VLAN a frame belongs to, but access ports **don’t tag or strip**—they assume all traffic is part of their assigned VLAN.

# QUESTION 6

**Which of the following can you use to create a virtual LAN?**

- ❌ Gateway  
- ❌ Hub  
- ✅ Switch  
- ❌ Router  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **Gateway**  
  - A gateway is for **routing traffic between networks**, not for defining or segmenting local LANs.

- ❌ **Hub**  
  - Hubs are dumb Layer 1 devices. They **don’t support VLANs** or even MAC learning—they just broadcast everything.

- ❌ **Router**  
  - Routers can **route between VLANs**, but they don’t **create** VLANs themselves.

✅ VLANs are created and managed at the **switch level**  
🧱 VLAN = logical segmentation at **Layer 2**, and switches handle Layer 2  
🎯 Modern managed switches allow admins to assign ports to different VLANs

# QUESTION 7

**Which of the following best describes the function of subnetting?**

- ❌ Increasing the broadcast domain size  
- ❌ Physically dividing a network into smaller segments  
- ✅ Logically dividing an IP network into smaller subnetworks  
- ❌ Combining multiple IP networks into a single network  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **Increasing the broadcast domain size**  
  - Subnetting actually **reduces** broadcast domain size by **breaking a large network into smaller segments**.

- ❌ **Physically dividing a network into smaller segments**  
  - That’s a **Layer 1 or Layer 2** concept. Subnetting is a **Layer 3 (IP)** logical process.

- ❌ **Combining multiple IP networks into a single network**  
  - That’s **supernetting**, not subnetting. Subnetting does the **opposite**—it breaks a network into pieces.

✅ Subnetting = Logical segmentation of an IP address space  
🧱 Subnets allow for:
- Improved IP utilization  
- Reduced broadcast traffic  
- Easier routing control

# QUESTION 8

**What is the primary purpose of trunking in a network?**

- ❌ To increase the security of the network  
- ✅ To interconnect multiple switches and build the network fabric  
- ❌ To connect a computer to the Internet  
- ❌ To replace wireless connections with wired connections  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **To increase the security of the network**  
  - Trunking is about **carrying VLAN traffic**, not securing it. If anything, misconfigured trunks can introduce **VLAN hopping risks**.

- ❌ **To connect a computer to the Internet**  
  - That’s the job of **default gateways and routers**, not trunks. Trunks don’t usually connect end devices.

- ❌ **To replace wireless connections with wired connections**  
  - That’s not trunking—that’s just switching from Wi-Fi to Ethernet. Totally unrelated to VLANs.

✅ Trunk ports carry **multiple VLANs’ traffic** between switches  
🧱 They’re essential for building multi-switch, multi-VLAN topologies  
🎯 Think of trunks as the **backbone highways** that let VLANs span multiple switches

# QUESTION 9

**What is the default VLAN ID on a switch?**

- ❌ 4094  
- ❌ 1001  
- ❌ 0  
- ✅ 1  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **4094**  
  - This is the **highest usable VLAN ID**, not the default. Often reserved or special use depending on the switch.

- ❌ **1001**  
  - This is in the **extended VLAN range** (1006–4094), not used by default unless manually configured.

- ❌ **0**  
  - VLAN 0 is technically used to indicate **priority tagging** (802.1p) but not to assign actual VLAN membership.

✅ VLAN 1 is the **default VLAN**  
- All switch ports are assigned to VLAN 1 by default  
- Control protocols like CDP and STP often run on VLAN 1  
🎯 Best practice: don’t use VLAN 1 for user traffic—segment it!

# QUESTION 10

**What is a "router on a stick"?**

- ❌ A wireless router used exclusively for VLAN traffic  
- ✅ A router with a single interface connected to a trunk port on the switch  
- ❌ A router with multiple physical interfaces, each connected to a separate VLAN  
- ❌ A virtual router implemented within a Layer 3 switch  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **A wireless router used exclusively for VLAN traffic**  
  - Totally off. Has nothing to do with wireless—this is about **routing VLANs through a single interface**.

- ❌ **A router with multiple physical interfaces, each connected to a separate VLAN**  
  - That’s an **old-school or legacy setup**, not “router on a stick.” This method burns hardware ports unnecessarily.

- ❌ **A virtual router implemented within a Layer 3 switch**  
  - That describes **SVI (Switched Virtual Interface)** or **Layer 3 switching**, not router-on-a-stick.

✅ "Router on a stick" =  
- One router interface  
- Connected to a **trunk port** on the switch  
- Uses **subinterfaces**, each tagged for a VLAN  
🎯 Efficient way to route between VLANs using **minimal hardware**
