### üß± Overview  
Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as Network Address Port Translation (NAPT), enables multiple private IP addresses to share a single public IP. It's especially useful for small companies with a limited pool of public IPs.

- PAT is a variant of NAT that maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP by using **port numbers**.
- Alternate names: **NAT Overloading**, **One-to-Many NAT**, **Many-to-One NAT**, **NAT Masquerade**.

---

### üß± How PAT Works  
PAT dynamically assigns a unique **Transport Layer port ID** for each connection:

Example:  
- Host A (10.0.0.101) opens a connection: mapped to `10.0.0.101:61101`  
- Host B (10.0.0.102) opens a connection: mapped to `10.0.0.102:61102`  
- Both requests are NAT-ed through the same public IP but **different ports**.

The PAT device:  
- Records mappings in a **state table**.  
- Replaces internal IP:port with public IP:unique port.  
- When replies return, it matches incoming packets back to the correct internal host using the port number.

### ‚úÖ Key Advantages  
- Efficient use of limited public IPs  
- Supports **multiple concurrent sessions**  
- Automatically manages connections

### üîç Real-World Analogy  
PAT is like a receptionist managing outgoing mail from many employees using one shared return address‚Äîeach envelope has a unique internal ID so replies go to the right person.
