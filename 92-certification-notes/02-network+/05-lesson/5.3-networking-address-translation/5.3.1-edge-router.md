# Edge Routers

## 🧱 What Is an Edge Router?

- An **edge router** connects an internal network to an **external network** (usually the Internet or WAN).
- Positioned at the **boundary of a network** — think of it as the **gatekeeper**.
- Often referred to as a **Customer Edge (CE) router** when dealing with ISPs.
- May also be a **Provider Edge (PE) router** if it sits on the ISP's end.

---

## 🛰️ Key Functions

- **Routes between LAN and WAN**: Supports multiple routing protocols for both environments.
- **Manages WAN protocols**: Supports encapsulations like Frame Relay, MPLS, or PPP.
- **Applies policies**: Enforces **access control**, **QoS**, **NAT**, and **firewall rules**.
- Can include **VPN capabilities** for secure remote connectivity.

---

## 💡 Characteristics

- ✅ Usually optimized for **high throughput** and **packet processing**.
- ✅ Often includes **redundant hardware** (power, interfaces).
- ✅ May offload traffic to **dedicated security appliances** or **cloud services**.
- ❌ Not typically involved in internal LAN routing — that’s for core/distribution routers.

---

## 🔐 Role in Security

- First line of **defense** against external threats.
- Works with firewalls to **filter ingress/egress traffic**.
- Applies **traffic shaping**, **monitoring**, and **logging** to edge flows.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Edge routers = **network perimeter** routers.
- Handle **routing**, **policy enforcement**, and **WAN access**.
- Critical in **enterprise** and **ISP-grade networks**.
