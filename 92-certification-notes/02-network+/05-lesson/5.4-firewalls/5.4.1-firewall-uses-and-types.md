## 5.4.1 – Firewall Uses and Types

### 🔥 What Firewalls Do  
The basic function of a firewall is **traffic filtering**. It blocks traffic that does not conform to a rule.  
There are many types of firewalls and ways to implement them:

- Some protect the **whole network** (inline).
- Some protect a **single host** (installed locally).
- Firewalls also vary by **which part of the packet** they inspect.

### 🧱 Packet Filtering Firewalls  
This is the earliest type of firewall. It uses a list of rules (ACLs) to control traffic. Works at **OSI Layer 3**.

- **IP Filtering** — Accept/Deny by source/destination IP.
- **Protocol ID/Type** — TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
- **Port Filtering/Security** — Accept/Deny based on Layer 4 port numbers.

> 💡 *Even though it uses port info (Layer 4), it’s still considered a Layer 3 firewall since it doesn't inspect deeper.*

### 🔍 ACLs and Stateless Design  
- ACLs can filter **inbound**, **outbound**, or both (ingress/egress).
- Useful for blocking unauthorized apps, malware, or backdoors.
- Stateless: doesn’t track sessions. Each packet is filtered independently.
- ✅ Less processing load  
- ❌ Vulnerable to multi-packet attacks  
- ❌ Issues with dynamic ports, load balancing

### 🔄 Stateful Inspection Firewalls  
This type tracks **sessions** between hosts.  
It works at **OSI Layer 5 (Session)** and uses a **dynamic state table**.

- Checks if packet belongs to an active connection.
- If not, reverts to packet filtering rules.
- If yes, allows traffic without further checks (conserves resources).
