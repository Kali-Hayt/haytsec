# QUESTION 1  
Which of the following best describes packet filtering firewalls?

✅ They inspect the headers of IP packets and filter based on rules.  
❌ They only filter outgoing traffic from a network.  
❌ They inspect the content of each data packet.  
❌ They encrypt each data packet.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *They only filter outgoing traffic from a network.*  
  → Packet filters work on **both inbound and outbound** traffic based on rules like IP, port, and protocol—not just outgoing traffic.

- ❌ *They inspect the content of each data packet.*  
  → That’s what a **deep packet inspection (DPI)** or **application-layer firewall** might do. Packet filters only look at headers (IP, port, protocol), not payloads.

- ❌ *They encrypt each data packet.*  
  → Firewalls don’t **encrypt** data. That’s a function of VPNs, TLS, or other encryption protocols—not packet filtering firewalls.

# QUESTION 2  
What is a key difference between an appliance firewall and a router firewall?

❌ A router firewall cannot monitor traffic.  
❌ A router firewall is not a hardware-based solution.  
✅ An appliance firewall performs only the function of a firewall.  
❌ An appliance firewall can handle more traffic.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *A router firewall cannot monitor traffic.*  
  → Incorrect. Router firewalls **can monitor traffic** as part of their built-in features—just not as specialized or deeply as dedicated appliances.

- ❌ *A router firewall is not a hardware-based solution.*  
  → Wrong. Router firewalls are absolutely hardware-based—they just combine routing and firewalling in one device.

- ❌ *An appliance firewall can handle more traffic.*  
  → This might **seem** true, but it’s not the **key** difference. It's about **dedication to firewalling**, not throughput. In fact, some high-end routers outperform budget appliances.

# QUESTION 3  
What is a characteristic of an enterprise-class router firewall compared to a SOHO router firewall?

❌ It supports fewer sessions.  
❌ It is less secure.  
✅ It can support far more sessions.  
❌ It is cheaper.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *It supports fewer sessions.*  
  → Enterprise gear is designed to handle **massive amounts of concurrent sessions**—thousands or even millions—unlike SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) gear.

- ❌ *It is less secure.*  
  → False. If anything, enterprise firewalls offer **more advanced and granular security** options—like custom rule sets, deep inspection, and integration with SIEM.

- ❌ *It is cheaper.*  
  → Ha, not by a long shot. Enterprise firewalls are way more expensive due to performance, scalability, and support. Think *big budget, big capabilities*.

# QUESTION 4  
What does a stateful inspection firewall do that a stateless firewall does not?

❌ Encrypts data packets  
❌ Filters traffic based solely on IP addresses  
✅ Maintains stateful information about the session established between two hosts  
❌ Operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Encrypts data packets*  
  → Nope. Encryption is the job of protocols like IPSec, TLS, or VPNs—not firewalls themselves. Firewalls inspect and filter, not encrypt.

- ❌ *Filters traffic based solely on IP addresses*  
  → That’s actually what **stateless** firewalls do. They inspect individual packets without context—IP, port, and protocol only.

- ❌ *Operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model*  
  → State-aware firewalls work at **Layer 3 (Network)** and **Layer 4 (Transport)**. Layer 2 is the domain of switches, MAC addresses, and Ethernet frames.

# QUESTION 5  
What does ingress and egress traffic filtering refer to?

❌ Encrypting data entering and leaving a network  
❌ Monitoring internet usage and bandwidth  
✅ Controlling both inbound and outbound network traffic  
❌ Filtering both internal and external emails  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Encrypting data entering and leaving a network*  
  → Encryption ≠ filtering. Ingress/egress filtering is about **allowing or blocking** traffic—not encoding it for confidentiality.

- ❌ *Monitoring internet usage and bandwidth*  
  → That’s **network monitoring**, not traffic filtering. Think of filtering as **gatekeeping**, not observing.

- ❌ *Filtering both internal and external emails*  
  → Email filtering is more **content-based** (spam, malware, keywords), not the broader concept of traffic control across the **network perimeter**.
