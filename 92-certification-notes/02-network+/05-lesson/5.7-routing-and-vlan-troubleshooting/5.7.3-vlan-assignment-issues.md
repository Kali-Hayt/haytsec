## 5.7.3 VLAN Assignment Issues

### üß± VLAN Basics

When you configure a VLAN:
- Each assigned **switch port** belongs to a **separate broadcast domain**
- Each VLAN usually has its **own subnet**
- Devices in that VLAN need proper:
  - IP address
  - Subnet mask
  - Default gateway
  - DNS server

‚û°Ô∏è Devices in a VLAN must use the **router** (default gateway) to reach:
- Other VLANs  
- Remote networks

---

### üåê Default Gateway Setup

The router for a VLAN is often implemented using a **virtual interface**:

- If a **router** is used:
  - It will use **subinterfaces** (e.g., `interface G0.16`) over a **trunk link**

- If a **Layer 3 switch** is used:
  - It will use an **SVI (Switched Virtual Interface)** like `interface VLAN16`

Use `show` commands to:
- Confirm IP/gateway config  
- Check VLAN port assignments

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Physical Issues

If a host is assigned to the wrong VLAN even though the config appears correct:
- Suspect **cabling issues**
- Trace patch panel connections
- Ensure correct port is labeled and patched from wall jack to switch

### ‚úÖ Connectivity Troubleshooting with Ping

1. **Loopback / self ping**  
   - Verify TCP/IP stack is up  
   - Confirms host IP config

2. **Ping default gateway**  
   - If failed, check host config or switch/router VLAN settings  
   - Try another host on the same VLAN to confirm if it‚Äôs local or upstream

3. **Ping remote host**  
   - Verifies inter-VLAN or WAN routing  
   - Use `traceroute` if some hosts work and others don‚Äôt

### üîÑ VLAN ‚Üí DHCP & DNS Reachability

Each VLAN must be able to access:
- **DHCP server**
- **DNS server**

Options:
- Put DHCP/DNS **inside the VLAN**  
- Or use **DHCP relay** to forward requests to a server in a different VLAN (most common)

üß± Without DHCP or DNS access, host bootstrapping and name resolution will fail.
