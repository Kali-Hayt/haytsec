## 5.7.2 Default Route and Routing Loop Issues

### 🌐 Default Route Basics

Every end host needs a **default gateway** to reach remote networks.

The host's routing table should include:

```
0.0.0.0/0 → [gateway IP address]
```

If that’s missing:
- Confirm the default gateway is configured correctly.
- Try pinging the gateway.
- Check if the router is **up** and **interfaces are working**.

❗ If one interface is down or config is wrong, **multiple hosts may lose connectivity**.

Routers also use default routes—typically pointing to an upstream provider (e.g., ISP).  
Misconfigured defaults can **create routing loops** or block external access.

### 🔁 Routing Loop Defined

A **routing loop** happens when **two routers forward traffic to each other**, each thinking the other is the path to the destination.

Symptoms:
- Packets circulate endlessly until **TTL expires**
- Routers generate **ICMP Time Exceeded** messages

### 🧱 Loop Prevention Mechanisms (Distance Vector Protocols)

- **Maximum hop count**  
  If a route exceeds a max hop (e.g., 16 in RIP), it’s marked unreachable  
  - Hop count 16 = poison route (explicit failure notice)

- **Holddown timer**  
  When a route is declared unreachable:  
  - Neighbors suppress updates about that route for a set time  
  - Prevents accepting false updates before convergence

- **Split horizon**  
  Prevents a route learned from a neighbor from being advertised **back to that neighbor**  
  - Stops loops like: A → B → A → B...

### 🧠 Link-State Loop Behavior

Link-state protocols (like OSPF):
- Use **flooding updates** to keep all nodes synced  
- A loop indicates a **failure in update propagation**  
  - Could mean some routers have outdated or inconsistent topology data

### 🛠️ Detecting Loops

Use `traceroute`:
- Look for **IP addresses repeating** in the path  
- Repeated hops = likely sign of a loop
