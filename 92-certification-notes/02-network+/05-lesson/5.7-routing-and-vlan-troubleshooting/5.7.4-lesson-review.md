# QUESTION 1

**What must be configured if DHCP services are located in a different VLAN from the client devices?**

- ❌ A direct physical connection between VLANs  
- ❌ A unique DNS server for each VLAN  
- ✅ A DHCP relay  
- ❌ A static route on the DHCP server  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **A direct physical connection between VLANs**  
  - VLANs are segmented by design. You don't need a physical link—just **routing and relaying**.

- ❌ **A unique DNS server for each VLAN**  
  - DNS isn’t tied to VLANs this way. Clients from any VLAN can query the same DNS if it’s reachable.

- ❌ **A static route on the DHCP server**  
  - The DHCP server doesn’t need to route to every subnet—it just needs to receive **forwarded requests** via a relay.

✅ **A DHCP relay agent** (configured on the router or Layer 3 switch):
- Forwards broadcast DHCPDISCOVER messages to the DHCP server in another VLAN  
- Uses the `ip helper-address` command in Cisco environments

🧠 DHCP = broadcast-based → doesn’t cross VLANs without help
🎯 Solution: DHCP relay bridges that gap

# QUESTION 2

**What does the split horizon mechanism prevent in routing protocols?**

- ❌ The use of a default gateway  
- ❌ The configuration of static routes  
- ❌ The propagation of routing loops through increased hop counts  
- ✅ A router from advertising a route back to the router from which it was learned  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **The use of a default gateway**  
  - Default gateways are unrelated to split horizon. That’s an IP configuration concept, not routing loop prevention.

- ❌ **The configuration of static routes**  
  - Split horizon only applies to **dynamic routing protocols**—static routes are manually set and not exchanged via advertisements.

- ❌ **The propagation of routing loops through increased hop counts**  
  - That’s **maximum hop count** or **poison reverse**, not split horizon.

✅ **Split horizon** prevents a router from saying:  
“I learned about this network from you… and now I’m telling you about it.”  
That stops loops from forming between two routers echoing routes at each other.

🧱 Classic distance vector loop protection mechanism  
🧠 Especially used in RIP and EIGRP

# QUESTION 3

**What is the preferred route selection when there are paths to the same destination with different prefix lengths?**

- ✅ The path with the longest prefix length  
- ❌ The path with the highest administrative distance  
- ❌ The path with the shortest prefix length  
- ❌ The path with the highest metric value  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **The path with the highest administrative distance**  
  - Higher AD = **less trustworthy**. Routers prefer the **lowest** AD value when comparing different sources (e.g., static vs OSPF).

- ❌ **The path with the shortest prefix length**  
  - A shorter prefix is **less specific**. Routing prefers **more specific matches**, not broader ones.

- ❌ **The path with the highest metric value**  
  - A **higher metric** means **less preferred**. Metrics represent path cost—lower is better.

✅ **Longest prefix match wins**  
- `/28` is preferred over `/24`  
- The more bits match the destination, the more precise the route

🧠 This rule takes precedence over AD or metric—**specificity wins first**

# QUESTION 4

**What is the primary purpose of establishing the scope of a VLAN assignment issue?**

- ❌ To configure the default gateway for all VLANs  
- ✅ To identify the specific problem and its impact on the network  
- ❌ To assign IP addresses to all devices in the network  
- ❌ To determine the number of VLANs in the network  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **To configure the default gateway for all VLANs**  
  - That’s part of VLAN setup, but not related to **scope analysis** during troubleshooting.

- ❌ **To assign IP addresses to all devices in the network**  
  - IP addressing is part of provisioning—not what you're doing when trying to **diagnose** an issue.

- ❌ **To determine the number of VLANs in the network**  
  - Knowing how many VLANs exist doesn’t help unless you know **which are impacted**.

✅ The goal is to:
- **Narrow down the issue**
- Identify whether it affects **a single VLAN**, **multiple VLANs**, or **the entire switch/router**
- Focus your troubleshooting effort based on **impact**

🎯 Scope first → fix faster

# QUESTION 5

**What is the effect of a poison route in distance vector routing protocols?**

- ✅ It advertises a route with a hop count of 16 to indicate the network is unreachable.  
- ❌ It increases the hop count to the maximum to speed up convergence.  
- ❌ It decreases the hop count to zero to indicate the network is directly connected.  
- ❌ It advertises a route with a hop count of 16 to indicate the network is reachable.  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **It increases the hop count to the maximum to speed up convergence.**  
  - Hop count is raised to **mark the route as unreachable**, not to "speed anything up."

- ❌ **It decreases the hop count to zero to indicate the network is directly connected.**  
  - Directly connected routes do have a hop count of 0—but poison routes are about **invalidating paths**, not confirming them.

- ❌ **It advertises a route with a hop count of 16 to indicate the network is reachable.**  
  - This is backward—**16 in RIP = unreachable**.

✅ Poison routing is a **loop prevention** method used in **RIP**:  
- Hop count of 16 = "dead route"  
- All routers that hear the update **flush that route**

🎯 It's a loud and clear "don’t go there anymore"

# QUESTION 6

**What factor is considered when there are identical paths with equal administrative distances to a destination?**

- ❌ The path with the highest metric value  
- ❌ The path with the most recent update  
- ✅ The path with the lowest metric value  
- ❌ The path with the shortest prefix length  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **The path with the highest metric value**  
  - Higher metric = higher cost = **less preferred**. We want **lower**, not higher.

- ❌ **The path with the most recent update**  
  - Update time doesn’t influence route selection unless dealing with **route flapping or instability**.

- ❌ **The path with the shortest prefix length**  
  - Prefix length matters **first** in selection—but in this case, we’re told the prefix and AD are **already equal**.

✅ When prefix and AD are equal, the router compares the **metric**:  
- Lower metric = lower cost = better path  
- Metrics are protocol-specific:
  - RIP = hop count  
  - OSPF = bandwidth  
  - EIGRP = delay, bandwidth, reliability, load, etc.

🎯 It’s about **efficiency**, not age or randomness

# QUESTION 7

**What should be verified if you cannot ping any remote hosts during VLAN troubleshooting?**

- ❌ That the host's firewall is disabled  
- ❌ The subnet mask of all devices in the VLAN  
- ✅ The switch and router configuration  
- ❌ That all devices have static IP addresses  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **That the host's firewall is disabled**  
  - Firewalls could block **incoming pings**, but here the issue is **network-wide**, not isolated to a single host.

- ❌ **The subnet mask of all devices in the VLAN**  
  - While important for **local VLAN communication**, it won’t stop **remote VLAN access**—that’s a routing issue.

- ❌ **That all devices have static IP addresses**  
  - Networks can (and often do) use **DHCP**. Static IPs aren’t required across the board.

✅ If **no remote pings work**, you likely have a **routing or trunking problem**:  
- Misconfigured SVI or default gateway  
- Wrong VLAN assignment on trunk  
- Missing inter-VLAN routing setup

🎯 Focus on the **network gear**, not the endpoints

# QUESTION 8

**If you can ping a host's default gateway but cannot ping hosts on remote networks, what should you suspect?**

- ❌ A firewall issue  
- ❌ A cable disconnection  
- ✅ A routing issue  
- ❌ A DNS issue  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **A firewall issue**  
  - You’re already getting responses from the default gateway—if a firewall was blocking all traffic, **even that wouldn’t work**.

- ❌ **A cable disconnection**  
  - You wouldn’t be able to ping **anything**, including the default gateway, if the cable were disconnected.

- ❌ **A DNS issue**  
  - DNS resolves *names* to IPs. You’re pinging IPs and still failing to reach them—**not a DNS problem**.

✅ This screams **routing issue**. You can talk to your gateway (first hop), but **the router doesn’t know where to go next**, or there’s a **missing or incorrect route to the destination network**. Time to check the routing table!

# QUESTION 9

**What is a symptom of a routing loop?**

✅ ICMP Time Exceeded error messages  
❌ Decreased CPU usage on routers  
❌ Increased bandwidth availability  
❌ Decreased network latency  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **Decreased CPU usage on routers**  
  - Routing loops do the opposite—they **hammer CPU and memory** with repeated processing of the same packets.

- ❌ **Increased bandwidth availability**  
  - Routing loops flood the network with unnecessary traffic, **wasting bandwidth** and crowding the pipes.

- ❌ **Decreased network latency**  
  - Nope. Loops cause packets to circle until TTL drops to zero, **skyrocketing latency** and causing massive delays.

✅ When TTL hits zero after bouncing through too many hops, routers respond with **ICMP Time Exceeded**—classic routing loop red flag.

# QUESTION 10

**What is the first step in diagnosing VLAN assignment issues using ping?**

✅ Ping the loopback address, then the host's own IP address.  
❌ Ping another host on the same VLAN/subnet.  
❌ Ping the default gateway.  
❌ Ping a remote host or server.  

**Why the others are wrong:**

- ❌ **Ping another host on the same VLAN/subnet**  
  - You're jumping ahead. First confirm that the local machine can talk to *itself*—*then* test the neighborhood.

- ❌ **Ping the default gateway**  
  - Useful, yes—but only *after* verifying local TCP/IP stack functionality. Gateway ping is **step 2**.

- ❌ **Ping a remote host or server**  
  - That's way down the chain. If local IP or routing is broken, this will fail and tell you nothing useful.

✅ First verify the basics:
1. **Loopback** = is TCP/IP even working at all?
2. **Own IP** = is it properly configured on the interface?

Only after those succeed do you move on to gateway and remote connectivity.
