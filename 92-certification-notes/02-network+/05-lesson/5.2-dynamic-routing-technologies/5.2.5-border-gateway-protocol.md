# 5.2.5  
# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

## Overview  
- ✅ **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** is the **routing protocol of the Internet**.
- It is used **between autonomous systems (AS)**—like between ISPs or large organizations.
- BGP supports **mesh internetworks** and is **path vector–based**, not distance or link state.
- Prioritizes **stability over speed**. Convergence is **slow but deliberate**.

## 🧱 Core Concepts

| Feature           | BGP                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Protocol Type     | Path Vector                           |
| Scope             | Between Autonomous Systems (AS)       |
| Protocol Port     | ✅ TCP 179                             |
| Addressing        | Classless, uses **NLRI**              |
| Metric Factors    | Hop count, weight, local preference, origin, community |
| Goal              | Stability, policy-based routing       |
| Transport Method  | ✅ TCP (unlike OSPF/EIGRP using IP)   |

## 🛰️ Autonomous Systems (AS)

- An **AS** is a group of routers under a single administrative domain.
- BGP routers exchange **AS-level reachability** — not every subnet inside the AS.
- Prevents **Internet-wide flooding** of internal routes.

🧠 BGP only shares what is **necessary** — keeping global routing tables **manageable**.

- Each AS is assigned a unique **ASN (Autonomous System Number)** by IANA via regional registries.
- Routers in one AS talk to routers in another AS via BGP, sharing **AS paths**.

---

## 🌍 Internet Backbone Behavior

- EIGRP and OSPF handle **intra-domain** (inside AS) routing.
- BGP handles **inter-domain** (between ASes) routing.
- Path selection is **policy-driven**, not shortest-path.

### ✅ BGP can:
- Enforce **routing policies**
- Prefer one ISP over another
- Prevent specific prefixes from propagating
- Control traffic entering or leaving your network

---

## 🔁 Metrics & Route Decision

BGP chooses best path using **multiple attributes**, including:

- **AS Path** — Shortest chain of ASNs (like hop count).
- **Weight** — Cisco proprietary, preferred if higher.
- **Local Preference** — Higher = preferred path.
- **Origin** — How the route was learned (IGP > EGP > incomplete).
- **Community** — Tags for group policy.

---

## ⚠️ Strengths & Weaknesses

### ✅ Strengths
- Built for **scalability** — backbone of the Internet.
- **Highly customizable routing policies**.
- Designed for **control** and **stability**.

### ❌ Weaknesses
- **Slow to converge** (not built for real-time agility).
- **Complex configuration**.
- Doesn’t care about bandwidth or delay — not performance-optimized.

---

## Summary

- ✅ BGP = **the glue of the Internet** — used by ISPs to route globally.
- ✅ Policy-based routing between ASes.
- ✅ Uses **TCP port 179** for reliable delivery.
- ✅ Makes routing decisions using **NLRI + path attributes**.
- ❌ Slower convergence — not built for speed.
