# QUESTION 1  
What happens when a routing protocol's database contains more than one route to the same destination prefix?

✅ The path with the lowest cost metric is used.  
❌ The router selects the route with the highest cost metric.  
❌ The router randomly selects one of the routes for use.  
❌ All routes are used simultaneously to balance the load.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Highest cost metric**: That’s the *least* desirable route. Protocols choose the most efficient path.  
- ❌ **Random selection**: Routing is deterministic, not random.  
- ❌ **All routes used**: That’s load balancing, and it’s not automatic unless specifically configured.

# QUESTION 2  
What is the principal difference between link state and distance vector protocols?

✅ Link state protocols allow each node to hold a copy of the complete network topology.  
❌ Distance vector protocols use a shortest path first algorithm.  
❌ Distance vector protocols allow each node to hold a copy of the complete network topology.  
❌ Link state protocols rely on directly connected neighbors for information about remote networks.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Shortest path first algorithm**: That’s used by link-state protocols (like OSPF), not distance vector.  
- ❌ **Distance vector holds full topology**: Nope — they rely on neighbor updates only (rumor-style).  
- ❌ **Link state relies on neighbors**: That’s a distance vector behavior — link state builds a full map.

# QUESTION 3  
What was the primary reason for the development of Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP)?

✅ To address limitations in IGRP, such as lack of support for classless addressing  
❌ To provide a routing protocol for inter-domain routing  
❌ To improve the security features of routing protocols  
❌ To replace the TCP/IP protocol  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Inter-domain routing**: That’s BGP’s job — EIGRP is still an **interior gateway protocol**.  
- ❌ **Security improvements**: Not the core goal — EIGRP focused on flexibility and performance, not encryption.  
- ❌ **Replace TCP/IP**: That's not even in the scope of EIGRP — it *runs on* IP, not instead of it.

🧱 EIGRP was created to fix IGRP’s limitations — especially the need for **classless routing** (CIDR).

# QUESTION 4  
In RIP, what happens when a router receives an update that includes a route to a network it already knows about?

✅ It replaces its existing route with the new one only if the hop count is lower.  
❌ It ignores the update.  
❌ It always replaces its existing route with the new one.  
❌ It increments the hop count of its existing route by 1.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Ignores the update**: RIP always evaluates updates — it doesn’t blindly discard them.  
- ❌ **Always replaces the route**: No — it checks if the new route is *better* (lower hop count).  
- ❌ **Increments the hop count of its own route**: That’s what it does when *advertising* a route — not when receiving one.

🧱 RIP = distance vector. It’s all about picking the path with the **lowest hop count**.

# QUESTION 5  
What can cause convergence problems in a dynamic routing network?

✅ A flapping interface  
❌ Consistent routing information across all routers  
❌ A stable network with no changes  
❌ The use of static routing protocols  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Consistent routing info**: That’s the *goal* — not a problem.  
- ❌ **Stable network**: If nothing's changing, there's no convergence to worry about.  
- ❌ **Static routing**: Static routes don’t rely on convergence at all — they’re manually configured.

🧱 Flapping = when an interface keeps going up and down. This triggers **constant recalculation**, causing instability and delay in reaching convergence.

# QUESTION 6  
If a router has two routes to the same destination with identical prefix lengths from the same routing protocol, how does it choose which route to use?

✅ By choosing the route with the lowest metric  
❌ By preferring the route with the shortest prefix  
❌ By selecting the route with the largest packet size  
❌ By using the Administrative Distance (AD) value  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Shortest prefix**: That’s the *opposite* — longer prefixes are preferred (more specific).  
- ❌ **Packet size**: Packet size isn’t a routing decision factor.  
- ❌ **AD value**: AD is only used to choose between *different routing protocols*, not within the same one.

🧱 Within the same protocol and same prefix length, the **metric** is what matters. Lower = better.

# QUESTION 7  
What is the purpose of the hello messaging in EIGRP?

✅ To confirm connectivity with its neighbors  
❌ To encrypt data packets  
❌ To transmit routing updates  
❌ To assign IP addresses to routers  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Encrypt data packets**: That’s not hello messaging’s role — encryption is a separate feature.  
- ❌ **Transmit routing updates**: Hello packets don’t carry routes — they’re for neighbor discovery and status.  
- ❌ **Assign IPs**: IP addressing happens manually or via DHCP, not EIGRP hello messages.

🧱 EIGRP hello packets = “Are you still there?” checks between routers to maintain **neighbor adjacency**.

# QUESTION 8  
What protocol does BGP use for its operation?

✅ TCP  
❌ ICMP  
❌ UDP  
❌ ARP  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **ICMP**: Used for diagnostics (e.g., ping), not routing.  
- ❌ **UDP**: Used by protocols like RIP, not BGP.  
- ❌ **ARP**: Resolves MAC addresses, not used in BGP communication.

🧱 BGP uses **TCP port 179** for reliable delivery of routing updates between autonomous systems.

---
# QUESTION 9  
What type of routing system is OSPF considered to be?

✅ Hierarchical  
❌ Linear  
❌ Circular  
❌ Flat  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Linear**: No such routing architecture — networks don’t route like a straight line.  
- ❌ **Circular**: That would cause endless loops — OSPF is loop-preventing.  
- ❌ **Flat**: EIGRP is flat. OSPF is designed to scale using **areas**, including Area 0 (the backbone).

🧱 OSPF organizes networks into **areas**, forming a clear **hierarchy** that improves scalability and performance.

# QUESTION 10  
Under which of the following circumstances might you implement BGP on your company network and share routes with internet routers?

✅ If the network is connected to the Internet using multiple ISPs  
❌ If the network is connected to the Internet using public addressing  
❌ If the network has over 15 areas and uses IPv6  
❌ If the network has over 15 hops  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Public addressing**: That alone doesn’t require BGP; even small networks use public IPs with NAT.  
- ❌ **15 areas and IPv6**: BGP doesn’t care about internal OSPF/IPv6 structures — it’s about **external routing** between autonomous systems.  
- ❌ **15 hops**: Sounds like RIP’s limit. BGP is for policy-based routing, not hop count thresholds.

🧱 BGP is for **multi-homing** — connecting to **multiple ISPs** and controlling route advertisements on the public Internet.
