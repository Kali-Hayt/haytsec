# 5.2.6  
# Route Selection

## 🧠 Longest Prefix Match  
- When a router has multiple entries for similar destinations, it picks the one with the **longest and most specific prefix**.
- Example:
198.51.100.0/24 via g0  
198.51.100.0/28 via g1

- ✅ A packet to `198.51.100.1` uses **g1** because `/28` is more specific than `/24`.

---

## 📏 Route Selection Logic

- Each routing protocol contributes **one route per destination** to the routing table.
- If **prefix lengths are equal**, router uses the **routing protocol's metric** to choose the best.
- But protocols use different metrics (e.g., EIGRP = bandwidth/delay, RIP = hop count), so they **can’t be compared directly**.

---

## 🎖️ Administrative Distance (AD)

- AD = **trust level** of a routing source.
- Lower AD = more trusted.
- Used **only when prefix lengths are equal** and **from different routing protocols**.

### 🔢 Default AD Values

| Source                            | AD   |
|----------------------------------|------|
| ✅ Directly connected             | 0    |
| ✅ Static route                   | 1    |
| BGP                              | 20   |
| EIGRP                            | 90   |
| OSPF                             | 110  |
| RIP                              | 120  |
| ❌ Unknown                        | 255 (never used) |

---

## 💡 Examples

- A static route will beat RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP if prefix length is equal.
- A learned EIGRP route will be preferred over an OSPF route to the same network.
- A **high-AD static route** (e.g. AD 200) could be a **backup** if the dynamic route fails.
