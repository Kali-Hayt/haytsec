### ðŸ§± What Is a Dynamic Routing Protocol?  
- Uses an **algorithm** and **metrics** to automatically build and maintain a **routing information base**.  
- Prioritizes best path using metrics (e.g., hops, bandwidth, delay).  
- **Learns** routes from other routers and shares routes with neighbors.  
- Populates the IP routing table with **learned routes**.

### ðŸ§­ Topology and Metrics  

- **Routing protocols** use **algorithms** to determine optimal or least-cost paths.  
- Most protocols are either:  
  - `Distance Vector`
