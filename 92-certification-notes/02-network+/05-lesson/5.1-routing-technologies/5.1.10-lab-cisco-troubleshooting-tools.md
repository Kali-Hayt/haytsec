## 🛠️ Lab: Cisco Troubleshooting Tools (5.1.10)

As a network administrator, your job here is to troubleshoot routing issues using key Cisco IOS commands. You'll use real CLI tools to validate configurations, identify neighbors, and check path viability.

---

### ✅ Commands Practiced

- `enable` or `en` — Elevate to privileged EXEC mode  
- `show version` or `sh ver` — IOS version  
- `show interfaces` or `sh int` — Interface statuses  
- `show startup-config` or `sh start` — Saved config  
- `show running-config` or `sh run` — Active config  
- `show cdp neighbors` or `sh cdp ne` — Neighbor discovery  
- `ping 192.168.11.1` — Connectivity to Workstation  
- `traceroute 172.17.12.97` — Path from Branch1 to LAX

### 🔍 Summary of Tasks

1. **SFO Router CLI Access**
   - `enable` mode
   - Verified `IOS version`: **12.4(10a)** ✅
   - Checked interfaces: **2 FastEthernet, 4 Serial** ✅
   - VPN module installed: ✅ `True`

2. **Interface & IP Check**
   - `Serial0/1/0` status: ✅ `up`
   - `FastEthernet0/0` IP: ✅ `192.168.11.254`
   - `FastEthernet0/0` & `0/1` both have IPs? ❌ `False` (Only one assigned)

3. **Neighbor and Connectivity Test**
   - CDP identifies: `Router, Switch, IGMP` ✅
   - Ping success rate to `192.168.11.1`: ✅ `100%`

4. **Branch1 ➡ LAX Trace**
   - SFO (`192.168.11.24`) and LAX (`172.17.12.97`) listed in traceroute ✅

### 💡 Real-World Use

These Cisco commands are used **every single day** in enterprise networking:
- `show` commands help you audit systems.
- `ping` and `traceroute` prove connectivity and reveal bottlenecks.
- `cdp` is critical when mapping unknown topologies.
