## 5.1.6 â€“ Router Configuration

Routers connect **different networks** or **subnets** and control how traffic flows between them.

### ðŸ§± Basic Placement Rule

- âœ… **Same subnet = no router needed**
- âœ… **Different subnets = must be separated by a router**

Example:
- Hosts on 192.168.1.0/24 donâ€™t need a router to talk.
- Hosts on 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 need a router in between.

### ðŸ›  How Routers Are Accessed & Configured

Most routers are **headless appliances** (no screen or keyboard), configured via:

- **Console cable (local)** â€“ Serial connection to a console port
- **SSH (remote)** â€“ Secure login over the network
- **Loopback interface** â€“ Virtual interface not tied to physical hardware  
  - Great for managing routers when physical ports go down
  - Gets its own IP

### ðŸ§ª Sample CLI: RIP Routing Configuration (VyOS)

```bash
set protocols rip interface eth0
set protocols rip interface eth1
set protocols rip redistribute connected
commit && save && exit
show ip rip
```

### ðŸ§­ Routing Table Output Sample

| Code | Meaning     |
|------|-------------|
| R    | RIP learned |
| C    | Connected   |
| S    | Static      |
| O    | OSPF        |
| B    | BGP         |

**Sub-codes:**
- (n) = normal  
- (i) = interface  
- (r) = redistributed

---

### ðŸ›  Configuration Checklist

- âœ… Apply an IP address to each interface.
- âœ… Configure routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, etc.) or add static routes.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Takeaway

You don't just plug in a routerâ€”it must:
- Know where it is in the network (**interfaces**)
- Know where to send traffic (**routes**)
- Be manageable remotely (**loopback/SSH**)
