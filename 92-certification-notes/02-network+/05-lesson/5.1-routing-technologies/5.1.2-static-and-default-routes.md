## 5.1.2 – Static and Default Routes

Routing table entries fall into **four categories**:

1. **Directly connected** – Router has an active local interface on the subnet.
2. **Remote routes** – Learned via static config or dynamic protocols.
3. **Host routes** – Routes to a specific single IP (`/32` for IPv4, `/128` for IPv6).
4. **Default route** – Used when no specific match exists. The “gateway of last resort.”

### 🔌 Directly Connected Routes

- Automatically added when an interface is configured with an IP and is **up**.
- Appears as `C` in Cisco routing tables.
- Example:  
  `C 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0`

### 🧭 Static Routes

A **static route** is manually added and doesn’t change unless the admin edits it.

#### Why use them?
- Simplicity in small networks
- Control and predictability
- Security (no dynamic learning)

#### Downsides?
- No automatic failover
- High maintenance in large or changing topologies

#### Types:
- **Persistent**: Survive reboots
- **Non-persistent**: Lost after reboot (good for temp/test routes)

💡 If a static route becomes unreachable (next-hop down), the route is disabled.

### 🌍 Default Routes

The **default route** is a **wildcard**:
- IPv4: `0.0.0.0/0`
- IPv6: `::/0`

Used **when no other route matches** a destination.
- Think of it as: _“I don’t know where this is, send it to the default gateway.”_

Most end-user systems use a **default route to their local router** (usually your home gateway).
Enterprise routers often use default routes to reach **ISP routers** or **core edge routers**.

🛠 On Cisco:
```plaintext
S* 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 192.168.0.1
```

- `S` = static
- `*` = candidate default
