# 4.5.8 ‚Äì Common IPv6 Address Prefixes

## üìã Key IPv6 Address Types and Prefixes

| **Type**                 | **Prefix**                    | **Starts With**        | **Purpose**                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Global Unicast           | `2000::/3`                    | `2`, `3`                | Publicly routable, internet-facing           |
| Link-local Unicast       | `fe80::/10`                   | `fe80`                  | Local segment only; required for ND          |
| Multicast                | `ff00::/8`                    | `ff`                    | One-to-many communication                    |
| Multicast (link local)   | `ff02::/16`                   | `ff02::1`, `ff02::2`    | All nodes, all routers, DHCP relay, etc.     |
| Solicited-node multicast | `ff02::1:ff00:0/104`          | `ff02::1:ffXX:XXXX`     | Used for efficient neighbor discovery (ND)   |
| Unspecified              | `::/128`                      | `::`                    | "No address" ‚Äî host hasn‚Äôt configured yet    |
| Loopback                 | `::1/128`                     | `::1`                   | Host sends packet to itself                  |
| Documentation / Example  | `2001:db8::/32`               | `2001:db8`              | Reserved for documentation/testing examples  |

## üß† Special Notes

- **Global unicast = IPv6‚Äôs public IPs.** Often grouped in `/48` blocks (common ISP allocation).
- **Link-local is required** for basic connectivity between nodes on the same subnet. Not routable.
- **Multicast replaces broadcast** in IPv6 ‚Äî everything from router discovery to DHCPv6 uses it.
- **Solicited-node** is auto-generated from your unicast address (last 24 bits). It‚Äôs how ND finds you.
- **Unspecified (::)** means ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who I am yet.‚Äù
- **Loopback (::1)** is your internal test ping.
- **Documentation block** (2001:db8::/32) = safe-to-use fake IPs in lab notes and exam questions.

## üî• Quick Match Guide (Flash-style)

- `ff02::1` = All nodes  
- `ff02::2` = All routers  
- `ff02::1:2` = DHCP agents  
- `::` = Unspecified  
- `::1` = Loopback  
- `fe80::/10` = Link-local  
- `2000::/3` = Global unicast  
- `2001:db8::/32` = Documentation only

## üß™ Real-World Tip

You‚Äôll see link-local and solicited-node addresses constantly in `ip -6 addr` and `ipconfig /all` outputs ‚Äî they‚Äôre how IPv6 stays lean and smart about neighbor detection.
