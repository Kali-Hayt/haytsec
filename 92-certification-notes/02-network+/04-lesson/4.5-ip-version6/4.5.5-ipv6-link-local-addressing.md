## 📘 IPv6 Link-Local Addressing

### 🧱 What Is a Link-Local Address?

- Used for communication **within a single local link** (LAN segment).
- ❌ Not routable — cannot cross routers.
- Required on all IPv6 interfaces — even if the device also has a global address.
- Equivalent to IPv4 **APIPA**: `169.254.0.0/16`

### 🧱 Format Breakdown

| Segment              | Size   | Notes                              |
|----------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Prefix               | 10 bits| Always starts with `1111 1110 10`  |
| Zeros                | 54 bits| All set to `0`                     |
| Interface ID         | 64 bits| Based on MAC or privacy random     |

✅ Address range: `fe80::/10`  
Example: `fe80::1a2b:3c4d:5e6f:7g8h`

### 🔍 Zone ID / Scope Index

- Link-local addresses must be **unique per link**.
- To avoid confusion, a **zone index** is added after the address.
  - Windows: `fe80::1%1`
  - Linux: `fe80::1%eth0`
- This specifies **which interface** to use (loopback, Ethernet, VPN, etc.)

### 💡 Key Use Cases
- Router discovery
- Neighbor discovery protocol (NDP)
- DHCPv6 messages between local devices

### ✅ Summary Table

| Feature               | Value / Note                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Range                 | `fe80::/10`                               |
| Routable?             | ❌ No — local link only                    |
| Required on all hosts | ✅ Yes                                     |
| Uses zone ID?         | ✅ Yes, like `%eth0` or `%1`               |

### 🧠 Analogy
> Link-local is like having a **walkie-talkie** — you can only talk to people in the same room.  
> The zone ID is the **channel** you’re broadcasting on.
