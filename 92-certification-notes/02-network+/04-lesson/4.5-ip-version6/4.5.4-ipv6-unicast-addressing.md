## 📘 IPv6 Unicast Addressing

### 🧱 What is a Unicast Address?
- A **unicast** address identifies a **single interface** on the network.
- IPv6 unicast addresses are **scoped**, meaning they apply to:
  - **Global scope** (routable on the Internet)
  - **Link-local scope** (private/local use only)

---

## 🌐 Global Unicast Address Format

These are like IPv4 **public** addresses — unique and routable.

| Segment                  | Size     | Description                                                       |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Routing Prefix    | 3 bits   | Starts with `001` (e.g., `2xxx` or `3xxx` in hex)                 |
| Network ID               | 45 bits  | Assigned hierarchically to registries, ISPs, and customers       |
| Subnet ID                | 16 bits  | Used internally to segment a site’s network                      |
| Interface ID             | 64 bits  | Identifies a device on the network                                |

Total: **128 bits**

### 🔍 Example Address Breakdown

A global unicast might look like:

2001:0db8:abcd:0012::1234
- `2001:0db8:abcd` → Global + network ID  
- `0012` → Subnet ID  
- `::1234` → Interface ID

## 🧬 Interface ID / EUI-64

The **last 64 bits** of an IPv6 address can be generated using the device’s **MAC address**.

### 🔧 Method 1: EUI-64 (MAC-derived)
- MAC address = 48 bits  
- IPv6 Interface ID = 64 bits  
- Process:
  1. Split MAC in half, insert `FFFE` in the middle
  2. Flip the **7th bit** (U/L bit) of the first byte

#### 🧪 Example
MAC: `00:60:8c:12:3a:bc`  
→ Insert FFFE → `00608cFFFE123abc`  
→ Flip 7th bit of first byte: `02608cFFFE123abc`  
→ Final: `260:8cff:fe12:3abc` (formatted)

✅ This becomes the Interface ID

---

### 🔧 Method 2: Privacy Extensions
- OS generates a **random 64-bit value** instead of using the MAC.
- Helps avoid tracking across networks.
- Often used on **client devices** like laptops and phones.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Type                   | Purpose                        | Auto-Generated?   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Global Unicast         | Public internet routing        | Manual or DHCPv6  |
| Link-Local Unicast     | Local communication only       | Always auto-set   |
| EUI-64 Interface ID    | Device identity (via MAC)      | ✅ Yes (if enabled)|
| Privacy-based ID       | Prevent tracking               | ✅ Yes (often default)|

### 🧠 Analogy
> EUI-64 is like taking your **driver’s license number**, modifying it slightly, and using it as your **network nameplate**.  
> Privacy mode is like using a **random alias** that changes over time.
