## 4.1.6 â€“ Lab: Explore Packets and Frames

### ðŸ§ª Objective

Use **Wireshark** to capture and inspect real network traffic in order to analyze **packet structure**, **encapsulation layers**, and **protocol behavior**.

---

### ðŸ§° Tools Required

- **Wireshark**
- **Active network interface** (in this case: `enp2s0`)

---

### âœ… Lab Steps

1. **Capture Packets**  
   Start a Wireshark capture on the `enp2s0` interface for ~5 seconds.

2. **Apply Filter**  
   Use the following display filter to isolate **HTTP POST** requests:
   ```
   http.request.method == POST
   ```

3. **Select a Packet**  
   Click on one HTTP POST packet in the top pane.

4. **Analyze the Frame**  
   Use the **packet details pane** to inspect:
   - Ethernet (Layer 2 frame)
   - IP header (Layer 3)
   - TCP segment (Layer 4)
   - HTTP content (Layer 7)

5. **Answer Lab Questions**  
   Use the selected packet to respond to **questions 1â€“9** in the lab worksheet.

### ðŸ§  Learning Focus

- Understand **encapsulation**: how data is layered from App â†’ Transport â†’ Network â†’ Link.
- Recognize the structure of a **frame** vs. a **packet**.
- Practice reading raw traffic to identify protocol behavior.

> This lab reinforces OSI layering in real-world traffic and builds packet analysis skills critical for troubleshooting and security work.
