## 4.1.5 – Multicast and Anycast Addressing

While most IPv4 traffic is **unicast** or **broadcast**, two other addressing types exist for **specialized use cases**: **multicast** and **anycast**.

---

### 📡 Multicast Addressing

- **Multicast** allows a host to send data to **multiple recipients** that have **opted in** to receive the traffic.
- Used in scenarios like:
  - Streaming video
  - Online gaming
  - IPTV
  - Financial tickers

#### 🧠 Multicast IP Range (IPv4)

- Reserved IP range:
  ```
  224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
  ```

- These addresses are **not globally routable** like normal unicast IPs. They're used for **group-based delivery**.

#### ⚙️ Group Membership

- Devices **join multicast groups** to receive specific traffic.
- Controlled using the **Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)**.
- A host signals its interest by joining a multicast group via IGMP.

---

### 🧱 Multicast at Layer 2 (Ethernet)

- Uses special **MAC addresses** that start with:
  ```
  01-00-5E
  ```
- The rest of the MAC address is derived from the multicast IP group.
- For multicast to work properly, the switch must support **IGMP snooping**:
  - Without it, the switch floods multicast traffic like a broadcast
  - With it, only ports in the group get the frame

---

### 🌍 Anycast Addressing

- **Anycast** allows multiple hosts to share the **same IP address**
- When a router receives a packet for that IP, it forwards it to the **"closest" or most optimal** host — based on routing metrics

> ✅ Used for:
> - Load balancing
> - Redundancy/failover
> - DNS servers (e.g. multiple root DNS servers share anycast IPs)

### 🧠 Key Concept

> Anycast = **One-to-nearest (based on routing)**  
> Multicast = **One-to-many (based on membership)**

### 📊 Comparison Summary

| Address Type | Purpose                     | Destination Type      | Routing Behavior                |
|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Unicast      | One-to-one communication     | Single IP host        | Routed normally                 |
| Broadcast    | One-to-all on local subnet   | All hosts in subnet   | Stops at router                 |
| **Multicast**| One-to-many (by group)       | Subscribed hosts only | Controlled via IGMP             |
| **Anycast**  | One-to-nearest of many       | Closest host in group | Routing decides best target     |

> 🧠 Multicast saves bandwidth  
> 🧠 Anycast boosts speed, balance, and uptime
