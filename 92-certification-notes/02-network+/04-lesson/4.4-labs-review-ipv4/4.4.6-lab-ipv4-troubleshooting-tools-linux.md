# 🧪 Lab: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools (Linux)

**Tags:** #networking #lab #linux #troubleshooting

## 🛠️ Objective
Use `traceroute` and DNS analysis to determine network paths and troubleshoot slow connectivity to a remote system.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- Ran `traceroute` to the external DNS server: `163.128.80.93`
- Identified the IP address of the external DNS server from the exhibit:
  - ✅ `163.128.78.93` (correct)
- Traced hops from local gateway to external DNS:
  - 192.168.0.5 → 198.28.56.1 → 198.28.56.18 → 198.28.2.254 → 163.128.80.93
- Ran `traceroute` to remote IP `10.10.20.10`
  - Confirmed last router in the path: `73.44.216.7`
  - Total routers (hops) between source and target: `6`

---

## 🔍 Notes
- Internal IPs (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) are not available in public `whois` databases.  
- `traceroute` shows hop-by-hop IPs, not names—need exhibits or `whois` for context.
- ISP gateway `198.28.2.254` connects to external DNS and remote systems.
- The `Support` system uses this route to reach the outside world.

---

## 💡 Learnings
- The first hop in `traceroute` is usually the default gateway (router).
- Private IPs = invisible to internet lookups.
- Use `whois` only for public IPs to find ownership/org info.
- External DNS and remote destinations can be traced to confirm latency or routing problems.
