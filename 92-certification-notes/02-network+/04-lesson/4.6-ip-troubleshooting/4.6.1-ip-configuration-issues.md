# 4.6.1 – IP Configuration Issues

## 🧱 Summary

Troubleshooting IP config problems happens at the **Network layer**. If Physical and Data Link layers check out, then it’s time to verify:

- IP address
- Subnet mask
- Default gateway
- Host’s logical network location

Tools: `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `ip` (Windows/Linux)

---

## ❌ Incorrect IP Address

- Must match the subnet and netmask of its neighbors
- Wrong subnet = isolation from network

**Example:**
- Subnet: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Host A: `192.168.1.10 / 255.255.255.0`
- Host B: `192.168.1.11 / 255.255.255.0`
- Host C: `192.168.0.21 / 255.255.255.0` ← wrong subnet!

🛑 Host C is on `192.168.0.0/24` — **cannot talk** to A/B

---

## ❗ Non-Default Subnets

More complex with non-default masks (e.g. `/28 = 255.255.255.240`)
- You *must* calculate ranges, not just match first 3 octets

**Example:**
- Subnet: `198.51.100.16/28` → Valid host range: `198.51.100.17–30`
- Host A/B in range ✅
- Host C: `198.51.100.21 / 255.255.255.240` → Check binary!

---

## 🚫 Incorrect Subnet Mask

Even if the IP looks fine, a **bad mask** will:
- Cause the host to think other devices are on a different subnet
- Misroute replies
- Route local traffic through the default gateway (bad)

**Example:**
- A/B: `192.168.1.10–11 / 255.255.255.0`
- C: `192.168.1.21 / 255.255.255.240` → C thinks it's on a different subnet

🧨 Extra load on the router  
🧠 May still ARP fine, but ICMP may bounce through gateway

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Subnet boundaries can split within octets — binary calc matters
- Network and broadcast addresses are **not valid host IPs**
- Routers may issue ICMP Redirects in misconfig cases
