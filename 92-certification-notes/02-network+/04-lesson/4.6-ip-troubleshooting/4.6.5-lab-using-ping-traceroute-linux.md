## 💻 Network Setup (From Lab Exhibit)

| Location            | Name                | IP Address       |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Office 1            | Office1             | 192.168.0.30     |
| Office 2            | Office2             | 192.168.0.31     |
| Support Office      | Support             | 199.92.0.32      |
| IT Administration   | IT-Laptop           | 192.168.0.33     |
| Router              | Bldg A Router       | 192.168.0.5      |
| Router              | Bldg B CorpNet Rt.  | 198.28.56.1      |
| ISP                 | External DNS Server | 163.128.78.93 / 163.128.80.93 |

## 🛠️ What You Did (Step-by-Step Breakdown)

### 1. IT-Laptop — Run `ping`
- `ping -c4 192.168.0.30` → ✅ Success: Same subnet as Office1.
- `ping -c4 199.92.0.32` → ❌ Fail: Support is on different network, not reachable.
- `ping -c4 192.168.0.5` → ✅ Success: Same subnet as Bldg A router.
- `ping -c4 163.128.78.93` → ❌ Fail: No default gateway, can’t reach ISP.

### 2. IT-Laptop — Check IP config
`
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
ls
cat ifcfg-enp2s0

- ❌ No `GATEWAY=192.168.0.5` entry.
- This is why external pings (like to the DNS server) failed. The system can’t forward packets off-network.
### 3. Office2 — Use `traceroute`

- `traceroute 198.28.56.1` → Showed only **1 hop** (Bldg A router → CorpNet router).
- `traceroute 163.128.78.93` → Showed **multiple hops**:
    - Bldg A Router
    - CorpNet Router
    - DNS Server

## 🔍 Key Lessons

- 🧱 Devices **must** be in the same subnet to communicate without a router.
- ✅ A **default gateway** is required to send traffic beyond the local network.
- `ping` shows basic connectivity. `traceroute` maps the route and detects hops.
- Linux config files like `ifcfg-enp2s0` must contain a `GATEWAY=` value for proper routing.
