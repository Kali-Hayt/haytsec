# 4.6.3 ‚Äì IP Forwarding Issues

## üß± Description

If the address configuration on the local host seems to be correct, you can complete a series of connectivity tests using `ping` to determine the likely location and scope of a fault.

### üîÅ General Ping Sequence:
1. **Ping loopback** (`127.0.0.1`)  
   - Verifies that TCP/IP is installed and loaded correctly.  
   - If it fails, reinstall the network protocol stack.

2. **Ping host (local IP)**  
   - Confirms the adapter is functioning.  
   - Failure indicates a config error or a faulty adapter/driver.

3. **Ping gateway** (default router IP)  
   - Tests if the router is reachable and local LAN is working.

4. **Ping remote host** (known good IP beyond router)  
   - Confirms routing is operational and default gateway is set properly.

5. **Ping host name** (e.g., `google.com`)  
   - Verifies DNS resolution and outbound Internet access.

## üîç Notes
- If ping to **loopback** fails ‚Üí TCP/IP stack is broken.
- If ping to **local IP** fails ‚Üí config or NIC issue.
- If ping to **gateway** fails ‚Üí routing or switch config problem.
- If ping to **remote IP** fails ‚Üí possible gateway config issue.
- If ping to **hostname** fails but IP works ‚Üí DNS issue.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas
- ICMP might be blocked by firewall or security software.
- Start with remote ping in real-world use, then backtrack.
- Great method when diagnosing **new setups** or weird issues.
