# QUESTION 1  
Why might pinging remote hosts fail even if the network configuration is correct?

❌ The default gateway is down.  
❌ The local host's IP address is incorrectly configured.  
❌ The loopback address is not responding.  
✅ ICMP is blocked by a firewall or other security software.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Default gateway**: If it were down, you wouldn’t reach outside networks at all—but that’s a routing issue, not an ICMP-specific block.  
- ❌ **Local IP misconfigured**: That would prevent any connectivity, but the question states the configuration is correct.  
- ❌ **Loopback not responding**: That’s a local hardware/software issue, not relevant to remote host pings.

# QUESTION 2  
What is the first step in troubleshooting IP configuration issues if you have ruled out problems at the Physical and Data Link layers?

❌ Check the subnet mask of the host.  
❌ Restart the router.  
❌ Replace network cables.  
✅ Use ipconfig or ifconfig to verify the host configuration.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Check subnet mask**: You're jumping ahead. You need to *see the full config* first.  
- ❌ **Restart the router**: Premature and unrelated to host-side IP checks.  
- ❌ **Replace network cables**: Physical layer issue—which the question says is already ruled out.

# QUESTION 3  
What does successfully pinging the IP address of the default gateway verify?

❌ That TCP/IP is installed and loaded correctly  
❌ That the network adapter is functioning properly  
✅ That you can communicate with another host on the local network  
❌ That the routing infrastructure is correctly configured

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **TCP/IP loaded**: That’s verified by pinging *127.0.0.1* (loopback), not the gateway.  
- ❌ **Adapter functioning**: Same — loopback or self-ping would verify this first.  
- ❌ **Routing infrastructure**: Default gateway is a local device. Routing infrastructure refers to *external* routing beyond that.

# QUESTION 4  
What should you suspect if you cannot ping a local host and the error is "destination unreachable"?

✅ Incorrect IP address or netmask in the IP configuration  
❌ ICMP is blocked by a firewall or other security software  
❌ The default gateway parameter on the local host is incorrect  
❌ The network protocol stack needs to be reinstalled

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **ICMP blocked**: If ICMP is blocked, you’d see “Request timed out” or no response—not “destination unreachable.”  
- ❌ **Default gateway**: Not relevant for *local* host communication—it’s only used when routing off-subnet.  
- ❌ **Reinstall stack**: That’s a nuclear option and wouldn’t be the *first* assumption for this specific error.  

🧠 “Destination unreachable” usually points to bad addressing—you're aiming, but there's no target in the subnet.

# QUESTION 5  
How can you identify machines with duplicate IP addresses?

✅ Using `ping` and then `arp -a` to examine the ARP cache table  
❌ By restarting the router  
❌ Checking the physical connections of all network devices  
❌ Assigning new IP addresses to all devices on the network

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Restarting the router**: That’s not going to detect anything—it just reboots the device.  
- ❌ **Physical connections**: IP conflicts are logical issues, not cable-related.  
- ❌ **Assigning new IPs**: That’s a brute-force fix, not a *diagnostic* method. You want to **detect** first, not carpet-bomb your network config.

🧠 `arp -a` lets you inspect which MACs are mapped to which IPs. If multiple IPs show the same MAC, or a single IP resolves to *different* MACs across devices—boom, you’ve got a conflict.

# QUESTION 6  
What is a likely cause of duplicate MAC addresses on a network?

✅ Use of locally administered addressing  
❌ Incorrect subnet mask configuration  
❌ A malfunctioning DHCP server  
❌ A faulty network cable

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Subnet mask**: That affects IP routing, not hardware addresses.  
- ❌ **DHCP server**: It hands out IP addresses, not MACs.  
- ❌ **Faulty cable**: That causes physical disconnections, not logical address duplication.

🧱 **Locally administered MACs** override the burned-in address. If two admins (or bad scripts) assign the same MAC manually, bam—network chaos.

# QUESTION 7  
What is the first step in the general ping sequence for identifying connectivity issues?

✅ Ping the loopback address.  
❌ Ping the IP address of the default gateway.  
❌ Ping the IP address of a remote host.  
❌ Ping the IP address of the local host.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Default gateway**: That’s step 3 or 4. First, you verify local TCP/IP stack.  
- ❌ **Remote host**: That’s a later stage—after you confirm local and LAN.  
- ❌ **Local host IP**: Useful, but not as fundamental as loopback.

🧱 Loopback (127.0.0.1) tests whether the TCP/IP stack is working on the device itself—**no NIC or cable needed**. Always start local, then branch out.

# QUESTION 8  
You are monitoring network traffic and notice that ARP requests for a specific IP address are receiving responses from two different MAC addresses.  
What is the **MOST likely** cause, and how should you proceed?

✅ The IP address is configured on a virtual machine *and* its host; reassign the IP address to only one device.  
❌ There may be a duplicate MAC address issue; use a protocol analyzer to examine ARP traffic more closely.  
❌ This is a normal occurrence in networks with multiple access points; no action is needed.  
❌ The network switch is malfunctioning; replace the switch immediately.

**Why the correct answer:**  
If *two devices share the same IP* (classic when a VM is cloned or bridged and not readdressed), *both* reply to ARP queries for that IP. Your ARP cache will flip-flop between two different MAC entries for the same IP — exactly what you observed.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **Duplicate MAC issue**: Would manifest differently (MAC collision at Layer 2), not as *two MACs responding to one IP*. The symptom you saw is “duplicate IP,” not “duplicate MAC.”  
- ❌ **Normal in multi-AP networks**: Multiple APs don’t make two different hosts claim the same IP. This is *not* expected behavior.  
- ❌ **Bad switch**: A failing switch can cause drops or flapping links, but it doesn’t create two legitimate ARP replies for a single IP.

🛠 **Fix:** Track down both devices (likely the VM guest and its host NIC or another statically configured device), reassign unique IP addresses, and clear ARP caches.

💡 **Memory hook:** *Two MACs, one IP = duplicate IP (VM clone!)*

# QUESTION 9  
In a subnet with a /28 mask, why can't you rely solely on the first three octets to determine if an IP address is within the same subnet?

✅ Because the network prefix boundary lies within the last octet  
❌ Because the /28 mask only applies to the last octet  
❌ Because the first three octets are always the same in any subnet  
❌ Because the subnet mask does not affect the first three octets

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Only applies to last octet**: The /28 mask spans the whole address—it doesn’t **only** apply to the last octet, it includes part of it (specifically, the first 4 bits of the last octet).  
- ❌ **First three octets are always the same**: That’s false—especially in VLSM and CIDR scenarios, subnetting happens within any octet.  
- ❌ **Mask doesn’t affect first three**: Incorrect. The mask **can** affect any part of the IP, depending on its length. /28 just happens to split in the fourth octet.

🧱 Remember:  
- /28 = 255.255.255.240 → that's 28 bits → full first three octets + 4 bits of the last  
- You need to compare **all 4 octets**, especially the final one, because that’s where the subnet division occurs.

# QUESTION 10  
What issue arises when a host has an incorrect subnet mask that is longer than it should be?

✅ The host misroutes its replies, thinking communicating hosts are on a different subnet.  
❌ The host cannot receive any communications.  
❌ The host's IP address is automatically changed.  
❌ The host correctly routes its replies without any issues.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Cannot receive any communications**: Not always true. The host can still send and receive data within what it thinks is its subnet—but it won’t talk to devices it incorrectly sees as "outside."  
- ❌ **IP address is changed**: The IP stays the same unless manually changed or updated by DHCP—not affected by subnet mask errors.  
- ❌ **Correctly routes its replies**: That's the opposite of the actual problem. With a longer mask, it *thinks* more addresses are on a different network, so it sends traffic unnecessarily to the default gateway.

🔍 Example:  
- Real subnet: 255.255.255.0  
- Mistake: 255.255.255.240 (/28)  
- Result: Host thinks `192.168.1.20` is *outside* its subnet → sends to gateway instead of directly.
