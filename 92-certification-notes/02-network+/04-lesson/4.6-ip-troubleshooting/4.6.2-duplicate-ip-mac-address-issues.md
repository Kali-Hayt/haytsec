# 4.6.2 – Duplicate IP and MAC Address Issues

## 🧱 Summary

Duplicate addressing issues create chaos at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 2 (MAC).

- Two devices with the **same IP** or **same MAC** will confuse the network.
- Symptoms include lost packets, random delivery, or broken connections.
- Can happen due to static configs, bad DHCP scopes, or cloning.

---

## ⚠️ Duplicate IP Address

- Happens when:
  - Two devices are assigned the same static IP
  - A static IP collides with a DHCP-assigned IP

- **Windows** will disable the interface and show a warning  
- **Linux** may allow traffic but log warnings — results in race conditions

### 🔧 Tools:
- `ping`, `arp -a` (to view ARP table)
- `arping -D` (Linux: detect duplicate replies)

📌 Fix by assigning unique IPs manually or reconfiguring DHCP reservations.

## ⚠️ Duplicate MAC Address

- Less common, but **serious** if it occurs
- Causes ARP confusion:
  - Devices can't tell who’s who
  - Replies may go to the wrong host or be dropped

### 🔧 Tools:
- `arp` utility (view MAC-to-IP mappings)
- `ipconfig /all` or `ip neigh` (verify MAC)
- Switch/router ARP tables
- Protocol analyzer (e.g., Wireshark)

🛑 Duplicate MACs might indicate **spoofing** or **security attacks**.

## 🛡️ Security Note

MAC conflicts **may signal spoofing**  
– A malicious actor could impersonate a trusted host  
– Keep this in mind when diagnosing unexplained MAC issues
