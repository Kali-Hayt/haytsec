## 4.3.4 IPv4 Address Scheme Design

### 🧱 Key Design Factors

When planning an IPv4 network addressing scheme, consider the following:

- The number of IP networks and subnetworks required.
- The number of hosts per subnet that must be supported.
- The network ID must come from a valid **public or private** range — not from:
  - Loopback
  - Link-local
  - Reserved
  - Multicast
  - Experimental/test ranges
- The network and/or host IDs **cannot be all 1s in binary** — that's the broadcast address.
- The network and/or host ID **cannot be all 0s in binary** — that represents "this network."
- Each host ID must be **unique** within the subnet.
- The network ID must be **unique** on the Internet (for public IPs) or within internal networks (for private IPs).

### 🧮 Subnet Math Quick Reference

When subnetting, think in **mask bits**. Each power of 2 doubles the previous:

| Power | Value |
|-------|-------|
| 2²    | 4     |
| 2³    | 8     |
| 2⁴    | 16    |
| 2⁵    | 32    |
| 2⁶    | 64    |
| 2⁷    | 128   |
| 2⁸    | 256   |

Also memorize how many bits turned "on" in a mask (left-to-right) produce which decimal values:

| Bits On | Decimal |
|---------|---------|
| 1       | 128     |
| 2       | 192     |
| 3       | 224     |
| 4       | 240     |
| 5       | 248     |
| 6       | 252     |
| 7       | 254     |
| 8       | 255     |

### 🧠 Subnetting Design Process

Example: Subnetting `172.30.0.0/16`

#### Step 1: Determine Number of Subnets Needed
- Say you need 12 subnets.
- Round up to nearest power of 2 → 16 = 2⁴
- So: Add **4 subnet bits** to the /16
- New mask: `/20` or `255.255.240.0`

#### Step 2: Determine Hosts per Subnet
- Original = /16 → 32 – 16 = 16 bits for hosts
- New = /20 → 32 – 20 = 12 bits for hosts
- Hosts/subnet = `2^12 – 2 = 4094`

> ℹ️ Subtract 2 for the **network address** and the **broadcast address**.

> 💡 **Masking Rule Reminder**:  
> A binary `1` in the mask means "this part is network/subnet".  
> A binary `0` means "this part is host".  
> Want more subnets? → Add more 1s.  
> Want more hosts per subnet? → Keep more 0s.

---

#### Step 3: Determine Subnet IDs
- To find the next subnet ID:
  - Subtract subnet mask octet from 256
  - 256 – 240 = 16 → increment by 16
- Subnets: `172.30.0.0/20`, `172.30.16.0/20`, `172.30.32.0/20`, `...`

#### Step 4: List Subnet Ranges
- For `172.30.16.0/20`:
  - First Host: `172.30.16.1`
  - Last Host: `172.30.31.254`
  - Broadcast: `172.30.31.255`

Repeat for each subnet.

### 🧠 Compare to /24 Example
- /24 = 256 IPs → 8 bits for host
- Want 16 subnets? Need 4 bits for subnet
- Leaves 4 bits for hosts: `2⁴ – 2 = 14 hosts/subnet`

🔍 Careful! Less space for hosts when you carve out more subnets.
