## 4.3.5 ‚Äì Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

Classless addressing was introduced in the 1990s to solve two major issues:
- Scarcity of Class B addresses.
- Exponential growth in routing table entries on the Internet.

CIDR allows for:
- Efficient allocation of IP addresses.
- Reduction of routing table size by summarizing multiple networks into one.

### üß± CIDR Basics
- CIDR uses bits *normally* reserved for the host portion to extend the **network prefix**.
- This results in a more flexible subnetting scheme called **"supernetting"**.
- CIDR does **not** rely on traditional class boundaries (like Class A/B/C).
- CIDR uses **slash notation** (e.g., `/22`) to indicate the number of network bits.

### üß± Supernetting Example

Suppose a company is assigned these 4 Class C networks:
- 198.51.100.0/24
- 198.51.101.0/24
- 198.51.102.0/24
- 198.51.103.0/24

Instead of routing each individually, CIDR allows them to be grouped:
- CIDR aggregate: **198.51.100.0/22**
- Subnet mask: **255.255.252.0**

This collapses 4 routes into **one**, reducing routing table complexity.

### üß± CIDR ANDing Operation

CIDR still uses the classic ANDing operation to determine routing:


If the result matches the route‚Äôs network address, forward the packet.

Example (in binary & decimal):
- 198.51.100.1 AND 255.255.252.0 ‚Üí 198.51.100.0 ‚úÖ (same network)
- 198.51.104.1 AND 255.255.252.0 ‚Üí 198.51.104.0 ‚ùå (different network)

---

### üß± Exterior vs. Interior Routing
- **Exterior Routers** see only the /22 prefix. The complexity of subnetting is hidden.
- **Interior Routers** inside the LAN use finer subnet masks (/24, /25, etc.) to manage smaller subnets.

---

### Summary
- ‚úÖ CIDR supports subnetting and supernetting.
- ‚úÖ Enables more efficient use of IPv4 space.
- ‚úÖ Reduces routing table size by aggregating networks.
- ‚úÖ Supports flexible subnet mask lengths (no class dependency).
