## 4.2.3 – Subnet Masks

The subnet mask determines how many bits of an IPv4 address are used for the **network**, **subnet**, and **host** portions. This affects how many networks and hosts a scheme can support.

### 🧱 Traditional IPv4 Addressing

- Two levels: **Network ID** and **Host ID**
- Used **classful addressing**, based on full octet boundaries
- Inflexible and wasteful for many real-world use cases

## Subnet Addressing

### 🧱 Three-Level Hierarchy
- **Network ID**
- **Subnet ID**
- **Host ID**

To create subnets, bits are borrowed from the host portion and used as **subnet bits**.

🔍 This adds a **middle layer** to improve flexibility in addressing.

## Example: /28 Subnet

- A **/28** subnet mask uses the first **28 bits** for network + subnet.
- Leaves **4 bits** for host ID → `2^4 - 2 = 14 usable hosts`
- Subnetting breaks within the 4th octet (last 8 bits of the IP)

### Breakdown (from diagram):
- Network ID: `198.51.100` → 24 bits
- Subnet ID: 4 bits → `0000` to `1111` (16 total subnets)
- Host ID: 4 bits → `0000` to `1111` (16 total addresses per subnet)

**Subnet Example Addresses:**
- `198.51.100.0/28`
- `198.51.100.16/28`
- `198.51.100.32/28`
- ...
- `198.51.100.240/28`

**Subnet mask (binary)**: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000`  
**Decimal**: `255.255.255.240`

## Internal vs External Use

- **Externally**: Use full network ID + standard mask, e.g. `198.51.100.0/24`
- **Internally**: Hosts apply the more specific subnet mask, e.g. `/28`  
  This allows routing within the organization to function properly.

## Subnet Mask Reference Table

| Bits | Binary        | Decimal |
|------|---------------|---------|
| 1    | 10000000      | 128     |
| 2    | 11000000      | 192     |
| 3    | 11100000      | 224     |
| 4    | 11110000      | 240     |
| 5    | 11111000      | 248     |
| 6    | 11111100      | 252     |
| 7    | 11111110      | 254     |
| 8    | 11111111      | 255     |

🧠 **TIP**: Memorize these decimal values to speed up subnet conversions.

## 🧠 Example Conversion

For a `/14` mask:
- 14 bits = 8 (first octet) + 6 (second octet)
- Binary: `11111111.11111100.00000000.00000000`
- Decimal: `255.252.0.0`

---

## Summary

- Subnetting splits a network into smaller logical segments
- Subnet mask tells devices which part of an IP address is **network**, **subnet**, and **host**
- Subnetting boosts efficiency and control inside networks without affecting outside routing
- Knowing binary and decimal values for subnet masks is essential

✅ **/28 = 255.255.255.240** → 16 IPs per subnet, 14 usable hosts
