## 4.2.6 – Broadcast Addresses

A **broadcast address** is used to send a packet to **all hosts** on a network or subnet.

### 🧱 Definition
The **broadcast address** is the **last address** in any IP subnet:
- All host bits are set to `1`
- Example: For a `/28` subnet mask (`255.255.255.240`), the last 4 bits of the last octet are the **host portion**

---

## 🧮 Example: Broadcast in a /28 Subnet

### Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.240`  
- Host bits: 4 bits  
- `2^4 = 16` addresses total  
- Last address = **broadcast**

### Breakdown for `198.51.100.16/28`:
- Network address: `198.51.100.16`
- Usable host range: `198.51.100.17` – `198.51.100.30`
- **Broadcast address**: `198.51.100.31` ✅

Other subnets from diagram:
| Subnet           | Broadcast Address     |
|------------------|------------------------|
| `198.51.100.16/28` | `198.51.100.31` |
| `198.51.100.32/28` | `198.51.100.47` |
| `198.51.100.48/28` | `198.51.100.63` |

## 🔍 Why It Matters

Broadcasts are used for:
- **ARP requests**
- **DHCP discovery**
- Messages meant for **all devices** on the subnet

🔒 Layer 3 devices (routers) **do not forward broadcasts**.  
They **contain** them within the subnet to avoid flooding the wider network.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Broadcast = all host bits set to `1`
- Occurs at the **last address** of the subnet
- Routers stop broadcasts at subnet boundaries
- Example:  
  - `/28` → 16 addresses → broadcast = `.15` from subnet start

✅ **Formula**:  
**Broadcast = First Address of Subnet + (2^HostBits - 1)**
