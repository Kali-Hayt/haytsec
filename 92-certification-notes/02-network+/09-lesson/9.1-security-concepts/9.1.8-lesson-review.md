# QUESTION 1

**What is the role of encryption in an access control solution?**

- ✅ To convert plaintext into ciphertext  
- ❌ To give readable access to data  
- ❌ To physically secure devices and resources  
- ❌ To serve as the only method of access control  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *To give readable access to data* – This is the opposite of encryption; encryption **restricts** readable access.
- ❌ *To physically secure devices and resources* – That’s a **physical security** measure, not encryption.
- ❌ *To serve as the only method of access control* – Encryption is just **one part** of a broader access control strategy.

# QUESTION 2

**What does "availability" in the CIA Triad refer to?**

- ✅ Information and resources are accessible to those authorized when needed  
- ❌ The system is protected against unauthorized access and attacks and disclosure  
- ❌ Information is protected from unauthorized access except to those with the proper permissions  
- ❌ The data is stored and transferred as intended and that any modification is authorized  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *The system is protected against unauthorized access and attacks and disclosure* – That describes **confidentiality** and **security** in general.
- ❌ *Information is protected from unauthorized access* – That’s **confidentiality**, not availability.
- ❌ *The data is stored and transferred as intended...* – That’s the definition of **integrity**, not availability.

---
# QUESTION 3

**What does "integrity" in the context of the CIA Triad mean?**

- ✅ The data is stored and transferred as intended and that any modification is authorized  
- ❌ The system is protected against unauthorized access and attacks  
- ❌ Information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it  
- ❌ Certain information should only be known to certain people  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Protected against unauthorized access and attacks* – That’s about **confidentiality**, not integrity.
- ❌ *Accessible to those authorized to view or modify* – That’s describing **availability** or access control.
- ❌ *Only known to certain people* – That’s strictly **confidentiality**.

---
# QUESTION 4

**What does a ciphertext represent in the context of encryption?**

- ❌ The key used to encrypt the plaintext  
- ❌ The conversion of plaintext into a hash  
- ❌ The original human-readable information  
- ✅ The encrypted version of plaintext  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Key used to encrypt* – That’s just the **input** to the encryption process, not the result (ciphertext).
- ❌ *Conversion into a hash* – Hashing is **not encryption**. It’s one-way and doesn’t produce ciphertext.
- ❌ *Original human-readable information* – That’s **plaintext**, not ciphertext.

---
# QUESTION 5

**What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?**

- ✅ Data that can identify, contact, or locate an individual  
- ❌ Data that is encrypted and stored securely  
- ❌ Information related to a company's financial status  
- ❌ Any data that can be publicly accessed  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Encrypted and stored securely* – That’s a security **practice**, not a definition of PII.
- ❌ *Company's financial status* – That’s **business data**, not personal data about individuals.
- ❌ *Publicly accessed data* – PII is **private by nature**; if it’s public, it’s no longer protected as PII.

# QUESTION 6

**What does a risk assessment involve?**

- ❌ Reviewing employee performance and productivity  
- ❌ Conducting physical security checks on company premises  
- ✅ Auditing the company's systems for risk factors  
- ❌ Auditing the company's financial statements for fraud  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Employee performance* – That’s **HR**, not cybersecurity or risk management.
- ❌ *Physical security checks* – That’s a **subset of security**, but not the full scope of a risk assessment.
- ❌ *Financial fraud audit* – That’s the job of **financial auditors**, not risk analysts.

🧱 A proper risk assessment identifies vulnerabilities, threats, and the potential impact—so you can prioritize and mitigate risk effectively.

---
# QUESTION 7

**What poses a greater threat than zero-day vulnerabilities?**

✅ Unpatched or legacy systems  
❌ Newly released software  
❌ Strong password policies  
❌ Encrypted data storage  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Newly released software* – These may contain unknown bugs, but they’re not inherently more dangerous than known, unpatched flaws.
- ❌ *Strong password policies* – These **reduce** risk, not increase it. They're part of best practices.
- ❌ *Encrypted data storage* – This helps secure data, not expose it. It’s a **defensive control**, not a threat.

🔍 **Zero-day vulnerabilities** are dangerous, but *unpatched legacy systems* are sitting ducks—attackers already know how to exploit them. They're low-hanging fruit and often go unmonitored, making them *even more dangerous* in practice.

# QUESTION 8

**What is a honeypot in the context of cybersecurity?**

✅ A computer system set up to attract attackers  
❌ A software tool used for encrypting data  
❌ A type of malware designed to steal data  
❌ A firewall configuration technique  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *A software tool used for encrypting data* – That’s encryption software, not deception tech.
- ❌ *A type of malware designed to steal data* – That’s spyware or infostealers, not honeypots.
- ❌ *A firewall configuration technique* – Firewalls filter traffic; honeypots lure it in.

🧱 A **honeypot** is a decoy system meant to look vulnerable or enticing, set up on purpose to **observe attackers**, distract them, and learn from their methods without risking real assets.

---
# QUESTION 9

**Under what condition can an organization process credit card transactions directly?**

✅ If they adopt the PCI DSS standard  
❌ If they encrypt all their emails  
❌ If they have an internet presence  
❌ If they use cloud storage  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Encrypt all their emails* – Good practice, but irrelevant to **credit card processing compliance**.
- ❌ *Have an internet presence* – Literally anyone can have that. Doesn’t imply secure handling of payment data.
- ❌ *Use cloud storage* – Again, doesn’t address **how** card data is handled or protected.

🧱 PCI DSS (**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard**) is a mandatory framework if you want to handle, transmit, or store **cardholder data** yourself. No PCI DSS? You better use a third-party processor.

# QUESTION 10

**What is the difficulty in implementing security controls?**

✅ They can be expensive.  
❌ They are not supported by IT service frameworks.  
❌ They are always too complex to implement.  
❌ They only address low-level risks.

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Not supported by IT service frameworks* – False. Most modern frameworks (like ITIL, NIST CSF, COBIT) **include security controls**.
- ❌ *Too complex to implement* – Not always. Many controls are **straightforward**, like enforcing MFA or patching.
- ❌ *Only address low-level risks* – Many controls target **critical systems** and **high-impact threats**.

🧱 The real barrier? 💸 Cost. Especially for smaller orgs, implementing robust controls like SIEM, IDS, endpoint protection, or continuous monitoring can strain budgets.

---
# QUESTION 11

**What is the purpose of a cybersecurity audit?**

✅ To ensure a security posture aligns with established standards  
❌ To install security software on all company devices  
❌ To assess the organization's IT budget  
❌ To train employees on cybersecurity best practices

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Install security software* – That’s part of **implementation**, not an audit.
- ❌ *Assess IT budget* – That’s **financial or operational auditing**, not cybersecurity-specific.
- ❌ *Train employees* – That’s **security awareness training**, not an audit function.

🧱 A cybersecurity audit is like a **report card**: it evaluates if current security controls match frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or PCI DSS. 🔍 It finds gaps so organizations can close them before attackers exploit them.

# QUESTION 12

**What can the most serious vulnerabilities allow an attacker to do?**

✅ Execute arbitrary code on the system  
❌ Improve application security  
❌ Increase system performance  
❌ Encrypt system files for data protection

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Improve application security* – That’s the job of defenders, not attackers exploiting vulnerabilities.
- ❌ *Increase system performance* – Exploits **degrade** performance or crash systems; they don’t optimize them.
- ❌ *Encrypt system files for data protection* – Attackers might encrypt files, but it’s for **ransom**, not protection. It’s malicious, not secure.

🧱 *Arbitrary code execution (ACE)* is the holy grail for attackers. It means they can **run anything they want**, often as root or SYSTEM – malware, reverse shells, crypto miners, you name it. This is why RCE (remote code execution) vulnerabilities are critical priority in patching cycles.

---
# QUESTION 13

**What is one of the key benefits of using a honeypot or honeynet in cybersecurity?**

✅ Providing an early warning of attacks  
❌ Reducing the need for other security measures  
❌ Increasing the encryption strength  
❌ Completely eliminating cyber threats

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Reducing the need for other security measures* – Honeypots are **supplemental**, not replacements. You still need firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection, etc.
- ❌ *Increasing the encryption strength* – They have nothing to do with cryptographic algorithms or key management.
- ❌ *Completely eliminating cyber threats* – That’s a pipe dream. Honeypots can **detect**, **delay**, and **study** threats, but not eliminate them.

🧱 Honeypots act like digital “bait” to lure in attackers. If someone interacts with them, it's a huge red flag—they're probably up to no good. That **early signal** gives defenders time to respond before damage is done.

# QUESTION 14

**What is meant by "data at rest"?**

✅ Data stored on a persistent storage media  
❌ Data being transmitted over a network  
❌ Data being actively processed by a computer  
❌ Data present in volatile memory

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Data being transmitted over a network* – That’s **data in transit**, not at rest. It's vulnerable while moving.
- ❌ *Data being actively processed by a computer* – That’s **data in use**, like what’s in CPU registers or RAM during runtime.
- ❌ *Data present in volatile memory* – That’s also **data in use**, specifically in RAM, not “at rest.”

🧱 Think of "data at rest" like a file saved and sitting quietly on your SSD or external drive — not moving, not being worked on, just **stored**. That's when you encrypt it to keep it safe while it’s sitting still.

---
# QUESTION 15

**What does data locality require?**

✅ Data storage within certain geographical boundaries  
❌ Unlimited data transfer between countries  
❌ Data to be stored in the cloud  
❌ Data to be encrypted at all times

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Unlimited data transfer between countries* – That’s actually the opposite of what data locality restricts. Many laws **limit** cross-border transfers.
- ❌ *Data to be stored in the cloud* – Cloud storage **can** comply with data locality, but it's not required by the concept itself.
- ❌ *Data to be encrypted at all times* – That's a **security best practice**, not a requirement of locality. Locality is about **location**, not encryption.

🧱 Data locality means the data must stay **within a certain region** (e.g., EU, US) — often for **compliance** with laws like GDPR. Think of it like your data being on “house arrest” inside its own country.
