## 🔍 Security Audits and Assessments

To support CIA triad objectives, organizations rely on **tools, policies, and assessments** to identify and mitigate risks. This includes hardening systems, defining acceptable use, and continuously evaluating controls.

### 🛡️ Risk Management

**Risk management** is the ongoing process of:

- Identifying
- Assessing
- Mitigating vulnerabilities and threats  
...that could disrupt **critical business functions**.

Most organizations follow **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)** frameworks, tailoring controls to their size, sector, and compliance needs.

#### 🔍 Risk Assessment
A **subset of risk management**, focusing on evaluating:
- Threats
- Vulnerabilities
- Security posture

Often part of audits or continuous monitoring.

### 🧱 Posture Assessment

**Security posture** = an organization’s current state of risk exposure + controls in place.

- Built on **security frameworks** (e.g., NIST, ISO)
- Assesses maturity level of policies, procedures, and technologies
- Includes **security controls** for:
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Availability
  - Non-repudiation

🧠 *Reality check:* You can’t eliminate all risks.  
The goal is to **reduce risk to a level the org can afford**.

🧮 **Risk posture** reflects:
- Which risks are known
- What response options are available
- How they're prioritized

📐 **Posture assessments** are often done using formal frameworks.

### ✅ Cybersecurity Audits

Structured reviews to validate whether an organization’s **security posture aligns with standards and best practices**.

**Types of audits:**
- 🧾 **Compliance audit** – Are we following legal/regulatory requirements?
- 📊 **Risk-based audit** – Where are our biggest threats and vulnerabilities?
- 🛠️ **Technical audit** – Are our systems configured securely?

Common focus areas:
- Network security
- Access controls
- Data protection

---

### 🔄 Process Assessment

Effective mitigation must prioritize **mission-essential functions (MEFs)**—business processes that **cannot be delayed** without serious impact.

💡 *If MEFs stop, the business stops.*

#### 🧠 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
Analyzes:
- What might be lost during a threat scenario
- How long operations can be down before it becomes critical
- What controls are worth the investment (e.g., DoS mitigation, load balancing)

🛠️ Helps quantify:
- Cost of downtime
- Value of security investments
- Strategic priorities in incident response planning

---

## ✅ Summary

- **ERM** = high-level risk strategy
- **Risk Assessment** = deep-dive into threats/vulnerabilities
- **Posture Assessment** = how ready/resilient your org really is
- **Audits** = verify you walk the walk
- **BIA** = estimate real-world consequences of downtime
