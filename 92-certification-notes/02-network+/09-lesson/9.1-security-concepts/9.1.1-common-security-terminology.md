## 🧱 Common Security Terminology

### 🛡️ CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

One of the core models in cybersecurity—**CIA Triad**—defines how data should be protected in any system.

- **Confidentiality** – Only authorized individuals should access the data.  
  _Think: personal medical records or encryption keys._

- **Integrity** – The data must be trustworthy and unaltered unless authorized.  
  _Think: checksum on files or digital signatures._

- **Availability** – The data must be accessible to those who are authorized to use it.  
  _Think: 24/7 access to online banking or cloud backups._

📦 *Envelope-in-a-box analogy:*  
The envelope (Confidentiality) keeps contents private, the contents (Integrity) must remain unchanged, and the box (Availability) ensures delivery to the right place at the right time.

### ⚠️ Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk

Security teams use these three concepts to assess potential weaknesses in a system:

- **Vulnerability** – A flaw or weakness that could be exploited, intentionally or accidentally.  
  _e.g., outdated software, weak passwords_

- **Threat** – Anything (person, system, or situation) that could exploit a vulnerability.  
  _Includes: hackers, malware, insider threats, or natural disasters_  
  - 🔍 The one responsible is the **threat actor/agent**.  
  - 🛠️ The method used is the **attack vector**.

- **Risk** – The likelihood *and* potential impact if a vulnerability is exploited.  
  _Used to guide decisions about mitigation and controls._  
  _e.g., High-risk = unpatched VPN exposed to internet._

🧠 *Mnemonic:*  
**"VTR" = What’s Broken (V), Who Might Break It (T), and How Bad It’ll Be (R).**

## ✅ Summary

- CIA = the holy trinity of securing data
- Vulnerabilities = the “holes”
- Threats = the attackers or events
- Risk = the combo of chance + damage
