## ⚠️ Vulnerability and Exploit Types

### 🛠️ Vulnerabilities

A **vulnerability** is a flaw, weakness, or misconfiguration in software or a system that can be exploited to:
- Circumvent security
- Crash or destabilize the application
- Execute arbitrary code or malware
- Weaken secure configurations

📌 Common targets:
- Web servers
- Email clients
- Web browsers and plugins
- Databases

---

### 💣 Exploits

An **exploit** is the specific **method or code** used to take advantage of a vulnerability.  
It allows an attacker to:
- Gain control
- Execute code
- Damage or disrupt a system

⚠️ Exploits usually rely on **specific conditions** and **software versions**, making patching and version control essential.

---

### ⏱️ Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

A **zero-day** is a vulnerability that is:
- Unknown to the vendor
- Actively exploited **before** a patch is available

🧨 Highly dangerous — attackers can operate for days, weeks, or longer before detection.

💬 _“Zero-day” can refer to both the vulnerability and the malware that exploits it._

---

### 🧟‍♂️ Unpatched and Legacy Systems

While zero-days get headlines, the real threat lies in:
- **Unpatched systems**: not updated with current OS/app patches
- **Legacy systems**: no longer supported by vendors

🧨 These systems often remain vulnerable **indefinitely** and are easy targets.

---

### 🧪 Vulnerability Assessment

A **vulnerability assessment** is the process of:
- Evaluating a system’s security
- Measuring it against **baseline configurations**
- Determining compliance with policy and regulatory standards

🔍 Can be done via:
- Manual inspections
- **Automated vulnerability scanners**

🧠 Goal: Identify weaknesses **before** they are exploited.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Vulnerability** = the weakness  
- **Exploit** = the weapon/tool that takes advantage of it  
- **Zero-day** = exploited before a patch exists  
- **Legacy/unpatched systems** = persistent and dangerous risk  
- **Assessment** = your preemptive strike against all of the above
