## 9.2.4 ‚Äì Malware Attacks

Malware = software that does something **bad** from the **owner‚Äôs perspective**.

üß± **Malware Classification Approaches:**
- **By Vector**: How it gets in and spreads.
- **By Payload**: What it does once inside.
- **By Consent Level**: Whether users allow it in (knowingly or not).

---

### üß± Malware Types by Vector

- **Viruses and Worms**
  - Infect without user authorization.
  - **Viruses**: Attach to files; spread when infected files are run.
  - **Worms**: Live in memory; spread via network without needing to attach to files.

- **Trojan**
  - Malware disguised as legit software.
  - User installs it thinking it‚Äôs safe.
  - Does **not ask for consent**; operates secretly once in.

- **PUPs / PUAs** (Potentially Unwanted Programs/Applications)
  - Often bundled with software installers.
  - May not be truly malicious, but often unwanted or shady.
  - Gray area: Installed via confusing license tricks, not direct deception like Trojans.

---

### üß± Malware Types by Payload

What the malware actually **does**:

- **Spyware**: Steals data secretly.
- **Rootkits**: Hide processes and elevate privileges.
- **RATs**: Remote Access Trojans; attacker gets control over the system.
- **Ransomware**: Locks or encrypts system; demands payment.

## üß† Modern Malware Tactics: Fileless Attacks

Fileless malware = üß± **memory-resident** + **diskless** tactics.

- Doesn‚Äôt write files to disk.
- Hides in memory, DLLs, or script hosts.
- May change **registry** to persist after reboot.
- Often triggered by script, email attachment, or trojan dropper.

---

### üîç Fileless Techniques

- **Shellcode**: Lightweight code injected into processes.
  - Often obfuscated, recompiled, streamed.
  - Enables backdoor, downloads other payloads.

- **"Living off the Land" (LotL)**
  - Uses **legit system tools** like:
    - PowerShell
    - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
  - Avoids detection by skipping custom binaries.
  - If attacker has permission, they can:
    - Scan, reconfigure, exfiltrate‚Äî**all with native tools**.

---

## üß† APTs, AVTs, and LOC Attacks

- **APT** (Advanced Persistent Threat)
- **AVT** (Advanced Volatile Threat)
  - Both describe persistent or memory-based attacks.
  - Often used in espionage or long-term cyber campaigns.

- **LOC** (Low Observable Characteristics)
  - Malware is designed to be **subtle**, not loud.
  - Avoids signatures, hides behavior.

üß† Key takeaway: Classifications aren‚Äôt the point. **Evading detection** is. Attackers constantly evolve‚Äîso should your defenses.
