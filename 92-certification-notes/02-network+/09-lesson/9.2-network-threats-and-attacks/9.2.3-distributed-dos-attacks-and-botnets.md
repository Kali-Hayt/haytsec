## 9.2.3 â€“ Distributed DoS Attacks and Botnets

---

## ðŸ§± Distributed DoS (DDoS)

- A **DDoS attack** is launched from **multiple hosts** simultaneously.
- Goals:
  - Consume **bandwidth**
  - Exhaust **CPU/memory resources**
  - Deny services to legitimate users

### Example: SYN Flood
- Attacker withholds the ACK during TCP 3-way handshake.
- IP is spoofed â†’ server responds to a fake or unreachable client.
- Server queues get filled with half-open connections.
- Eventually exhausts server capacity for new connections.

---

## Distributed Reflection/Amplification Attacks (DRDoS)

- A stronger variation of DDoS using **third-party servers** to reflect traffic.
- Attacker spoofs **victimâ€™s IP** and sends small requests to many servers.
- Those servers reply to the **victim**, flooding their network.

### Amplification
- Request: small
- Response: large (amplified)
- Example: DNS or NTP responses containing large payloads.

---

## Botnets

- A **botnet** = network of compromised devices (zombies).
- Controlled by attacker via a **C2 (Command and Control)** infrastructure.

### Botnet Structure
- **Handlers/herders**: initially compromised systems
- **Bots**: infected devices used to launch attacks
- Malware opens **remote backdoors**, giving attacker control.

### IoT Botnets
- Includes compromised smart devices: cameras, routers, TVs
- Often poorly secured and vulnerable to hijacking
