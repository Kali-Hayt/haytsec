# QUESTION 1  
**Which of the following best describes behavioral threat research?**

❌ A method for improving the encryption of data  
❌ A set of guidelines for installing security software  
✅ A commentary describing examples of attacks and TTPs  
❌ A database of all known computer viruses  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"A method for improving the encryption of data"* — That’s cryptographic research, not behavioral threat analysis.  
- ❌ *"A set of guidelines for installing security software"* — That’s policy or implementation guidance, not threat behavior-focused.  
- ❌ *"A database of all known computer viruses"* — Sounds like antivirus signature databases (e.g., virus definitions), not behavior/TTP analysis.

# QUESTION 2  
**What can be a source of internal threats?**

❌ Hackers from another country  
❌ Malware found on the Internet  
✅ Employees within the organization  
❌ Phishing emails from unknown senders  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"Hackers from another country"* — That’s clearly an **external threat**, not internal.  
- ❌ *"Malware found on the Internet"* — External in origin, even if an insider downloads it.  
- ❌ *"Phishing emails from unknown senders"* — External attackers using social engineering tactics, not insider-driven.  
---
# QUESTION 3  
**What distinguishes an external threat actor from an internal threat actor?**

✅ Whether they have authorized access to the system  
❌ The type of malware they use  
❌ The sophistication of the attack  
❌ The geographical location of the actor  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"The type of malware they use"* — Both internal and external actors can use the same malware tools.  
- ❌ *"The sophistication of the attack"* — Insider threats can be just as advanced or primitive as external ones.  
- ❌ *"The geographical location of the actor"* — Irrelevant; an internal threat can be remote (e.g., a remote employee). What matters is their **access level**.

# QUESTION 4  
**A cyber security technician responds to a department experiencing degraded network bandwidth, and customers call the department saying they cannot visit the company website.  
What is likely causing the issue?**

❌ DNS Poisoning  
✅ Distributed DoS (DDoS)  
❌ On-path attack  
❌ Malware  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"DNS Poisoning"* — That would misdirect traffic, not typically cause **bandwidth saturation** or site unavailability across the board.  
- ❌ *"On-path attack"* — This is more about **intercepting or modifying** data in transit, not flooding resources.  
- ❌ *"Malware"* — Malware may cause internal issues, but it doesn’t explain **external customers unable to access the site** plus **network-wide bandwidth degradation**.  
---
# QUESTION 5  
**What does the term "advanced persistent threat (APT)" refer to in the context of malware?**

❌ A basic form of malware that is easily detected and removed  
✅ A sophisticated malware attack that remains undetected  
❌ A type of antivirus software  
❌ A firewall feature that blocks all incoming traffic  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"A basic form of malware..."* — APTs are highly complex and stealthy, not basic or easy to remove.  
- ❌ *"A type of antivirus software"* — APT is an attack model, not a defense product.  
- ❌ *"A firewall feature..."* — APTs often bypass traditional defenses like firewalls by using stealthy tactics over time.

# QUESTION 6  
**What types of devices are vulnerable to becoming part of a botnet?**

❌ Only outdated computers  
❌ Devices without Internet access  
✅ Any type of Internet-enabled device  
❌ Only servers and mainframes  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"Only outdated computers"* — Even fully patched modern systems can be exploited, especially if misconfigured.  
- ❌ *"Devices without Internet access"* — If there's no network access, it can’t join a botnet.  
- ❌ *"Only servers and mainframes"* — Botnets often include IoT devices, smartphones, and even smart TVs — not just high-powered systems.  
---
# QUESTION 7  
**What is an example of an inadvertent vulnerability that users can create?**

❌ Regularly updating software and applications  
✅ Using shadow IT without authorization  
❌ Implementing strong encryption algorithms  
❌ Employing multi-factor authentication  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"Regularly updating software..."* — This is a best practice, not a vulnerability.  
- ❌ *"Implementing strong encryption algorithms"* — That strengthens security, not weakens it.  
- ❌ *"Employing multi-factor authentication"* — Adds layers of protection, not a vulnerability.  

---
# QUESTION 8  
**What is a Distributed Reflection DoS (DRDoS) attack?**

❌ An attack that directly targets the attacker's network  
❌ An attack that improves server reflection capabilities  
❌ A method to reduce network bandwidth consumption  
✅ A type of attack where the victim's IP address is spoofed  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"An attack that directly targets the attacker's network"* — That would be retaliation, not DRDoS.  
- ❌ *"An attack that improves server reflection capabilities"* — Misleading phrasing; this isn’t about optimization.  
- ❌ *"A method to reduce network bandwidth consumption"* — DRDoS actually consumes massive bandwidth.  

**DRDoS = attacker spoofs victim’s IP → sends requests to open servers → servers flood victim with replies.**  

---
# QUESTION 9  
**What does the payload of malware refer to?**

❌ The method by which the malware spreads  
❌ The amount of data the malware can steal  
❌ The size of the malware file  
✅ The malware action other than replication  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"The method by which the malware spreads"* — That describes the **vector**, not the payload.  
- ❌ *"The amount of data the malware can steal"* — Payload refers to **type of action**, not quantity of data.  
- ❌ *"The size of the malware file"* — File size doesn’t define function or impact.  

**Payload = what the malware actually *does*, such as keylogging, data exfiltration, or file encryption.**

# QUESTION 10  
**What is the primary difference between footprinting and fingerprinting in network attacks?**

❌ Fingerprinting is a legal method of gathering information, while footprinting is not.  
✅ Footprinting gathers general network information, while fingerprinting identifies specific device types.  
❌ Footprinting is used to enhance network security, while fingerprinting is used to decrease it.  
❌ Footprinting aims to improve network performance, while fingerprinting does not.  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"Fingerprinting is a legal method..."* — Legality depends on intent and context, not the tool itself.  
- ❌ *"Footprinting is used to enhance..."* — Both can be used for offense or defense; intent matters.  
- ❌ *"Footprinting aims to improve performance..."* — Neither technique is about performance optimization.  

**Footprinting = passive recon (who, what, where).  
Fingerprinting = active probing to ID OS, ports, services.**

# QUESTION 11  
**What is the primary goal of most adversaries when launching network attacks?**

✅ To steal information from the network  
❌ To enhance network performance  
❌ To provide free services to users  
❌ To improve network security  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"To enhance network performance"* — That’s a goal of IT, not attackers.  
- ❌ *"To provide free services to users"* — That’s altruism, not adversarial behavior.  
- ❌ *"To improve network security"* — Attackers try to break it, not fix it.  

**Most adversaries aim for data theft, system access, disruption, or financial gain.**

# QUESTION 12  
**What is the purpose of spoofing attacks?**

✅ To disguise the attacker's identity  
❌ To enhance the performance of ARP services  
❌ To improve the security of DNS services  
❌ To provide legitimate services to users  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"To enhance the performance of ARP services"* — Spoofing ARP poisons cache, it degrades performance and security.  
- ❌ *"To improve the security of DNS services"* — DNS spoofing is used to redirect traffic, not to secure it.  
- ❌ *"To provide legitimate services to users"* — Attackers impersonate legitimate sources to deceive, not to help.  

**Spoofing = deception. Hide identity, impersonate systems, and bypass controls.**

# QUESTION 13  
**What are Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)/Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs)?**

❌ Software that is always malicious but is installed without the user's consent  
❌ Applications that cannot be uninstalled by the user  
❌ Programs that enhance computer security without the user's knowledge  
✅ Software installed alongside a package selected by the user  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"Always malicious..."* — PUPs aren’t always malicious; they’re often just shady or deceptive.  
- ❌ *"Cannot be uninstalled..."* — Many PUPs **can** be removed; the issue is **how** they got there.  
- ❌ *"Enhance security without the user’s knowledge..."* — That would be unorthodox behavior for legit tools, but not how PUPs are defined.  

**PUPs often piggyback on legit installs — toolbars, trackers, bloatware, etc.**

# QUESTION 14  
**What is malware?**

❌ A type of computer hardware that performs poorly  
❌ Software designed to protect computer networks  
❌ A beneficial software tool that enhances system performance  
✅ Software that performs malicious actions  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"Hardware that performs poorly"* — Malware is **software**, not hardware.  
- ❌ *"Software designed to protect..."* — That’s security software, the opposite of malware.  
- ❌ *"Beneficial software tool..."* — Malware is intentionally harmful, not helpful.  

**Malware = malicious + software. It's designed to exploit, damage, steal, or disrupt.**

---
# QUESTION 15  
**How are botnets typically created?**

❌ Through the use of strong passwords  
✅ Through malware that opens a backdoor  
❌ By updating devices with the latest firmware  
❌ By installing security software on devices  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *"Strong passwords"* — Strong passwords **prevent** unauthorized access; they don’t create botnets.  
- ❌ *"Updating firmware"* — That’s a security **best practice**, not an attack vector.  
- ❌ *"Installing security software"* — Security software helps **defend** against botnets, not create them.  

**Botnets are typically formed when malware opens a backdoor, allowing attackers to control the infected device remotely.**
