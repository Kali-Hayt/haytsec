## ✅ Lab 9.2.6 – Analyze a DDoS Attack

### 🎯 Objective
Detect signs of a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack using packet analysis.

---

### 🧱 Tasks Completed

- [x] **Filtered for SYN-only packets**
  ```wireshark
  tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0
  ```
- [x] **Filtered for SYN-ACK packets**
  ```wireshark
  tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==1
  ```
- [x] **Filtered for ACK-only packets**
  ```wireshark
  tcp.flags.syn==0 and tcp.flags.ack==1
  ```
- [x] Identified that **destination IP `198.28.1.1`** was being overwhelmed.

---

### 🧠 Key Indicators of DDoS (vs. DoS)

- ❗ **Multiple source IP addresses** sending **SYNs** to a single destination = **DDoS**
- ❗ Very few SYN-ACKs returned = target overwhelmed, unable to respond
- ❗ ACKs missing = No completed handshakes = **half-open connections**
- Target = `www.corpnet.xyz` → IP `198.28.1.1`

### ✅ Lab Question

> **Q:** Which sign indicates this is a *distributed* denial-of-service (DDoS) attack?  
> **✔ Your Answer:** There are multiple source addresses for the SYN packets with the destination address 198.28.1.1.  
> **✔ Correct Answer:** Same.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used

- **Wireshark**: Real-time packet filtering
- **TCP Flags Filters** to isolate:
  - SYN-only packets (initiation attempts)
  - SYN-ACKs (server responses)
  - ACKs (final handshake step)

---

### 🔒 Real-World Defenses

- Use **rate limiting** or SYN cookies
- Geo/IP filtering if attack sources are spoofed
- Deploy **load balancers** or **reverse proxies** to absorb DDoS traffic
- Integrate with **cloud-based DDoS protection services**

---

### 💯 Result

> Score: **100%**  
> Time: 08:51  
> Outcome: Successfully identified DDoS based on **SYN storm with varied sources**.
