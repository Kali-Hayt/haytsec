## 9.3.1 – On-Path Attacks 🧠

### What is an On-Path Attack?
- A spoofing attack where a threat actor sits between two systems.
- Intercepts and relays all communications.
- May modify traffic before relaying it.

✅ Previously called **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**.  
🆕 Referred to as:
- Manipulator in the Middle
- Machine in the Middle
- Adversary in the Middle (AitM)

### MAC & IP Spoofing

- Attackers forge a MAC or IP to impersonate another device.
- Done using packet crafting tools.
- Goal: bypass access control or trick the network.

⚠️ May cause unpredictable results (e.g., duplicate addresses).

💡 **IP spoofing in DoS**: Hides source of attack. No replies expected, unlike on-path.

---

### ARP Spoofing & ARP Poisoning

- **ARP Spoofing**: Sends fake ARP replies to redirect traffic.
- **ARP Poisoning**: Injects fake MAC:IP into ARP cache.

🎯 Target = subnet’s gateway (to intercept traffic).
🛠 Used to monitor or modify packets (on-path behavior).
☠️ Can cause DoS if traffic isn’t forwarded.

🕵️ Detection Tips:
- Check ARP cache for duplicate MACs.
- Use packet capture to find rogue ARP replies.

🧱 ARP vs ARP Poisoning:
- Spoofing = unsolicited ARP replies.
- Poisoning = injecting fake mappings.

### IPv6 Spoofing Warning

- IPv6 doesn’t use ARP, but still vulnerable.
- **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)** can be abused.
- Router Advertisement (RA) spoofing is a risk.
