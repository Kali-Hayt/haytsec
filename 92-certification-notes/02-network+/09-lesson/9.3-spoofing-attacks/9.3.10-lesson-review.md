# QUESTION 1  
**What feature of 802.1Q do VLAN hopping attacks exploit?**  
❌ Access control lists (ACLs)  
❌ Port security  
✅ Native VLANs  
❌ Port mirroring  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Access control lists (ACLs):** These manage traffic rules, not VLAN tagging behavior. VLAN hopping bypasses VLAN separation, not traffic filtering.
- ❌ **Port security:** Prevents unauthorized MACs, but doesn’t stop crafted VLAN tags or trunk impersonation.
- ❌ **Port mirroring:** Used for monitoring; not related to VLAN tag handling or spoofing.

🧱 VLAN hopping exploits how **Native VLANs** are handled on trunk links. If a switch accepts untagged traffic on the native VLAN, an attacker can send frames that sneak into other VLANs, especially when misconfigured.

# QUESTION 2  
**What is the result of a successful ARP poisoning attack?**  
❌ The attacker's device is disconnected from the network.  
❌ The network's speed is significantly increased.  
❌ All network traffic is encrypted automatically.  
✅ The attacker receives all traffic destined for remote networks.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The attacker's device is disconnected:** Quite the opposite—it's now *in the path* between devices.
- ❌ **Network speed increases:** Nope, ARP poisoning usually slows things down slightly due to redirection and inspection.
- ❌ **Traffic is encrypted automatically:** Encryption must be implemented separately; ARP spoofing doesn't provide security—it breaks it.

🧱 ARP poisoning tricks devices into sending their traffic to the attacker instead of the legitimate gateway—classic man-in-the-middle (MITM).

# QUESTION 3  
**What is the primary difference between ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning?**  
✅ ARP spoofing involves broadcasting fake ARP messages, while ARP poisoning refers to the state of the ARP cache.  
❌ ARP spoofing is a passive attack while ARP poisoning is an active attack.  
❌ ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning are terms for the same process, with no difference between them.  
❌ ARP poisoning is used to secure network communications, whereas ARP spoofing is a malicious activity.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Passive vs. active:** Both are active forms of attack—there’s no passive ARP spoofing.
- ❌ **Same term:** They’re related but not identical; spoofing is the action, poisoning is the result.
- ❌ **Used to secure networks:** ARP poisoning is *always* malicious—never used for protection.

🧱 Think of spoofing as the trick, and poisoning as the impact it has.

# QUESTION 4  
**What is an on-path attack?**  
✅ A type of spoofing attack where a threat actor intercepts communications between two hosts.  
❌ A cyber-attack that exclusively targets the path of data storage devices.  
❌ An attack where the threat actor creates a new path in a network to reroute data.  
❌ A type of physical attack where the attacker physically intercepts a data transmission.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Storage devices:** On-path attacks aren’t about storage; they’re about live network traffic.
- ❌ **Creates a new path:** The attacker doesn't *create* a new route—they insert themselves *into* the existing one.
- ❌ **Physical attack:** It’s usually done via software, not by cutting cables or plugging in.

🕵️ Think of an on-path attacker like a spy who secretly listens in on a phone call without either party knowing.

# QUESTION 5  
**What is the primary purpose of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) in a network?**  
✅ To prevent switching loops  
❌ To facilitate VLAN hopping attacks  
❌ To encrypt traffic between switches  
❌ To increase network bandwidth  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **VLAN hopping attacks:** STP isn’t a vulnerability—it's a protection mechanism for Layer 2 loops.
- ❌ **Encrypt traffic:** STP doesn’t provide encryption; it manages logical paths.
- ❌ **Increase bandwidth:** STP actually *blocks* some redundant links to prevent loops, which may reduce bandwidth in certain topologies.

🧱 STP's job is to stop a switch flood storm caused by loops. It's like a traffic cop directing flow to prevent gridlock.

# QUESTION 6  
**What is the primary purpose of ARP poisoning in an on-path attack?**  
✅ To redirect traffic through the attacker  
❌ To encrypt all data packets on the network  
❌ To increase the efficiency of the ARP protocol  
❌ To physically damage the network infrastructure  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encryption:** ARP poisoning doesn’t secure traffic—it does the opposite by exposing it.
- ❌ **Efficiency:** Poisoning corrupts the ARP cache, *decreasing* efficiency.
- ❌ **Physical damage:** It’s a logical attack, not one that fries hardware.

🧠 ARP poisoning tricks devices into sending traffic to the attacker’s MAC instead of the real gateway—like rerouting someone's mail to a fake address.

# QUESTION 7  
**What happens when a switch's MAC address table is overwhelmed due to a MAC flooding attack?**  
✅ The switch begins to function as a hub.  
❌ The switch only forwards traffic to the attacker's port.  
❌ The switch increases its memory capacity automatically.  
❌ The switch automatically shuts down for security reasons.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Forward to attacker only:** The switch floods traffic *everywhere*, not just to the attacker.
- ❌ **Memory increase:** Switches don’t auto-upgrade—they just panic when full.
- ❌ **Shutdown:** Most unmanaged switches don’t have security mechanisms that force a shutdown.

🧱 MAC flooding overflows the CAM (MAC) table. The switch forgets where devices are and sends all frames out every port—like a hub—making eavesdropping easy.

# QUESTION 8  
**How do attackers exploit the native VLAN feature in a VLAN hopping attack?**  
✅ By crafting a frame with two VLAN tag headers  
❌ By deleting the native VLAN from the switch configuration  
❌ By sending a frame with three VLAN tag headers  
❌ By encrypting the traffic sent to the native VLAN  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Deleting native VLAN:** That’s a defense, not an attack method.
- ❌ **Three VLAN headers:** VLAN tags are 802.1Q standard—double tagging is the trick, not triple.
- ❌ **Encrypting traffic:** VLAN hopping is about manipulating switch behavior, not encryption.

🧱 VLAN hopping via double-tagging:
1. First tag = attacker's VLAN.
2. Second (inner) tag = victim VLAN.
Some switches strip the first tag and forward it as if it came from a native VLAN—letting attackers *hop*.

# QUESTION 9  
**What is MAC spoofing?**  
✅ Changing the MAC address of a network interface to any arbitrary value  
❌ Intercepting MAC addresses during data transmission  
❌ Using malware to reveal the MAC address of a device  
❌ Physically altering the network interface to change its MAC address  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Intercepting MAC addresses:** That’s passive sniffing, not spoofing. Spoofing is *active deception*.  
- ❌ **Using malware:** You don’t need malware to spoof—MAC addresses are easy to view with basic tools.  
- ❌ **Physically altering hardware:** Totally unnecessary. Spoofing is done in software (e.g., `ip link set`, `macchanger`).

🧱 MAC spoofing = fake ID badge for your network card.
Used to bypass MAC filtering or impersonate a trusted device.

# QUESTION 10  
**What is VLAN hopping?**  
✅ An attack designed to send traffic to a VLAN other than the one the host system is in  
❌ A method to increase the speed of VLAN traffic  
❌ A technique to reduce network congestion  
❌ A security feature of 802.1Q to enhance VLAN compatibility  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Speed increase:** VLAN hopping is not a performance feature—it's a security exploit.  
- ❌ **Reduce congestion:** Again, not a traffic management tool. It's a method of bypassing segmentation.  
- ❌ **802.1Q feature:** VLAN hopping abuses 802.1Q—it’s not a designed feature.

🧱 VLAN hopping = jumping the fence between VLANs, often by exploiting native VLAN misconfig or double-tagging.
