# QUESTION 1  
Which of the following is true about port scanning?

❌ It is a method to enhance the performance of web servers.  
❌ It is used to decrease network security.  
❌ It is a technique used to reduce network bandwidth usage.  
✅ It aims to enumerate the TCP or UDP application ports on a host.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Enhancing web server performance* has nothing to do with scanning; that’s optimization.  
- ❌ *Decreasing network security* is not the purpose of scanning—though attackers may use it for that.  
- ❌ *Reducing bandwidth usage* is unrelated; port scanning increases temporary bandwidth use.

# QUESTION 2  
What is the role of a rogue DHCP server in DNS attacks?

❌ To steal user credentials through DNS queries  
❌ To physically damage DNS servers  
✅ To configure clients with the address of a DNS resolver controlled by the attacker  
❌ To encrypt all DNS traffic  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Stealing credentials through DNS queries* is indirect at best—not DHCP's role.  
- ❌ *Physically damaging servers* is not what DHCP does—this is a logical layer attack.  
- ❌ *Encrypting DNS traffic* is a defensive measure (like DNS over HTTPS), not an attack function.

# QUESTION 3  
What is the baseline in the context of a vulnerability assessment?

❌ The default settings of a software application  
✅ The ideal configuration state of a system  
❌ The minimum level of security required by law  
❌ The highest level of security achievable  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Default settings* often include insecure configurations—not ideal.  
- ❌ *Minimum legal security* is compliance, not a baseline for assessment.  
- ❌ *Highest security achievable* is aspirational, not baseline—it’s often impractical.

# QUESTION 4  
You receive a phone call from a woman who states that she is calling from your bank. She tells you that someone has tried to access your checking account, and she needs you to confirm your account number and password to discuss further details.  
You give her your account number and password.  
Which of the following types of non-technical password attacks has occurred?

❌ Password guessing  
❌ Dumpster diving  
✅ Social engineering  
❌ Shoulder surfing  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Password guessing* involves brute force or dictionaries—not phone calls.  
- ❌ *Dumpster diving* involves digging through trash for sensitive info.  
- ❌ *Shoulder surfing* requires visually spying on you—not verbal manipulation.

---
# QUESTION 5  
What poses a greater threat than zero-day vulnerabilities?

✅ Unpatched or legacy systems  
❌ Newly released software  
❌ Strong password policies  
❌ Encrypted data storage  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *New software* might introduce risk, but legacy systems with known flaws are worse.  
- ❌ *Strong password policies* help security—they don’t pose a threat.  
- ❌ *Encrypted data storage* is a defense, not a risk factor.

# QUESTION 6  
An organization wants to enhance its network security to prevent on-path attacks, specifically targeting ARP spoofing techniques.  
Which of the following measures would be most effective?

❌ Implementing a strict email filtering system  
✅ Enabling Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on switches  
❌ Increasing password complexity requirements  
❌ Regularly updating antivirus software on all devices  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Email filtering* helps with phishing—not ARP spoofing.  
- ❌ *Password complexity* protects authentication—not ARP table integrity.  
- ❌ *Antivirus* is useful, but ARP spoofing is a network-layer attack, not endpoint malware.

----
# QUESTION 7  
Which of the following are examples of social engineering attacks? (Select two.)

❌ War dialing  
❌ Port scanning  
✅ Dumpster diving  
✅ Shoulder surfing  
❌ Impersonation  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *War dialing* is a technical attack that dials a range of phone numbers to find modems—no human manipulation involved.  
- ❌ *Port scanning* probes systems for open ports—purely a technical reconnaissance method.  
- ❌ *Impersonation* **is** social engineering, but the question specifically asked for **two**. You selected three and missed *Shoulder surfing*, which is the correct second answer.

🧠 Social engineering = manipulating humans.  
- Dumpster diving = digging through trash for sensitive info.  
- Shoulder surfing = peeking over someone’s shoulder for credentials.

---
# QUESTION 8  
What is the role of a "handler" in a botnet?

✅ To manage the bots and coordinate attacks  
❌ To update bots with the latest security patches  
❌ To monitor network traffic for anomalies  
❌ To secure the network from external threats  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Security patches* aren't the goal—botnets exploit, not protect.  
- ❌ *Monitoring for anomalies* is a blue team activity, not attacker behavior.  
- ❌ *Securing the network* is what defenders do—botnet handlers are attackers.

# QUESTION 9  
You are the IT security manager for a mid-sized corporation. One morning, several employees report that when they try to access the company’s internal portal, they are redirected to an external website that looks similar but asks for their credentials. You suspect a DNS spoofing attack.  
What would be the MOST immediate and effective actions to take? (Select two.)

❌ Increase the security settings on the corporate firewall.  
❌ Update antivirus software on all employee computers.  
✅ Scan the network for rogue DHCP servers.  
✅ Inspect DNS traffic for anomalies.  
❌ Instruct all employees to restart their computers.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Firewall settings* don’t detect or mitigate DNS spoofing.  
- ❌ *Antivirus updates* don’t detect DNS poisoning on the network level.  
- ❌ *Restarting computers* doesn’t reset rogue DNS server assignments.  
- ✅ *Rogue DHCP servers* may be handing out malicious DNS resolvers.  
- ✅ *DNS traffic inspection* helps detect mismatched or redirected queries.

---
# QUESTION 10  
Which password cracking method uses a list of pre-defined words or phrases to guess passwords?

✅ Dictionary  
❌ Phishing  
❌ Brute Force  
❌ Keylogging  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Phishing* tricks users into revealing passwords; it doesn’t guess them.  
- ❌ *Brute force* tries every possible character combination, not just known words.  
- ❌ *Keylogging* records keystrokes—it doesn’t use a predefined list to guess.

---
# QUESTION 11  
Which of the following is NOT a method used in VLAN hopping attacks?

✅ Utilizing strong encryption algorithms  
❌ Exploiting the native VLAN feature  
❌ Negotiating the creation of a trunk port  
❌ Manipulating the Spanning Tree Protocol  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ✅ *Encryption algorithms* have nothing to do with VLAN hopping—totally unrelated layer.  
- ❌ *Native VLAN exploits* can allow attackers to access unintended VLANs.  
- ❌ *Trunk port negotiation* (via DTP) is a known VLAN hopping technique.  
- ❌ *Manipulating STP* can assist VLAN-based movement or traffic manipulation.

---
# QUESTION 12  
What is one of the key benefits of using a honeypot or honeynet in cybersecurity?

❌ Reducing the need for other security measures  
✅ Providing an early warning of attacks  
❌ Increasing the encryption strength  
❌ Completely eliminating cyber threats  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Reducing other security measures* is risky—honeypots are supplementary, not replacements.  
- ❌ *Encryption strength* has nothing to do with honeypots.  
- ❌ *Completely eliminating threats* is impossible—honeypots detect, delay, and study attacks.

---
# QUESTION 13  
How can ARP spoofing be detected?

❌ By observing an increase in network speed.  
❌ ARP spoofing cannot be detected.  
❌ By waiting for the network to automatically correct the issue.  
✅ By monitoring for sporadic communications difficulties.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Increased network speed* isn't a symptom—ARP spoofing usually causes **delays or data loss**.  
- ❌ *Undetectable* is false—tools like `arpwatch`, `XArp`, and IDS systems can flag spoofed MAC/IP mismatches.  
- ❌ *Waiting for auto-correction* is passive and dangerous. ARP spoofing **requires active detection and response**.

---
# QUESTION 14  
What is a honeypot in the context of cybersecurity?

❌ A software tool used for encrypting data  
❌ A type of malware designed to steal data  
✅ A computer system set up to attract attackers  
❌ A firewall configuration technique

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Encryption tools* protect data—they don’t deceive or observe attackers.  
- ❌ *Malware* is offensive; honeypots are defensive deception tools.  
- ❌ *Firewall configs* are about controlling traffic, not luring malicious users.

# QUESTION 15  
During a routine check, a network security analyst notices an unusual spike in outbound traffic from the company's network to various external IP addresses.  
Upon further investigation, it is discovered that this traffic is primarily composed of DNS response packets.  
Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this anomaly, and what could be its potential impact on the company’s network?

❌ A SYN Flood attack targeting the company's web servers; could cause web service disruptions.  
❌ A successful phishing campaign; could lead to data exfiltration and system compromise.  
✅ A Distributed Reflection DoS (DRDoS) attack utilizing DNS amplification; could lead to network bandwidth saturation.  
❌ An internal DNS server misconfiguration; could result in DNS resolution failures for internal users.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *SYN floods* target **inbound** connections, not responsible for outbound DNS floods.  
- ❌ *Phishing* is more about user credentials, not anomalous DNS response traffic.  
- ❌ *DNS misconfig* would cause name resolution issues, not external response spam.

🧱 DRDoS with DNS amplification uses internal servers to bounce large DNS replies off spoofed queries, flooding targets—hence the outbound spike.

---
# QUESTION 16  
A security analyst is looking at attacks against unencrypted Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol.  
What is the attacker most likely trying to accomplish?

❌ ARP cache poisoning  
✅ Layer 2 spoofing  
❌ Evil twin  
❌ VLAN hopping  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *ARP cache poisoning* applies to IPv4 and the ARP protocol, not IPv6’s ND.  
- ❌ *Evil twin* refers to rogue Wi-Fi access points, unrelated to Neighbor Discovery.  
- ❌ *VLAN hopping* exploits VLAN trunking misconfigs, not ND or Layer 2 spoofing.

🧱 ND in IPv6 serves a similar role to ARP in IPv4. Attacking it often involves spoofing MAC addresses to intercept or disrupt traffic—**Layer 2 spoofing** by nature.

---
# QUESTION 17  
What does end-to-end encryption, such as IPSec or TLS, secure against?

✅ Recovery of password hashes  
❌ Only unauthorized logins  
❌ Only physical access to data  
❌ Viruses and malware  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Only unauthorized logins* – E2EE protects data in transit, not account access controls directly.  
- ❌ *Only physical access to data* – Physical attacks bypass E2EE by accessing endpoints directly.  
- ❌ *Viruses and malware* – Encryption can’t stop malware; that’s the job of endpoint protection, not TLS/IPSec.

🧱 End-to-end encryption like TLS/IPSec encrypts the payload between endpoints—preventing interception or recovery of *transmitted* sensitive data (like password hashes) in transit, even over untrusted networks.

---
# QUESTION 18  
During a routine network audit, a network administrator notices that several clients are experiencing connectivity issues and are unable to access external websites.  
Upon investigation, it is discovered that these clients have IP addresses and DNS server settings that do not align with the organization’s standard network configuration.

What is the MOST likely cause of this issue?

✅ A rogue DHCP server is present on the network.  
❌ The main DHCP server has run out of IP addresses to assign.  
❌ The firewall is blocking access to the organization’s DNS servers.  
❌ The clients have manually configured IP settings that are incorrect.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Main DHCP server out of IPs* – Would likely lead to no IP assignment (APIPA), not *incorrect* ones.  
- ❌ *Firewall blocking DNS* – That would affect DNS resolution, not change clients’ *assigned settings*.  
- ❌ *Manually configured IPs* – Unlikely across *several* clients unless intentional misconfiguration.  

🧱 A rogue DHCP server hands out bogus IP/DNS settings, often redirecting clients to malicious resources or causing denial of service by breaking routing.

---
# QUESTION 19  
What is the primary goal of implementing security policies within an organization?

❌ To increase the organization’s revenue  
❌ To eliminate all risks facing the organization  
❌ To ensure compliance with legal requirements  
✅ To mitigate risks associated with network systems  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Increase revenue* – Security *supports* revenue protection but isn’t revenue-generating in itself.  
- ❌ *Eliminate all risks* – Impossible. Security aims for *risk reduction*, not elimination.  
- ❌ *Ensure legal compliance* – That’s one objective, but not the *primary* goal of security policies.  

🧱 Security policies exist to *manage and reduce* risk to acceptable levels while enabling the business to operate safely and efficiently.

---
# QUESTION 20  
What is the primary difference between DNS spoofing and DNS poisoning?

❌ Spoofing is a legal method of redirecting traffic, while poisoning is not  
❌ Spoofing targets only private networks, while poisoning targets public networks  
✅ Spoofing uses false DNS requests, while poisoning manipulates cached records  
❌ Spoofing involves physical attacks on DNS servers, while poisoning does not  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Legal vs illegal* – That’s a legal distinction, not a technical one. Both are attacks.  
- ❌ *Private vs public* – Both attacks can happen on *any* network, private or public.  
- ❌ *Physical attacks* – DNS spoofing and poisoning are both logical/software-based, not physical tampering.  

🧱 **DNS Spoofing**: Fake responses sent to DNS queries in real time.  
🧱 **DNS Poisoning**: Corrupting the DNS cache so future queries return malicious results.

---
# QUESTION 21  
What is an on-path attack?

❌ A cyber-attack that exclusively targets the path of data storage devices.  
❌ An attack where the threat actor creates a new path in a network to reroute data.  
❌ A type of physical attack where the attacker physically intercepts a data transmission.  
✅ A type of spoofing attack where a threat actor intercepts communications between two hosts.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Data storage path* – This has nothing to do with MITM-style interception. It's a red herring.  
- ❌ *Creating a new path* – On-path doesn’t reroute by design; it hijacks existing sessions.  
- ❌ *Physical interception* – While physical access can be part of a broader attack, on-path attacks are usually logical/virtual.  

🧱 **On-path = Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**  
Think of it like a mail thief standing between sender and receiver, reading and possibly modifying the letters.

# QUESTION 22  
As a network administrator, you've been alerted to unusual network traffic patterns and suspect a DNS cache poisoning attack on your company's DNS server.  
Which of the following steps would be MOST effective in confirming and addressing the attack?

❌ Disable the DNS server and switch to a public DNS service temporarily.  
❌ Increase the bandwidth allocation to the DNS server to handle the increased traffic.  
✅ Clear the DNS cache on the server and monitor.  
❌ Instruct all users to change their passwords immediately.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Switching to public DNS* sidesteps the issue but doesn't confirm or resolve the root cause on your infrastructure. Not ideal in a corporate setup.  
- ❌ *Increasing bandwidth* doesn’t stop poisoning — it ignores the real problem and just adds resources.  
- ❌ *Password changes* are premature unless credential theft has been confirmed — and not directly related to DNS cache poisoning.  

🧱 DNS cache poisoning = corrupt DNS responses stored in cache  
To fix: flush the cache, monitor logs, revalidate with trusted upstream DNS.

# QUESTION 23  
A cyber security technician responds to a department experiencing degraded network bandwidth, and customers call the department saying they cannot visit the company website.  
What is likely causing the issue?

❌ DNS Poisoning  
✅ Distributed DoS (DDoS)  
❌ On-path attack  
❌ Malware  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *DNS poisoning* would typically misdirect users to the wrong site, not necessarily cause bandwidth degradation.  
- ❌ *On-path attack* (a.k.a. MITM) might intercept traffic, but again, wouldn’t normally saturate bandwidth or make a site inaccessible.  
- ❌ *Malware* might slow systems or exfiltrate data but not usually flood network traffic or crash external access like a DDoS.

🧱 DDoS = flooding a service with traffic → degraded bandwidth + site unavailability = classic symptoms.

# QUESTION 24  
A network administrator is dealing with a security breach. The malware involved does not write its code to disk but uses memory-resident techniques and legitimate system scripting tools to execute payload actions.  
Which of the following best describes this type of malware?

✅ Fileless malware  
❌ Virus  
❌ PUP  
❌ Worm  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Virus* needs to write to disk and attach to a host file—doesn't match memory-resident behavior.  
- ❌ *PUP* (Potentially Unwanted Program) refers to annoying, usually non-malicious software like adware—this isn't a breach tool.  
- ❌ *Worm* replicates itself across networks and typically leaves traces—fileless malware doesn't persist like that.

🔍 Fileless malware = stealthy + lives in RAM + evades traditional antivirus tools.

---
# QUESTION 25  
Which protocol might allow a threat actor to obtain password hashes if not configured with encryption?

❌ SSH  
❌ HTTPS  
❌ TLS  
✅ SMB  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *SSH* is encrypted by default; it doesn't leak hashes unless you mess up key management.  
- ❌ *HTTPS* rides on top of TLS and encrypts HTTP traffic—again, safe if configured correctly.  
- ❌ *TLS* is the encryption layer itself—disabling it breaks security, but it’s not the source of password leaks.

🔍 **SMB** (especially older versions like SMBv1) transmits NTLM hashes during authentication. If not hardened, attackers can intercept or relay those for pass-the-hash or cracking attacks.
