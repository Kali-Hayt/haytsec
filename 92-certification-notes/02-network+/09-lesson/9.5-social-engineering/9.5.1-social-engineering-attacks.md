## 9.5.1 – Social Engineering Attacks

### What is Social Engineering?
- “Hacking the human” – exploiting trust instead of technical flaws.
- Can be **passive** (e.g. shoulder surfing) or **active** (e.g. impersonation).
- Often the first stage of an attack to gather insider info.

### Types of Social Engineering Attacks

#### ✅ Impersonation
- Attacker pretends to be someone trusted (e.g. IT support).
- Objective: gain sensitive info or system access.

#### ✅ Phishing
- Fake emails or websites lure users into giving up credentials or installing malware.
- Common form: spoofed websites mimicking banks, stores, or email providers.

#### ✅ Shoulder Surfing
- Watching someone type passwords/PINs in public.
- Doesn’t require close distance—CCTV/binoculars may be used.

#### ✅ Tailgating
- Attacker follows an authorized person into a secure area.

#### ✅ Piggybacking
- Similar to tailgating, but the authorized user knowingly assists the intruder (often under false pretenses).

#### ✅ Dumpster Diving
- Searching through trash for useful info (e.g. documents, storage media).

### Key Concept
🧱 **Social engineering bypasses firewalls by exploiting people.**

### Defensive Tips
- Always verify identities.
- Don't click suspicious links or share credentials.
- Shred sensitive docs.
- Report unusual behavior or unauthorized visitors.
