You are the IT security administrator. Your task: sort email threats from safe correspondence.

## ✅ What to Delete (Malicious)

### 🟡 Phishing
- **Microsoft Windows Update Center**
  - Spelling errors + fake link = classic phishing red flag.
- **Riverdale Estates HOA (Payment Pending)**
  - Link leads to an unknown IP, not the legit credit union site.

### 🟣 Spear Phishing
- **Daisy Knudsen – Web Site Update**
  - Fake colleague email, executable link from a Russian domain = 🚩🚩

### 🔴 Whaling
- **Executive Recruiting – Executive Jobs**
  - Targets execs, link likely installs malware to capture sensitive data.

### ⚫ Malicious Attachments
- **Jim Haws – Re: Lunch Today?**
  - Pretends to be a colleague, dodges context, includes suspicious attachment.
- **Rachelle Hancock – “Wow!!”**
  - “Dear Friend” + attachment = probably not a gift.

### ⚠️ Hoaxes
- **Grandma White – Virus Attack Warning**
- **Grandma White – Free Airline Tickets**
  - Both are chain email hoaxes urging mass forwarding, usually containing fake alerts or fake offers.

---

## ✅ What to Keep (Safe)

### 🧩 Human Resources
- **Ethics Video**
  - Digitally signed, verified sender, secure corporate link.
- **IMPORTANT NOTICE – Action Required**
  - No suspicious attachments or links. Legit internal directive.

### 🎃 Activities Committee – Pumpkin Contest
- No links or attachments = Safe

### 🧑‍🏫 Bob Averez – Presentation
- No clickable elements = Safe

## 🔍 Pro Tips from This Lab

- Hover over links to **check the real URL**.
- Look for **context mismatch** (e.g., "Lunch?" email with a random attachment).
- Watch for **emotional triggers** – urgency, reward, fear.
- Digitally signed emails from verified internal domains are generally safe.
- Chain letters and “send this to everyone” emails = **immediate delete**.

---

## 🧠 Memory Hooks

- **Phishing** = baited link.
- **Spear Phishing** = "I know you" + malware link.
- **Whaling** = exec-targeted + high stakes.
- **Malicious Attachment** = "Open me!" from someone sketchy.
- **Hoax** = “FWD: FWD: Virus warning” vibes.
