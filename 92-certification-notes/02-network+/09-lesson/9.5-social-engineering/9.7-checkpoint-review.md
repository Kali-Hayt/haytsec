# QUESTION 1

What is the purpose of the detection phase in a PoE switch?

❌ To encrypt the data being transmitted to the device  
❌ To determine the optimal data transmission rate  
✅ To identify whether the connected device is PoE-enabled and determine its power consumption  
❌ To test the strength of the Ethernet cable  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Encrypting data* is handled by higher-layer protocols like TLS or IPsec, not part of PoE functions.
- ❌ *Determining data rate* is part of auto-negotiation, unrelated to power delivery.
- ❌ *Testing cable strength* is not a function of PoE detection; that would fall under cable certification tools or signal quality checks.

# QUESTION 2

You own a small business and have decided to set up a network where each computer acts as both a client and a server.

What type of network would BEST meet your requirements?

❌ Client-Server network  
❌ Enterprise network  
❌ Virtual Private network  
✅ Peer-to-Peer network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Client-Server network* uses centralized servers—opposite of decentralized. Clients request, servers provide.
- ❌ *Enterprise network* refers to the scale and management complexity, not the architecture type.
- ❌ *Virtual Private Network (VPN)* is about secure remote access, not network role distribution.

# QUESTION 3

What is the primary difference between Quality of Service (QoS) and Class of Service (CoS)?

✅ QoS provides fine-grained control over traffic parameters, while CoS categorizes protocols into groups.  
❌ QoS categorizes protocols into groups, while CoS allows fine-grained control over traffic parameters.  
❌ CoS is used exclusively for packet switching, while QoS is used for both packet and frame switching.  
❌ CoS allows for the reservation of bandwidth, while QoS does not.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *QoS categorizes into groups* → reversed; that's CoS. QoS deals with traffic shaping, latency, jitter.
- ❌ *CoS used exclusively for packet switching* → CoS applies to Layer 2 (frame-level), not just packet switching.
- ❌ *CoS allows bandwidth reservation, QoS does not* → incorrect; QoS can reserve bandwidth through mechanisms like RSVP.

# QUESTION 4

A network engineer is tasked with optimizing a company’s network to support a new VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) system. The company wants to ensure that voice calls are clear and free of delays.

The network currently supports data transfers at high speeds, but there are concerns about the consistency of these speeds during peak operational hours.

Based on the distinction between speed and throughput as described in the uploaded document, what should the engineer prioritize to meet the company’s requirements?

✅ Ensuring the network’s throughput remains consistent during peak hours  
❌ Increasing the baud rate of the network’s physical layer  
❌ Reducing the distance between network switches to minimize attenuation  
❌ Focusing solely on increasing the network’s bit rate  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Baud rate* affects signaling, not overall throughput. VoIP performance suffers from inconsistency, not signal rate.
- ❌ *Reducing distance between switches* helps slightly with signal integrity but doesn’t solve congestion or traffic spikes.
- ❌ *Bit rate increase* boosts *potential* speed, but if throughput dips during peak usage, it won’t help VoIP consistency.

🧱 Throughput = actual delivered performance  
🧱 Bit rate = theoretical maximum  
🔍 VoIP needs consistent delivery, not just speed

# QUESTION 5

A small business is expanding its office space and plans to deploy VoIP phones to support its growing workforce. The IT manager wants to ensure that the network is optimized for both voice and data traffic without having to run additional cabling for the new workstations and phones.

The existing network infrastructure includes switches that support voice VLANs and the use of protocols like Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) for automatic configuration.

Which of the following steps should the IT manager take to optimize the network for the deployment of VoIP phones and workstations?

✅ Connect each workstation to a VoIP phone, and then connect the VoIP phone to a switch port configured with a voice VLAN.  
❌ Connect each VoIP phone directly to a switch port and connect each workstation to a separate switch port.  
❌ Disable CDP on the switches to prevent automatic configuration and manually set up each VoIP phone and workstation.  
❌ Configure all switch ports as trunk ports to allow both voice and data traffic.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Using two separate ports for each device wastes switch ports and cabling—inefficient and unnecessary.
- ❌ Disabling CDP undermines automatic VLAN assignment; you'd lose the benefit of automation.
- ❌ Trunk ports are not used for access-layer ports to end-user devices; they're meant for switch-to-switch or switch-to-router connections.

🧱 The correct approach is to daisy-chain: workstation → VoIP phone → switch  
🧱 CDP enables the phone to negotiate voice VLAN while allowing data traffic passthrough for the workstation  
✅ This saves ports and ensures traffic separation via VLANs

# QUESTION 6

A network engineer deploys a hardware appliance to distribute client requests across server nodes in a farm or pool.

What is the name of this appliance?

✅ Load Balancer  
❌ Virtual IP  
❌ Multipathing  
❌ Hot Standby Router  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Virtual IP* refers to an IP address that maps to multiple physical devices, often used **in conjunction** with load balancing, but it's not the appliance itself.
- ❌ *Multipathing* is used for redundancy in **storage systems**, not load distribution for client-server traffic.
- ❌ *Hot Standby Router* is a **failover** router used in protocols like HSRP, not for traffic distribution.

🧱 Load balancers spread traffic across servers (nodes in a farm) to maximize performance and availability. Think of it like a traffic cop directing cars to the least congested road.

# QUESTION 7

What is an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet?

❌ A network of interconnected secure IoT devices  
✅ A botnet composed of compromised IoT devices  
❌ A botnet that exclusively targets financial institutions  
❌ A cybersecurity framework for IoT devices  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *A network of interconnected secure IoT devices* describes a standard IoT deployment, **not** a botnet.
- ❌ *A botnet that exclusively targets financial institutions* is too narrow—botnets can target **any** sector, not just finance.
- ❌ *A cybersecurity framework for IoT devices* is a **defense**, not an attack mechanism like a botnet.

🧱 IoT botnets form when attackers compromise insecure IoT devices (like cameras or smart plugs), then use them for attacks—especially DDoS (e.g., Mirai botnet).

# QUESTION 8

Which command is used to designate a switch as the primary root bridge in Spanning Tree Protocol?

✅ spanning-tree root primary  
❌ spanning-tree set root  
❌ spanning-tree primary root  
❌ spanning-tree root set primary  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *spanning-tree set root* – This is not a valid command in Cisco IOS syntax.
- ❌ *spanning-tree primary root* – Wrong order; STP commands are very particular.
- ❌ *spanning-tree root set primary* – Word salad. Not a valid Cisco command.

🧱 Cisco switches use:  
`spanning-tree vlan [vlan-id] root primary`  
to make a switch the primary root bridge for that VLAN.

---
# QUESTION 9

Which command would you use to add a static ARP entry for the IP address 192.168.1.100 with the MAC address 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E?

✅ ip neigh add 192.168.1.100 lladdr 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E nud permanent dev eth0  
❌ arp -a 192.168.1.100 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E  
❌ arp -s 192.168.1.100 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E  
❌ arp -d 192.168.1.100  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *arp -a* – This displays the ARP table. Doesn’t add or modify anything.
- ❌ *arp -s* – This used to work on older Linux distros, but `arp` is deprecated in favor of `ip` commands.  
  🔍 Might still work on some systems, but it’s not preferred or guaranteed.
- ❌ *arp -d* – Deletes an ARP entry. The opposite of what we want.

🧱 Modern Linux systems use `ip neigh add` for manipulating the neighbor/ARP table.

# QUESTION 10

What is the minimum subnet mask that can be used to accommodate at least 14 subnets?

✅ 255.255.240.0  
❌ 255.255.252.0  
❌ 255.255.248.0  
❌ 255.255.254.0  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *255.255.252.0 (*/22)* – Only gives you 4 subnets (2^2), not enough.
- ❌ *255.255.248.0 (*/21)* – 2^3 = 8 subnets. Still not enough.
- ❌ *255.255.254.0 (*/23)* – 2^1 = 2 subnets. Way too little.

🧱 You’re starting from a /16 (`10.0.0.0/16`). You need at least 14 subnets:
- Formula: `2^n ≥ 14` → n = 4 (because 2^4 = 16)
- So, /16 + 4 = **/20** → which is **255.255.240.0**

📐 TL;DR: You need to borrow 4 bits from the host portion to create 16 subnets → that’s a /20.

# QUESTION 11

What is the most likely cause of this issue?

✅ The DHCP server is offline or unreachable.  
❌ The network cable is unplugged from the clients.  
❌ The clients are set to use static IP addresses.  
❌ The DHCP server has been misconfigured.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Network cable unplugged* – If that were true, clients wouldn’t have *any* IP at all.
- ❌ *Static IP addresses* – Then you'd see manually configured IPs, *not* 169.254.x.x APIPA addresses.
- ❌ *Misconfigured DHCP* – Could be a cause, but a misconfigured server usually results in a NAK or wrong lease, not an APIPA fallback.

🧱 The 169.254.0.0/16 range is *APIPA* (Automatic Private IP Addressing), assigned when:
- The client *tries* to use DHCP
- But the server doesn’t respond
→ So it assigns itself a local-only IP (no Internet, no routing).

📌 Bottom line: No DHCP response = fallback to 169.254.x.x.

# QUESTION 12

Which of the following is NOT a mechanism used by distance vector protocols to prevent routing loops?

❌ Holddown timer  
✅ Flooding  
❌ Split horizon  
❌ Maximum hop count  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Holddown timer* – Temporarily suppresses updates about a route to avoid unstable information being propagated.
- ❌ *Split horizon* – Prevents a route learned on one interface from being advertised back out that same interface.
- ❌ *Maximum hop count* – Limits how far a route can spread; RIP uses 15 as unreachable to prevent infinite loops.

Why flooding is wrong here 🔍:
- ✅ *Flooding* is a **link-state** behavior (used in OSPF, IS-IS), not distance vector. Distance vector protocols **do not flood LSAs**, they use periodic updates and hop-by-hop vector propagation.

🧱 Distance vector loop prevention is all about:
- *Holddown*
- *Split horizon*
- *Route poisoning*
- *Max hop count*

Flooding? That’s someone else’s party.

# QUESTION 13

What is the primary purpose of a Multi-Source Agreement (MSA) in the context of modular transceivers?

❌ To decrease the cost of transceivers  
❌ To increase the data transmission speed of transceivers  
✅ To ensure compatibility between transceivers from different vendors  
❌ To standardize the size of transceivers  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *To decrease the cost of transceivers* – Cost *may* go down as a result of competition, but that’s not the MSA’s primary intent.
- ❌ *To increase the data transmission speed of transceivers* – Speed is determined by hardware capabilities and signal modulation, not the MSA.
- ❌ *To standardize the size of transceivers* – While MSAs often include size standards (like SFP, QSFP), the **core goal** is interoperability, not just physical form factor.

🧱 **MSA = handshake between vendors**  
Vendors agree on pinouts, electrical/optical specs, and mechanical dimensions so that transceivers can work across different equipment brands.

This gives network engineers the freedom to mix and match instead of being locked into one vendor's overpriced optics.

# QUESTION 14

What type of attack is MOST likely being attempted in this scenario, and what should be the IT manager's immediate response?

✅ A port scanning attack; the IT manager should implement or strengthen firewall rules to block unauthorized scans.  
❌ A phishing attack; the IT manager should train employees to recognize malicious emails and websites.  
❌ A denial of service (DoS) attack; the IT manager should increase the server's resources.  
❌ A spoofing attack; the IT manager should implement stronger authentication mechanisms.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Phishing attack* – Phishing targets **users**, not servers, and wouldn’t show up as repeated connection attempts to different ports.
- ❌ *DoS attack* – A DoS would overwhelm resources, not probe ports. No mention of service outages or resource exhaustion.
- ❌ *Spoofing attack* – Spoofing disguises identity or source IP. Here, it's the **volume and pattern** of traffic (port sweep) that matters.

🧱 **Port scanning = recon probe**
When an attacker hits a range of ports across one or more systems to identify what's open, it's recon — a precursor to a bigger attack.  
Firewall rule tightening or enabling an IDS/IPS would be the right move here.

# QUESTION 15

What service provides environmental control in the room?

❌ MTTR  
❌ PDU  
❌ UPS  
✅ HVAC  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)* – It's a **metric**, not a service or system. It tells you how long a device takes to recover after failure.
- ❌ *PDU (Power Distribution Unit)* – Delivers power to racks/devices, but doesn’t manage temperature or airflow.
- ❌ *UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)* – Keeps equipment running during a power outage but does not control temperature.

🧱 HVAC = **Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning**  
It’s the literal system that controls air temperature, humidity, and airflow — critical for keeping servers from overheating and failing. Without proper HVAC, uptime goes out the window.

# QUESTION 16

At Layer 4 of the OSI model, which mechanism is responsible for ensuring reliable data delivery between hosts?

❌ The use of port numbers to identify different types of network traffic  
❌ The encryption of data to prevent unauthorized access during transmission  
❌ The assignment of IP addresses to route packets to their destination  
✅ The implementation of flow control and error-checking protocols  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Port numbers* are part of Layer 4, but their **main function is traffic direction**, not reliability. Think of them as doors to specific applications, not the quality control.
- ❌ *Encryption* belongs to **Layer 6 (Presentation)** or **Layer 7 (Application)**, depending on the implementation. It secures data, but doesn't ensure it arrives correctly.
- ❌ *IP addressing* is a **Layer 3 (Network)** responsibility. It helps route packets to the right machine but doesn't guarantee they arrive intact or in order.

🧱 Layer 4 (Transport Layer) ensures reliability using:
- **TCP** with sequence numbers, acknowledgments
- **Flow control** (e.g., window size)
- **Error-checking** with checksums  
That's the layer that keeps the conversation between hosts clean and in the right order.

# QUESTION 17

What is the size of the addressing scheme used by IPv4?

✅ 32 bits  
❌ 64 bits  
❌ 128 bits  
❌ 256 bits  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *64 bits* is not used in IPv4. Some parts of IPv6 (like interface identifiers) may use 64-bit values, but not IPv4.
- ❌ *128 bits* is the size of **IPv6** addresses — the successor to IPv4.
- ❌ *256 bits* is too large and not used in current IP addressing schemes.

🧱 IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, typically written as:
`192.168.1.1`  
Each octet = 8 bits, so 4 octets × 8 = 32 bits.  
That gives a total of **2³² = ~4.3 billion** unique addresses (and yeah… we ran out).

# QUESTION 18

What is the first step in the DHCP lease process?

❌ DHCPACK  
✅ DHCPDISCOVER  
❌ DHCPOFFER  
❌ DHCPREQUEST  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *DHCPACK* is the final step. It's the server confirming the lease.
- ❌ *DHCPOFFER* comes **after** the client sends a DISCOVER. It’s the server’s response.
- ❌ *DHCPREQUEST* is the client choosing a specific offer and requesting to use it.

🧱 The correct order (DORA):
1. **D**HCPDISCOVER – client broadcasts looking for DHCP servers  
2. **O**FFER – server responds with an IP offer  
3. **R**EQUEST – client selects and requests that IP  
4. **A**CK – server acknowledges the lease

🔍 Remember: **DORA** = the dance between client and server.

# QUESTION 19

A Windows server manager is trying to calculate the amount of data loss that a system can sustain, measured in time units.  
What is this referred to as?

❌ WRT  
❌ MTD  
✅ RPO  
❌ RTO  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **WRT (Work Recovery Time)** is the time it takes to re-enter data lost during the outage — not the total tolerable data loss.
- ❌ **MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)** is the *total* amount of downtime a business can handle before irrecoverable damage.
- ❌ **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** is how quickly systems need to be restored — a *speed of recovery*, not *data loss tolerance*.

🧱 **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** = the point in time before a disaster to which data must be restored  
Example: RPO = 1 hour ➜ Backups must occur at least hourly, or risk >1 hour of lost data.

# QUESTION 20

Why is it important to label structured cables and patch cords at both ends?

❌ To ensure cables are aesthetically pleasing  
❌ To prevent electrical interference  
✅ To identify the circuit for troubleshooting unauthorized changes  
❌ To increase the speed of the network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Aesthetics**: Clean cable management looks nice, but labeling is about functionality, not fashion.
- ❌ **Electrical interference**: That's handled by cable shielding, spacing, and category—not labeling.
- ❌ **Speed increase**: Labels don’t change data rates; that's based on cable type and equipment specs.

🧱 Labeling helps trace circuits quickly during audits, troubleshooting, or reconfiguration.  
Think of it as tagging your keys so you don’t have to try them all when the server’s on fire (figuratively… hopefully).
