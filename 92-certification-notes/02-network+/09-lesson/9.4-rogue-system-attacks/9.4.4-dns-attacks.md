## 9.4.4 ‚Äì DNS Attacks

- DNS maps hostnames to IP addresses. Critical for network communication.
- Attackers target DNS to mislead users or reroute traffic.

### üß± DNS Spoofing vs. DNS Poisoning
- **Spoofing** = Fake replies or rogue DNS server.
- **Poisoning** = Tampering with cached DNS records.
- üîç Often confused, but technically different in method.

### ‚úÖ Common DNS Attack Types
- **Typosquatting**: Register similar domain names to trick users.
- **DRDoS**: DNS reflection to amplify DoS attacks.
- **Poisoned records**: Insert fake IPs into DNS server cache.

### üß± DNS-Based On-Path Attacks
- ARP poisoning + spoofed DNS replies.
- Can be paired with DoS against legit DNS server.
- Rogue DHCP assigns malicious DNS resolver.

### üß± DNS Client Cache Poisoning
- Modifies local `HOSTS` file to redirect traffic.
- File paths:
  - Linux/Unix: `/etc/hosts`
  - Windows: `%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`
- ‚úÖ Host file tampering = sign of compromise.

### üß± DNS Server Cache Poisoning
- Attack the DNS server itself via recursive queries.
- Insert fake domain:IP mappings into cache.
- Tools to verify:
  - `nslookup`
  - `dig`
