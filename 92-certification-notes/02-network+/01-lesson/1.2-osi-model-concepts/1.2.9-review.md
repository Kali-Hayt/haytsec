- ✅ The Session layer administers the process of establishing, managing, and terminating a dialog between client and server.  

**Explanation:** The **Session layer** sets up, manages, and tears down sessions between two communicating hosts. Think of it like a moderator making sure both sides take turns speaking in a conversation.

# **Question 9 of 15**

**Q:** A security engineer configures software-based port security on a hardware firewall.  
Which OSI model layer identifies the application ports to configure?

- ✅ Layer 4  
- ☐ Layer 3  
- ☐ Layer 2  
- ☐ Layer 1  

**Explanation:** Layer 4 (Transport Layer) is responsible for managing ports and ensuring proper end-to-end communication. It uses TCP/UDP port numbers to identify services like HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and FTP (21).

# **Question 10 of 15**

**Q:** What role does the Presentation layer (layer 6) of the OSI model play in terms of data compression and encryption?

- ☐ The Presentation layer is involved in the logical organization of data into frames for transmission.  
- ☐ The Presentation layer handles the routing of data between different networks and supports encryption protocols like IPsec.  
- ☐ The Presentation layer is primarily responsible for the physical encryption of data using hardware-based methods.  
- ✅ The Presentation layer supports data compression and encryption to prepare data for network transmission.

**Explanation:** The Presentation layer ensures that data is formatted, encrypted, and compressed in a way that the receiving system can interpret. It acts as the translator between application and network formats.

# **Question 11 of 15**

**Q:** What is the primary purpose of data encapsulation in network protocols?

- ☐ To compress data for faster transmission  
- ☐ To encrypt data for secure transmission  
- ✅ To add additional data headers for routing and delivery  
- ☐ To convert data into an analog signal for transmission  

**Explanation:** Encapsulation wraps data with necessary protocol information (headers, trailers) so it can be correctly routed, delivered, and understood across network layers.

# **Question 13 of 15**

**Q:** Match each OSI layer to its correct example or function.

- **Application layer** → HTTP  
- **Presentation layer** → Translates data  
- **Session layer** → Session ID number  
- **Transport layer** → Port number  
- **Network layer** → Router  
- **Data Link layer** → Switch  

**Explanation:**  
Each layer of the OSI model serves a specific role in the data communication process:

- **Application Layer (7):** Provides network services to end-user applications (e.g., HTTP).  
- **Presentation Layer (6):** Handles data formatting, encryption, and translation (e.g., ASCII ↔ Unicode).  
- **Session Layer (5):** Manages sessions and controls dialogs (e.g., session IDs).  
- **Transport Layer (4):** Provides end-to-end communication and port identification (e.g., port numbers).  
- **Network Layer (3):** Handles routing between networks (e.g., router functionality).  
- **Data Link Layer (2):** Manages node-to-node delivery and MAC addressing (e.g., switch).

# **Question 14 of 15**

**Q:** Which of the following functions are performed by the OSI Transport layer? (Select three.)

- ☐ Packet formatting for delivery through a medium  
- ☐ Consistent data formatting between dissimilar systems  
- ✅ Reliable message delivery  
- ✅ End-to-end flow control  
- ☐ Path identification and selection

- ☐ Media access control, logical topology, and device identification  

**Explanation:**  
The **Transport layer (Layer 4)** of the OSI model is responsible for:  
- **Reliable delivery** (e.g., TCP ensuring retransmission of lost packets)  
- **Flow control** (managing data rates to prevent overwhelming receivers)  
- **Segmentation and reassembly** (breaking down large data into segments and rebuilding them)  

Formatting and media access are handled at lower layers; data formatting across systems is a **Presentation layer** job.

# **Question 15 of 15**

**Q:** What is a Protocol Data Unit (PDU)?

- ☐ A measure of data transmission speed  
- ☐ A device that manages data transmission rates  
- ☐ A type of encryption used in data transmission  
- ✅ A chunk of data with protocol-specific headers added at each OSI layer  

**Explanation:**  
A **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)** is the formatted data passed between layers of the OSI model. Each layer adds its own **header (and sometimes a trailer)**, creating a chunk of data tailored for that layer. Examples:  
- Layer 2 = Frame  
- Layer 3 = Packet  
- Layer 4 = Segment  
PDUs are essential for communication between networking layers and devices.
