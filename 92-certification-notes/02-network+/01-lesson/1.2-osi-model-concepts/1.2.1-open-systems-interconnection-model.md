## 📘 Lesson 1.2.1 – Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

### 🌐 What is the OSI Model?
- Developed by **ISO** (The International Organization for Standardization) to promote understanding of how network components communicate.
- The OSI model is a **conceptual framework** that breaks down the network communication process into **7 distinct layers**.
- It separates hardware and software responsibilities so that each layer performs its own group of networking tasks.

### 🧱 OSI Layers (Top to Bottom)
1. **Application** – Interfaces with user applications (e.g., browsers, email clients)  
2. **Presentation** – Translates data formats, handles encryption & compression  
3. **Session** – Manages sessions and connection lifecycles between applications  
4. **Transport** – Provides reliable delivery via TCP/UDP, manages segmentation  
5. **Network** – Determines routing and logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses)  
6. **Data Link** – Manages MAC addressing and frame delivery within a local network  
7. **Physical** – Deals with actual transmission media (cables, switches, bits)

### 📌 Key Concept
> The OSI model is **not a strict standard or specification**, but a **guideline** for designing protocols, network software, and hardware, as well as for troubleshooting.
