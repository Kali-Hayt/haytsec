## 🧠 OSI Model: Upper Layers (Layers 5–7)

****

### **Layer 5 – Session*
- Responsible for managing and controlling the dialog between two computers.
- Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions (i.e. communication exchanges).
- Think: A Zoom call or SSH session – it begins, continues, and ends.

### **Layer 6 – Presentation**
- Translates data formats from application to network and vice versa.
- Handles data encryption, decryption, compression, and format conversions.
- Think: Translator – turns gibberish into meaningful text between apps and systems.

> 💡 *Example:* ASCII to EBCDIC, JPEG to raw bitmap, or encrypting/decrypting SSL/TLS.

### **Layer 7 – Application**
- Closest to the user; interface between user and the network.
- Provides protocols for email, file transfer, web browsing, directory services.
- Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP.


> 🔐 Summary:
> - Layer 5: Controls sessions and conversations.
> - Layer 6: Translates and secures data.
> - Layer 7: Gives users the tools (apps) to use the network.
