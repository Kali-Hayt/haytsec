## ðŸ”— Lesson 1.2.4 â€“ OSI Layer 2: Data Link

### ðŸ“˜ What Is the Data Link Layer?
- Responsible for **transferring data between nodes on the same logical segment**.
- Uses **hardware (MAC) addresses** to move frames between devices.
- Creates a **logical topology** â€” even if physical links differ.

---

### ðŸ§  Key Functions of the Data Link Layer
- **Forwarding** â€“ Nodes send data to one another through a central device (like a switch).
- **Addressing** â€“ Every network interface (NIC) has a unique **hardware address** (MAC).
- **Encapsulation** â€“ Converts data from Layer 3 into **frames**.
  - Adds a header with source & destination MAC addresses.
  - Adds a trailer with an **error-checking value** (FCS or CRC).
- **Framing** â€“ Frames are the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) at Layer 2.

---

### ðŸ–§ Example â€“ Frame Transmission with a Switch
1. Host **AA** wants to send data to Host **AC**.
2. The frame travels to the **switch**.
3. The switch looks at the **destination MAC address** and forwards the frame out the correct port.
4. Host **AC** receives and processes the frame.

### ðŸ§° Devices That Operate at Layer 2
- **NIC (Network Interface Card)** â€“ Sends and receives frames on a host.
- **Bridge** â€“ Joins two physical network segments.
- **Switch** â€“ Multiport bridge that forwards frames based on MAC addresses.
- **Wireless Access Point (AP)** â€“ Acts like a bridge between wireless and wired segments.

---

### ðŸ§  TL;DR Summary
- The Data Link Layer moves **frames** using **MAC addresses**.
- It defines local communication on the same segment (same subnet).
- Devices at this layer donâ€™t look at IPs â€” only local hardware addresses.
