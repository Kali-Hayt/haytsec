## 📨 Lesson 1.2.2 – Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation

### 📘 What Is a Network Protocol?
- A **network protocol** defines rules for sending/receiving data in a structured format.
- It performs two core functions:
  - **Addressing** – Identifies where data should go (each OSI layer uses its own method for node identification and communication rules).
  - **Encapsulation** – Packages data for transmission by adding a header at each layer (like stuffing a letter in an envelope).

### 🔁 Layer Communication Concepts
- **Same-layer interaction:** Protocols at the same OSI layer on two devices communicate (peer-to-peer protocol communication).
- **Adjacent-layer interaction:** Each layer relies on the layer below and provides service to the one above.

### 📦 Encapsulation (Sending Data)
> Each OSI layer adds a header to the data, creating a **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)**  
- App layer data ➝ HTTP header added  
- Transport layer ➝ TCP header (creates a TCP **segment**)  
- Network layer ➝ IP header (creates a **packet**)  
- Data Link layer ➝ Ethernet header & trailer (creates a **frame**)  
- Physical layer ➝ Converts frame to electrical/light signal (**bits**)

### 🧾 Example – Sending Process
1. **HTTP** generates application data  
2. **TCP** adds segment header  
3. **IP** adds packet header  
4. **Ethernet** adds frame header/trailer  
5. Frame is transmitted as bits over the wire by the **Physical layer**

### 🧯 Decapsulation (Receiving Data)
- Physical layer receives raw bits  
- Data Link layer decodes frame  
- Network layer extracts IP packet  
- Transport layer extracts TCP segment  
- Application layer extracts HTTP data for the app (browser, etc.)

> 💡 Think of encapsulation like **Russian nesting dolls**: each layer wraps the data in its own shell. Decapsulation is just unwrapping it layer-by-layer in reverse.

## 📨 Lesson 1.2.2 – Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation

### 🔄 What Is Data Encapsulation?
**Encapsulation** is the process of preparing data for network transmission by adding headers at each OSI layer.  
> Like mailing a letter — every OSI layer adds its own envelope with addressing and handling info.

Each layer wraps the data, turning it into a **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)**.

### 🧠 Step-by-Step – Sending Side

**Example: A web browser sends an HTTP request**

1. **Application Layer (7)** – Creates the data (e.g., an HTTP request).
2. **Transport Layer (4)** – Adds a TCP header (port numbers, sequence info) → now it's a **segment**.
3. **Network Layer (3)** – Adds an IP header (source/destination IPs) → now it's a **packet**.
4. **Data Link Layer (2)** – Adds MAC addressing → now it's a **frame**.
5. **Physical Layer (1)** – Converts the frame into **bits** (electrical/light/wireless signals).

### 🔓 Step-by-Step – Receiving Side

**The receiving host does the reverse:**

1. **Physical Layer** – Receives bits.
2. **Data Link Layer** – Reassembles the bits into a frame.
3. **Network Layer** – Extracts the IP packet.
4. **Transport Layer** – Reassembles segments.
5. **Application Layer** – Delivers the HTTP data to the browser or app.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

- Encapsulation provides **structure** to data transmission.
- Each device (router, switch, NIC) reads only the info it needs from its layer.
- Each OSI layer works independently, passing data up/down the stack without needing to know full context.

### 📦 Analogy – Shipping a Product

- **The product** = your original message  
- **Bubble wrap** = Transport layer  
- **Box with address label** = Network + Data Link layers  
- **Delivery truck** = Physical layer

> The recipient reverses the process — opens the box, unwraps the product, and gets the original data.
