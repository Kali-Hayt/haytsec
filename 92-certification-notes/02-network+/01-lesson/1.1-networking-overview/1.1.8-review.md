## ✅ Network Types & Topologies Quiz Review

**Question 1**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** A growing company has recently moved into a new office space. The company has 50 employees, each with their own workstation. The office also has multiple printers, a centralized server, and requires structured cabling for connectivity. Which type of network would be MOST effective for this setup?  
- ☐ Wide Area Network (WAN)  
- ☐ Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network  
- ✅ Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) network  
- ☐ Data Center  
**Explanation:** SME networks support dozens of users with structured cabling, switches, and routers. SOHO is too limited. WAN is for remote site connections. Data centers only host servers and storage.

**Question 2**  
**Q:** When referencing network topologies, what distinguishes half-duplex from full-duplex communication in a point-to-point link?  
- ☐ Half-duplex uses a single cable; full-duplex requires separate cables.  
- ✅ Half-duplex allows for data transmission in both directions, but not simultaneously; full-duplex permits simultaneous two-way data transmission.  
- ☐ Half-duplex can only occur in one direction; full-duplex allows data in both directions but not simultaneously.  
- ☐ Full-duplex is one direction at a time, but at higher speeds.  
**Explanation:** Half-duplex = two-way, one-at-a-time. Full-duplex = both directions at once. Number of cables isn’t the core issue.

**Question 3**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** You manage a network that's connected using a physical star topology. One of the drop cables connecting a workstation has been removed. What effect will this have?  
- ☐ No devices will be able to communicate.  
- ✅ All devices except the device connected with the drop cable will be able to communicate.  
- ☐ Devices on one side of the missing cable will talk; the other side won’t.  
**Explanation:** In a star, one disconnected device is isolated — others stay fully operational.

**Question 4**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following networking topologies connects each network device to a central forwarding appliance?  
- ✅ Star  
- ☐ Ring  
- ☐ Mesh  
- ☐ Bus  
**Explanation:** Star = all devices connect to a central switch/hub. Ring connects neighbors. Bus shares one cable. Mesh = multiple paths.

**Question 5**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** A team is configuring an IoT network using Zigbee. All devices are battery-powered and within 100 meters. Which topology BEST saves power and scales easily?  
- ☐ Bus  
- ☐ Star  
- ☐ Ring  
- ✅ Mesh  
**Explanation:** Mesh topology allows devices to relay for others, extending battery life and enabling massive scalability.

**Question 6**  
**Q:** You have a network using a full mesh topology. The link between Device A and B breaks. What happens?  
- ✅ Device A will be able to communicate with all other devices.  
- ☐ No devices will be able to communicate.  
- ☐ Device A can communicate with everyone except Device B.  
- ☐ Device A won’t be able to communicate at all.  
**Explanation:** Mesh topologies have redundancy. One broken link doesn't isolate a device.

**Question 7**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** You've implemented an ad hoc wireless network without a wireless access point. All wireless cards talk directly to one another. What topology is this?  
- ☐ Bus  
- ☐ Star  
- ✅ Mesh  
- ☐ Ring  
**Explanation:** Wireless mesh networks don’t need a central device. Every node can reach every other node directly.

**Question 8**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** You set up a network where each computer is both client and server. What network type is this?  
- ☐ Client-Server network  
- ☐ Enterprise network  
- ☐ Virtual Private Network  
- ✅ Peer-to-Peer network  
**Explanation:** In a P2P network, all hosts share responsibilities. This is decentralized, unlike a client-server model.

**Question 9**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** A multinational corporation needs to connect offices in New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney. What network type is MOST suitable?  
- ✅ Wide Area Network (WAN)  
- ☐ Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) network  
- ☐ Local Area Network (LAN)  
- ☐ Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network  
**Explanation:** WANs span long distances and interconnect global locations. LANs and SME networks are limited to one location.

**Question 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Your company network allows all devices to communicate as if directly connected, regardless of physical wiring. What topology is this?  
- ✅ Logical topology  
- ☐ Mesh topology  
- ☐ Ring topology  
- ☐ Star topology  
**Explanation:** Logical topology describes data flow. Physical connections might be star, but logical flow may be mesh-like.

**Question 11**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which networking term refers to nodes that send and receive data traffic?  
- ☐ Intermediate nodes  
- ✅ End systems  
- ☐ Network links  
- ☐ Network protocols  
**Explanation:** End systems (hosts) are where data originates and terminates. Intermediate nodes forward traffic only.
