## 🧠 **Networking Concepts – CertMaster Learn Network+ 9.0 (1.1.1)**

### 📡 What is a Network?

At its core, a **network** is:

Two or more computers linked by some kind of connection (wired or wireless) that **communicate** using shared protocols (rules for how data moves around).

**Think of it like a highway:**
- **Cars = data packets**
- **Roads = links (cables, Wi-Fi, etc.)**
- **Towns/cities = nodes (devices)**
    

---

### 🔗 Nodes and Links

- **Nodes** = devices that either:
    - Send/receive data (end systems / hosts)
    - Help forward traffic (intermediate nodes like routers/switches)
- **Links** = physical or wireless paths between those nodes
    

---

### 🖥️ End Systems vs. Intermediate Nodes

|**Type**|**Role**|**Examples**|
|---|---|---|
|End Systems (Hosts)|Send/receive data|PCs, smartphones, servers|
|Intermediate Nodes|Forward data|Routers, switches|

> ✅ Ethical hacking focuses _a lot_ on how to **exploit, protect, and analyze** both kinds — especially the vulnerabilities in end systems.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer

|**Client-Server**|**Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**|
|---|---|
|Centralized|Decentralized|
|Servers provide; clients consume|Hosts provide and consume services|
|Used in businesses|Common in homes or small workgroups|
|Easy to control + secure|Harder to manage|

**Example:**
- Your laptop is a **client** when visiting `Google.com`.
- A file-sharing network like BitTorrent? That’s **peer-to-peer**—you’re both uploading and downloading.

💡 In real life, systems often act as **both client and server** depending on the task.

### 🔧 Appliances, Applications, and Functions

#### 🔌 **Appliances** (Specialized network tools)

- **Physical** (e.g., firewall box) or **Virtual** (runs in a VM)
    
- Examples:
	- **Router** – Moves data between networks
    - **Switch** – Connects devices inside a network
    - **Firewall** – Blocks/permits traffic
    - **IDS/IPS** – Detects/prevents attacks
    - **Proxy** – Hides internal users; filters traffic
    - **Load Balancer** – Distributes workload across servers
        

> 🔐 As a future ethical hacker, you’ll need to understand how to **evade or penetrate** these appliances during pen tests — or how to **defend them** in blue team roles.

#### 🛠️ **Applications**

- The services the network actually runs, like:
    - File sharing
    - Email
    - DNS
    - Web servers
    
    These are what you’ll exploit/test in **web app hacking, email spoofing, DNS poisoning**, etc.

#### 🔁 **Functions**

- Added features built into network design:
	- **VPN** – Encrypts traffic across the internet
    - **QoS (Quality of Service)** – Prioritizes critical traffic (e.g., video calls)
        
🧠 Many of these will show up in tools you use like **OpenVPN, Wireshark, tcpdump,** or **Kali tools.**

### 🧠 Final Thought:

This module is basically saying:

> **"Here’s how networks are built — the pieces, the roles, and how they talk."**

You **need to** master this before you jump into **network-based attacks** like MITM (Man-In-The-Middle), port scanning, or exploiting DNS.
