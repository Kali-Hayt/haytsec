## **1.1.3 Network Topology**
- **Network Type** = scope  
- **Network Topology** = structure (how nodes + links are arranged)

### **🧱 Physical vs Logical Topology**
- **Physical Topology** – How nodes *physically connect* (cables, switches)
- **Logical Topology** – How data *flows* through the network

### **🔗 Point-to-Point (P2P)**
- **Definition**: 1:1 direct link between two nodes  
- **Bandwidth**: Shared only between the two = consistent throughput  
- **Can be**:  
  - *Physical* (like a crossover cable or fiber line)  
  - *Logical* (like a tunnel between two routers)

# Explanation:

## 🔄 **What Is Duplex?**
- Duplex defines **how data flows** between two network devices.
- It’s **not about the cables**, it’s about the **rules of communication** between devices.

## 🧠 **Three Key Terms from the Diagram**
1. **Point-to-Point (Duplex)** – Only 2 devices are talking (like a direct phone call). The cable connects just those 2 nodes.
2. **Half-Duplex** – Like a walkie-talkie. 🚫 Devices **can’t talk and listen at the same time**. One sends ➜ then waits for the reply. _Example: Ethernet hubs, older Wi-Fi._
3. **Full-Duplex** – Like a phone call. ✔️ Devices can **send and receive at the same time** — faster, more efficient. _Example: Ethernet switches with modern NICs._

## 🧱 **Physical vs Logical Topology (Quick Visual Analogy)**
| **Layer**   | **What it is**              | **Example**                              |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Physical   | Cables and actual layout    | Ethernet cable from PC to switch          |
| Logical    | How data flows logically    | Full-duplex or Half-duplex communication  |

- 🔌 **Physical** = Wiring & Ports  
- 🧠 **Logical** = Data Flow Rules
