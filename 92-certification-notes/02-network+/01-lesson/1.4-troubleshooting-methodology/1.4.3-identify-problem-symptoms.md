### 🧠 If user responses don't identify the problem, use additional techniques to diagnose the issue.

### 🔎 Identify Symptoms and Duplicate the Problem

Symptoms are **facts and clues** in the affected system that can be matched with known causes or issues.

**To identify symptoms, perform the following:**

- 🔍 Make a physical inspection; look for something out of the ordinary.
- 📋 Check system logs or use diagnostic software for information.
- 💻 Duplicate the problem on the user's system or a test system.
  - Try to follow the same steps the user took.
  - *Transient or hard-to-reproduce issues are the toughest to troubleshoot.*

### 🔄 Determine If Anything Has Changed

Ask these two key questions when trying to identify the problem’s cause:

- **Did it ever work?**
  - If yes → What changed around the time it stopped working?
  - If no → You're dealing with something that was *never* set up properly in the first place.

- **What has changed since it last worked?**
  - Physical movement (e.g., cables unplugged, hardware changes)
  - Environmental factors (e.g., cleaning staff tripping a cable)
  - Documented or undocumented configuration changes

Check:
- 🗃️ System inventory for documented changes
- 🔍 Local area for anything that may have changed physically

### 🔀 Approach Multiple Problems Individually

If a user reports several symptoms, **determine if they’re related**:

- 🧩 If unrelated → Treat as **separate** issues
- 🔗 If related → Look for a common root cause (e.g., missed update)

> 💡 Example: A PC loses internet **and** stops receiving updates  
> Might be the same issue — or coincidence.

**Best practice:**
- Open **separate tickets** for each issue unless strongly related.
- Advise the user to submit separate tickets when reporting multiple problems.
