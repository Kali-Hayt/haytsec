## 1.4.8 — Verify the Solution

---

### 🧪 Confirm It Works

After applying your solution:
- Validate that it **fixes the problem** reported by the user
- Ensure the **entire system still functions normally**
- Identify the **results and effects** of your solution

Ask yourself:
- Can the user perform the task now?  
- Can you **reproduce the issue** again? (hopefully not)

---

### ✅ Confirm with the User

Before you close the case:
1. Make sure **you** believe it’s fully resolved
2. Get the **customer’s confirmation** that it’s fixed
3. Restate the problem and how it was solved
4. Confirm that the incident log can now be **closed**

---

### 🔁 Prevent Recurrence

Part of verifying the fix is ensuring it doesn’t happen again.

Examples:
- If users keep plugging laptops into the wrong port — **label the jacks**
- If a single server outage causes major downtime — **add failover capability**

---

A fix isn’t complete until:
- It solves the issue
- It doesn’t break anything else
- It can’t (easily) happen again
