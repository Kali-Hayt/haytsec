**Question 1 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following statements correctly describes the wiring configuration for T568A termination?  
- ✅ The green pair is wired to pins 1 and 2.  
- ☐ The blue pair is wired to pins 3 and 6.  
- ☐ The orange pair is wired to pins 1 and 2.  
- ☐ The brown pair is wired to pins 3 and 6.  

**Explanation:**  
In the **T568A** standard:
- The **green pair** goes to **pins 1 and 2** (this is the key difference from T568B).
- The **orange pair** is shifted to pins 3 and 6.
- The **blue pair** is still on pins 4 and 5.
- The **brown pair** remains on pins 7 and 8.

You had it right from the beginning — T568A puts **green** on 1 and 2. That’s the whole twist in the A vs. B drama.

**Question 2 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which tool is used to create a patch cord by fixing a plug to a cable?  
- ✅ Cable crimper  
- ☐ Punch down tool  
- ☐ Wire stripper  
- ☐ Cable tester  
**Explanation:** A **cable crimper** secures an RJ45 (or other) connector onto the end of a twisted-pair cable, completing a patch cord. Punch down tools are used at patch panels, not for patch cords.

**Question 3 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following are the purposes of entrance facilities in a structured cabling scheme? (Select two.)

- ✅ To join the local exchange carrier (LEC)'s network and for inter-building communications  
- ☐ To house the building's wireless networking equipment exclusively  
- ☐ To act as a primary storage area for network documentation and manuals  
- ✅ To mark the point at which external cabling is joined to internal cabling  
- ☐ To serve as the main distribution frame (MDF) for the entire building  

**Explanation:**  
Entrance facilities serve as the **demarcation point** where external provider cabling meets the building's internal network. They also connect the building to **LECs and other buildings** for WAN or interconnect purposes.

**Question 4 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What type of terminals are found at the rear of a patch panel for cable termination?

- ✅ Insulation-displacement connection (IDC) terminals  
- ☐ USB ports  
- ☐ RJ-11 terminals  
- ☐ Coaxial cable connectors  

**Explanation:**  
IDC terminals are used on the back of patch panels to punch down twisted-pair cables. These make contact by slicing through the insulation — no need to strip wires manually. They’re a standard for structured cabling.

**Question 5 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** When installing structured cabling, why is it important to leave a service loop at both ends of the cable run?

- ☐ To make the installation look more professional and organized  
- ☐ To increase the tension on the cable, ensuring a tighter fit  
- ☐ To ensure that the cable can be easily pulled out for recycling  
- ✅ To provide extra cable length for future reconnections or changes  

**Explanation:**  
A service loop gives you slack — just enough extra cable to relocate, reterminate, or adjust without needing a full replacement. It’s a smart move for long-term maintenance and flexibility.

**Question 6 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What is used to connect a port on a patch panel to another network port, typically a switch port housed in the same rack?

- ☐ HDMI cable  
- ✅ RJ-45 patch cord  
- ☐ Power line  
- ☐ Fiber optic cable  

**Explanation:**  
An RJ-45 patch cord is the go-to cable for connecting patch panel ports to switch ports in the same rack. It’s short, flexible, and designed specifically for structured cabling environments like racks and wiring closets.

**Question 7 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** During a structured cable installation in an office renovation, you notice that the cable runs are in close proximity to several electrical power cables and fluorescent lights.

What is the MOST likely impact of this installation practice on the network's performance?

- ☐ Increased data transmission speed due to the warmth from the power cables  
- ☐ Enhanced cable aesthetics, making the installation more visually appealing  
- ☐ Improved cable flexibility and durability because of the proximity to light sources  
- ✅ Electromagnetic interference (EMI) causing potential degradation of data transmission  

**Explanation:**  
Cables placed too close to power lines or fluorescent lights are highly susceptible to EMI (Electromagnetic Interference). This doesn’t just cause poor signal quality — it can completely wreck network reliability. Always keep network cables isolated from electrical sources.

**Question 8 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which tool is used to terminate fixed cable by fixing conductors into an IDC?

- ☐ Wire stripper  
- ☐ Cable crimper  
- ✅ Punch down tool  
- ☐ Cable tester  

**Explanation:**  
A punch down tool is **specifically designed** to press wires into insulation-displacement connectors (IDC) — like those found on the back of patch panels and keystone jacks. It trims the wire and seats it in one strike, saving time and ensuring a secure connection. Critical tool in any structured cabling setup.

**Question 9 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What is a primary reason for an organization to choose one termination standard (T568A or T568B) over the other and stick with it?

- ☐ To ensure that all cables are the same color  
- ☐ To comply with international laws requiring the use of a single standard  
- ☐ To reduce the cost of Ethernet cables  
- ✅ To avoid compatibility and connectivity issues between devices  

**Explanation:**  
The main reason to stick with **one** termination standard (either T568A or T568B) is to avoid **mismatched wiring**, which can lead to signal issues and **crossover cables** when they’re not intended. Consistency ensures every connection is reliable across the network.

**Question 10 of 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What are the requirements for horizontal cabling in a structured cabling scheme? (Select two.)

- ✅ Must be within 90 m (295 feet) cabling distance of each wall port if using copper cabling.  
- ☐ Can only be installed in ceiling spaces, not wall ducts.  
- ✅ Must connect user work areas to an intermediate distribution frame (IDF).  
- ☐ Must be made of fiber optic cable exclusively.  
- ☐ Requires a wireless booster every 50 m to maintain signal strength.  

**Explanation:**  
Horizontal cabling runs from **telecommunications rooms (IDFs)** to **individual work areas**. The standard maximum distance for copper horizontal runs is **90 meters**, excluding patch cables. It doesn’t require fiber optics or wireless boosters and can be installed in various conduits or spaces.
