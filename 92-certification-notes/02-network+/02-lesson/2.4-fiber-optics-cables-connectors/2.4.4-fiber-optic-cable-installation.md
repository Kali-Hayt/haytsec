## üõ†Ô∏è 2.4.4 ‚Äî Fiber Optic Cable Installation

Fiber optic cables can be installed using the **same topology** as copper, involving **distribution frames**, **switches**, and **patch panels**. For long distances, fiber is laid out as **trunks** or **rings**, with **repeaters** or **amplifiers** used to boost signal strength between segments.

### üîÅ Duplex Fiber

- Installed in **pairs**.
- One strand transmits (**Tx**), the other receives (**Rx**).
- Essential for two-way communication.

---

## üîå Fiber Optic Patch Cords

- Can have the **same connector** on both ends (e.g., LC-LC) or **mixed types** (e.g., LC-SC).
- **Polarity matters** ‚Äî Tx on one end must connect to Rx on the other.
- Follow **TIA/EIA standard**:
  - Uses an **A to B polarity system**.
  - Requires an **odd number of elements** in the path (e.g., 2 patch cords + 1 permanent link).

> üîé Most connectors are **keyed** to prevent incorrect insertion.  
> üß™ Use an **optical power meter** to verify correct signal direction if unsure.

## üßº Finishing Type

The **ferrule** (connector tip) can be finished in different ways to affect signal clarity and physical connection.

- **UPC (Ultra Physical Contact)**:
  - Flat or slightly curved polished tip.
  - Good connection with low signal loss.

- **APC (Angled Physical Contact)**:
  - Angled tip for **tighter fit**.
  - Reduces back-reflection even more.
  - **Not compatible** with UPC/PC connectors.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Match finishing types with the equipment being used ‚Äî some devices won‚Äôt support APC.

## üé® Color Coding Reference

| Type        | Jacket Color | Connector Color |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| OM1         | Orange       | Beige           |
| OM2         | Orange       | Black           |
| OM3/OM4     | Aqua         | Aqua            |
| SMF PC/UPC  | Yellow       | Blue            |
| SMF APC     | Yellow       | Green           |

These visual indicators help technicians identify the cable type and avoid cross-mode mismatches during installation.
