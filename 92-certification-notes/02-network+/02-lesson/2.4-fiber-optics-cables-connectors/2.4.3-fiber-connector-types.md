## ðŸ§© 2.4.3 â€” Fiber Optic Connector Types

Fiber optic connectors come in various form factors. Some are optimized for **multimode**, others for **single mode**, and some support both.

### ðŸ”Œ Straight Tip (ST)
- **Type**: Bayonet-style connector with a twist-and-lock design.
- **Use case**: Early multimode networks.
- **Status**: Mostly obsolete in modern Ethernet deployments.
