## üì¶ 2.5.1 Rack Systems

- **Secure Equipment Areas**: Network gear belongs in secured spaces like:
  - Telecommunications closets
  - Equipment/server rooms
  - Datacenters (for provisioning, not general storage)

- **Physical Access**: Only authorized personnel should have entry.

- **Racks**:
  - Steel shelving systems for standard-size gear.
  - Optimizes space = **density** (more hardware, less footprint).
  - Uses **EIA 19" (48.26 cm)** standard width.

- **Mounting**:
  - Appliances screwed directly to rack.
  - Nonstandard gear (tower servers, monitors) = use shelves.

- **Rack Height (U units)**:
  - 1U = **1.75" / 4.45 cm**
  - Rack sizes range from **8U to 48U**
  - Devices are labeled with U-size so you can plan space.

- **Rack Types**:
  - **Freestanding** (can bolt together in rows)
  - **Wall-mounted** (smaller installations)

- **Airflow & Layout**:
  - Leave **3 feet (1 meter)** clearance for aisles.
  - Back-to-back layout preferred for cooling:
    - Known as **hot aisle / cold aisle**

- **Cooling Design**:
  - Front = intake fans (cool air in)
  - Back = exhaust fans (hot air out)
  - Some switches: **port-side exhaust** or **port-side intake** for cable convenience

- _**Hot aisle / cold aisle**_ prevents mixing of intake/exhaust airflow.

- **Airflow Enhancements**:
  - Use **side panels** and **blanking plates**
  - Lockable doors (front/rear) protect physical access

## üå°Ô∏è 2.5.2 Humidity and Temperature

- **Environmental Controls**:
  - Prevent downtime due to overheating or hardware failure.
  - Managed by **HVAC** (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning).

- **Sensors Used**:
  - Measure temperature and humidity
  - Detect internal issues inside the chassis:
    - Overheating
    - Fan failures
    - Chassis intrusion

### üîç Monitoring Key Factors

- **Temperature**:
  - High temps = cooling struggles = overheating risk
  - Devices must dissipate heat effectively

- **Humidity**:
  - Too high = condensation ‚Üí short circuits, corrosion
  - Too low = static buildup ‚Üí component damage

- **Electrical**:
  - Must be stable!
  - Watch for:
    - Power failures
    - Surges/spikes
    - Voltage drops
  - UPS and battery backup systems monitor power anomalies

- **Flooding**:
  - Natural or plumbing-related water threats
  - Shut down systems immediately if water is detected
