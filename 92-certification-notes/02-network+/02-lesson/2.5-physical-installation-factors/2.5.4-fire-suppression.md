## 2.5.4 Fire Suppression

### 🔍 Fire Safety Elements
- ✅ Well-marked fire exits
- ✅ Emergency evacuation procedures (tested and practiced)
- ✅ Fire-resistant walls and doors to slow fire spread
- ✅ Automatic smoke/fire detection systems and manual alarms

### 🔥 Fire Suppression Systems
- Operate on the **fire triangle**: Heat + Oxygen + Fuel = Fire
- Removing any one element suppresses the fire

### 🔥 Fire Classifications (NFPA System - USA)
- **Class A**: Combustible materials (wood, paper, cloth, plastics)
- **Class C**: Electrical fires (require gas-based extinguishers to avoid shock)

### 🚿 Sprinkler Systems
- **Wet-pipe**: Constant water pressure, auto-activates with heat
  - ❌ Risk: burst pipes, accidental triggering, water damage
- **Dry-pipe**: For areas prone to freezing, fills with water only on trigger
- **Pre-action**: Combines dry + detection. Water only enters after alarm is triggered
  - Prevents accidental discharge

### 💨 Gas-Based Fire Suppression
- **Halon**: Effective, leaves no residue, but banned for ozone depletion
- **Clean agent**: Modern Halon alternative (non-toxic, non-damaging)
  - 🧪 Examples:
    - INERGEN (CO₂ + Argon + Nitrogen)
    - FM-200 / HFC-227
    - FE-13
  - Reduces oxygen concentration & cools area
  - ✅ Safe for people (unlike pure CO₂)
