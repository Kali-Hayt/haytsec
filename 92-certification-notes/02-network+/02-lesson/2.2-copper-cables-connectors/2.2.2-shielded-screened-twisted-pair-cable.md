## 🛡️ 2.2.2 Shielded and Screened Twisted Pair Cable

### 🧵 Overview:
Shielded twisted pair (STP) cable is designed to reduce **interference** and **crosstalk**, making it ideal for environments with:

- High levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI)
- Proximity to motors, fluorescent lights, or generators
- Stricter Ethernet standard requirements

---

### 🧰 Types of Shielding:

#### 1. **Screened Twisted Pair (ScTP / F/UTP / FTP)**
- Has one **thin foil shield** around **all pairs**
- May be called:
  - **Screened twisted pair (ScTP)**
  - **Foiled/unshielded twisted pair (F/UTP)**
  - **Foiled twisted pair (FTP)**

#### 2. **Fully Shielded (S/FTP)**
- **Braided outer screen** + **foil shield on each pair**
- Called **shielded/foiled twisted pair (S/FTP)**
- Variant: **F/FTP** = Foil around each pair + foil outer shield

#### 3. **U/FTP**
- **Foil shielding on each pair**
- No **overall outer shield**

---
### ⚙️ Installation Complexity:

- **Legacy STP**:
  - Required manual **bonding** (grounding) of each shielded element
  - Complex to install

- **Modern STP (F/UTP, S/FTP)**:
  - Easier to implement
  - Cables, connectors, patch panels include **built-in bonding**

---

> **Tip:** Use shielded cable when running near high interference sources or when required by Ethernet standards.
