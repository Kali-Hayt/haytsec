### Cable Category Issues

When troubleshooting a permanent link, you should verify that the cable type is appropriate to the application.  
For example, you cannot expect **10 GbE Ethernet** to run over an **80 m Cat 5e** link.  
You may also need to verify that **unshielded cable** has not been installed where **shielded or screened cable** would be more suitable.  

> ⚠️ Using an incorrect cable type might result in:
> - Lower-than-expected speed
> - Numerous checksum errors
> - Link resets

Check the **identifier printed on the cable jacket** to verify the type that has been used.

### Evaluating Cable Category Suitability

When evaluating whether a cable category is suitable for a given use in the network, consider the following:

- **Cat 5e**  
  - Supports **Gigabit Ethernet**
  - Still acceptable for workstation links
  - **New installations now use Cat 6 or better**

> 🔍 Unlike Ethernet and Fast Ethernet, **Gigabit Ethernet uses all four pairs** for transmission  
> → More sensitive to **crosstalk between wire pairs**

---

- **Cat 6**
  - Supports **10 Gbps**, but only up to **55 meters**

- **Cat 6A**
  - Supports **10 Gbps over 100 meters**
  - Bulkier and stricter to install than Cat 5e
  - Older cable pathways may have issues
  - TIA/EIA recommends Cat 6A for:
    - Healthcare facilities
    - PoE 802.3bt installations
    - Horizontal connections to WAPs

> 🔍 Connectors, patch panels, and wall plates must also match the Cat 6A rating  
> → Performance drops if connectors are rated lower than the cable

---

- **Cat 7**
  - Always shielded/screened
  - Rated for **10 Gbps up to 100 m (328 ft)**
  - **Not TIA/EIA recognized** — but included in **ISO/IEC 11801**
  - Must use **GG45 or TERA** connectors (not standard RJ45)

- **Cat 8**
  - Intended for **datacenters only**
  - For **short patch cable runs** (top-of-rack)
  - ISO defines two classes:
    - **8.1 (Class I)** → uses RJ45 (equivalent to TIA/EIA Cat 8)
    - **8.2 (Class II)** → must use **outer shielding** and **GG45 or TERA**

---

### Safety Consideration

From a safety standpoint, ensure the **cable jacket type** is suitable for the installation environment:

- Use **plenum-rated cable** in plenum spaces
- Use **riser-rated cable** in riser spaces
