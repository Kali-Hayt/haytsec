## 2.6.1 - Specification and Limitations

When troubleshooting a link, you must compare expected vs actual performance. This requires understanding how to assess and distinguish:

- Speed
- Throughput
- Bit rate
- Baud rate
- Latency
- Attenuation
- Interference

---

## Speed vs Throughput

### ðŸ”¹ Baud Rate
- **Baud Rate** = Number of signal symbols (changes) per second.
- Measured in **Hz** (hertz), **MHz**, or **GHz**.
- Related to the **physical layer**.
- Each symbol could represent a bit or more depending on encoding.

### ðŸ”¹ Bit Rate
- **Bit Rate** = Number of bits per second (bps).
- Measures bandwidth (nominal capacity).
- Found at **Data Link layer**.
- Bit rate can exceed baud rate if encoding packs more than one bit per symbol.

Example:
> If 1 symbol = 2 bits, bit rate is higher than baud rate.

---

## Throughput

- Actual data transfer achieved over time (real performance).
- Affected by:
  - Encoding schemes
  - Errors
  - Link distance
  - Interference

- Measured in:
  - **Packets per second**
  - **Application layer transfer rate** ("goodput")

ðŸ§± Throughput < Bit Rate  
(Because real-world conditions reduce capacity)

---

## Latency

- Time delay in delivery of packets.
- Measured in **milliseconds (ms)**.
- AKA "delay"
- Not the same as "speed" or "bit rate".

ðŸ’¡ The term **"speed"** is misleading â€” people use it for latency or throughput, but they're **not the same**.

---

## Distance Limitations, Attenuation, and Interference

### ðŸ”¹ Attenuation
- Signal loss over distance.
- Measured in **decibels (dB)**.
- dB = ratio of signal strength at origin vs. destination.

### ðŸ”¹ Interference
- Noise that disrupts signal transmission.
- Makes it harder to distinguish valid signals.
- Causes:
  - Data errors
  - Retransmissions
- Expressed as **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**.

ðŸ§± Both attenuation and interference **limit usable cable distance**.
