### Cable Testers

If the cable is not accessible, cable testing tools can also be used to diagnose intermittent connectivity or poor performance issues. A cable tester reports detailed information on the physical and electrical properties of the cable. 

For example, it can test and report on:
- Cable conditions
- Crosstalk
- Attenuation
- Noise
- Resistance
- Other characteristics of a cable run

Devices classed as certifiers can be used to test and certify cable installations to a performance category — for example, that a network is TIA/EIA 568 Category 6A compliant. They use defined transport performance specifications to ensure an installation exceeds the required performance characteristics for parameters such as attenuation and crosstalk.

> 🔍 Cable testing tools can be used for troubleshooting and verification.  
> It is best to verify wiring installation and termination just after all connections are made.  
> You should still have access to the cable runs at this point.  
> Identifying and correcting errors is much simpler now than when setting up end-user devices.
