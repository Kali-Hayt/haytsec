## üß™ Network+ Lab 2.6.14 - Troubleshoot Physical Connectivity 3

### üß≠ Scenario

You‚Äôre a network technician for a small corporate network. Moments ago, the building suffered a **power blackout**. Power has been partially restored, but some offices and networking closets are still down.  
Employees in the **Executive Office** and the **Support Office** report that they can't access the Internet or other computers on the network.  
You must diagnose and fix the issue as it relates to **network connectivity**.

### üñ•Ô∏è IP Address Reference Table

| Location           | Computer Name | IP Address     |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Networking Closet  | CorpServer    | 192.168.0.10   |
| Office 1           | Office1       | 192.168.0.30   |
| Office 2           | Office2       | 192.168.0.31   |
| Support Office     | Support       | 192.168.0.32   |
| IT Administration  | ITAdmin       | 192.168.0.33   |
| Executive Office   | Exec          | 192.168.0.34   |
| Lobby              | Gst-Lap       | 192.168.0.35   |

### üîß Task List

- Use these **troubleshooting tools** to diagnose the network issue:
  - `ping` command to test reachability
  - Network activity lights on NICs and switches
  - **Network and Internet Status** in Windows 11 or Server 2019

- Use **known good spares** (e.g., cables, NICs) if needed.
- Confirm the issue is resolved using the same tools.

---

### üß† Troubleshooting Strategy

1. **Step 1: Identify Symptoms**
   - Executive and Support Office computers cannot access other systems.
   - Power outage may have affected switches, cabling, or DHCP services.

2. **Step 2: Ping Test from a Working PC (e.g., ITAdmin)**
   - Try: `ping 192.168.0.32` (Support)
   - Try: `ping 192.168.0.34` (Exec)
   - 100% loss = either:
     - System is offline
     - No network power
     - Bad switch/cable/NIC

3. **Step 3: Physical Inspection**
   - Check LEDs on the NIC and switch for Support & Exec PCs
   - If no lights:
     - Confirm power to wall outlets and switch
     - Replace cable or move to spare switch

4. **Step 4: IP Configuration Check**
   - Log in locally (if possible) and run `ipconfig`
   - Watch for:
     - APIPA (169.254.x.x) = no DHCP
     - Incorrect subnet or missing gateway

5. **Step 5: Replace Hardware if Needed**
   - Swap power adapter, cable, switch, or NIC using shelf spares

6. **Step 6: Confirm Resolution**
   - `ping` both Exec and Support from CorpServer and ITAdmin
   - Confirm Internet and intranet access is restored

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- `ping` to 192.168.0.32 and 192.168.0.34 succeeds
- Link lights are active and blinking on NICs
- `ipconfig` shows correct IP/subnet/gateway
- Users can access the Internet and internal systems

### üóíÔ∏è Reflection

This lab focused on **power-related physical layer failures**, introducing real-world network fragility when switches lose power. Key takeaways:
- Always confirm power status on both **end devices and networking hardware**
- APIPA addresses and no link lights = physical issues
- Power recovery often brings **partial connectivity**‚Äîverify **every leg** of the network path

It also reinforces a real-world lesson: when in doubt, **check the power first.**
