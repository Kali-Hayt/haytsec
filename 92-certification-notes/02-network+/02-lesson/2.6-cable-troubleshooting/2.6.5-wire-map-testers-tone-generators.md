### Wire Map Testers and Tone Generators

A basic wire map tester is a cheaper alternative to full-featured cable certifiers.  
It detects improper terminations in network cables.

To run a wire map test:
- Connect the base unit to one end of the cable.
- Connect the remote unit to the other end.
- Run the test — each wire conductor should light an LED **in sequence**.

If a wire fails to light (or lights out of sequence), it means there's a wiring problem.

### ❌ Common Wiring Faults Detected by Wire Map Testers

- **Continuity (Open)**  
  Conductor doesn't complete a circuit — possibly damaged or miswired connector.

- **Short**  
  Two wires are joined where they shouldn't be. Caused by insulation damage or bad wiring.

- **Incorrect Pin-Out / Termination / Mismatched Standards**  
  Wires are punched down in the wrong order at one or both ends.

- **Reversed Pair**  
  Wires in a pair are swapped (e.g., pin 3 → pin 6, pin 6 → pin 3).

- **Crossed Pair (TX/RX Transposed)**  
  Transmit and receive pairs are flipped — may be intentional for crossover cables.

### 🔍 Advanced Fault: Split Pair

- Wires from **two different pairs** are connected to the same pair of terminals.
- Cannot be detected by continuity test — only by testers that detect **crosstalk**.

### 📣 Tone Generator and Probe

Also called a **Fox and Hound**:
- The tone generator sends a signal down a cable.
- The probe "listens" for the tone and helps trace the cable in a bundle or conduit.
- Used when cables aren't labeled and need to be identified manually.
