**Question 1**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** A network administrator notices that the data transfer rates between devices in a 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet network are not reaching the expected 100 Mbps. The network uses switches, and all devices support Fast Ethernet.  
What could the network administrator enable to improve the data transfer rates to the expected 100 Mbps?
- ☐ Replace all Cat 5 cables with fiber optic cables  
- ✅ Full-duplex mode on all devices  
- ☐ Replace switches with hubs  
- ☐ Autonegotiation on all devices  
**Explanation:** Enabling full-duplex mode allows devices to send and receive data simultaneously without collisions, effectively doubling the potential throughput and making full use of 100BASE-TX. This is especially effective when using switches instead of hubs.

**Question 2**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** Which of the following correctly describes the components of the convention used in naming Ethernet media specifications? (Select three.)
- ☐ The color coding of the cabling.
- ☐ The type of error correction used.
- ✅ The signal mode (baseband or broadband).
- ☐ The maximum allowable distance between devices.
- ☐ The maximum number of connections supported.
- ✅ The speed or bit rate in megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps).
- ✅ A designator for the media type.
**Explanation:** Ethernet media specifications like 100BASE-TX include three main components: the speed (100 Mbps), the signal type (BASE for baseband), and the media type (TX for twisted pair). These define how data is transmitted and over what medium.

**Question 3**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** What feature should the IT manager ensure the new network devices support to maintain compatibility with older devices?

- ☐ Use of hubs instead of switches  
- ✅ Autonegotiation  
- ☐ Full-duplex transmissions  
- ☐ Higher frequency signaling  
**Explanation:** Autonegotiation allows network devices to automatically adjust to the highest speed and duplex mode supported by both devices, ensuring backward compatibility with 10 Mbps legacy hardware.

**Question 4**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** What type of transmission is available with the contention-based MAC system utilized by Ethernet?

- ☐ Full-duplex transmission  
- ☐ Simplex transmission  
- ☐ Multiplex transmission  
- ✅ Half-duplex transmission  
**Explanation:** Traditional Ethernet using a contention-based MAC (like CSMA/CD) only supports **half-duplex transmission**, meaning data can flow in one direction at a time, not simultaneously in both directions.

**Question 5**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** What should the IT team prioritize to ensure the successful integration of the new workstations into the existing 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet network in the MOST effective way?

- ✅ Replace all existing hubs with switches to reduce collisions.
- ☐ Extend the fiber optic backbone to each new workstation.
- ☐ Implement autonegotiation on all network devices.
- ☐ Use fiber optic cables for all new horizontal links.

**Explanation:** Hubs operate at layer 1 and create one large collision domain, which can significantly slow down network performance. Replacing them with switches (layer 2 devices) improves performance by segmenting the collision domains and enabling full-duplex communication where supported.

**Question 6**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** For what reason might a company deploy 10/40 GbE Ethernet in its network?

- ☐ To meet the standard for all new installations  
- ☐ To avoid using fiber optic cable  
- ✅ To support very high bandwidth data transfers  
- ☐ To reduce overall network costs  

**Explanation:** 10/40 GbE (Gigabit Ethernet) is used to support extremely high bandwidth demands such as data center traffic, video streaming, or large-scale virtualization environments. It's not about lowering cost—it's about delivering speed.

**Question 7**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** What is the main advantage of using fiber optic cable over copper cable?

- ☐ Easier to splice  
- ✅ Higher bandwidth  
- ☐ More durable  
- ☐ Lower cost  

**Explanation:** Fiber optic cables offer significantly higher bandwidth and can carry data over longer distances without loss compared to copper. While they can be more fragile and costly, the speed is unmatched.

---
**Question 8**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** In a contention-based MAC system, such as that used by Ethernet, what are the consequences of adding more nodes to the network? (Select two.)

- ☐ All devices on the network receive an automatic speed upgrade.  
- ✅ The effective data rate is reduced.  
- ☐ The network automatically switches to a token ring MAC system.  
- ☐ The network becomes immune to eavesdropping.  
- ✅ Collisions become more frequent.  

**Explanation:** In a contention-based system, more nodes mean more competition for the medium. This increases the likelihood of collisions and reduces the overall effective throughput.

**Question 9**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** Which of the following best describes 10BASE-T network cabling?

- ✅ Works at 10 Mbps (10), uses a baseband signal (BASE), and runs over twisted pair copper cabling  
- ☐ Operates at 100 Mbps (100), uses broadband signal transmission (BROAD), and utilizes fiber optic cabling  
- ☐ Functions at 1 Gbps (1000), employs baseband signal transmission (BASE), and is implemented with coaxial cabling  
- ☐ Delivers a speed of 10 Gbps (10G), uses a broadband signal (BROAD), and relies on wireless transmission  

**Explanation:** The "10BASE-T" standard refers to Ethernet that runs at 10 Mbps, uses baseband signaling, and transmits over twisted pair cabling. It's part of the original IEEE 802.3 standard.

**Question 10**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** Network data transfer works by modulating the properties of a transmission medium to encode a signal.  
Which of the following BEST describes that process?

- ✅ The transmission of signals as electric current, infrared light, or radio waves  
- ☐ The process of converting digital signals into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines  
- ☐ The physical infrastructure, such as cables and switches, used to transmit data in a network  
- ☐ A method of securing network data by encrypting the information before transmission  

**Explanation:** Network data transfer involves sending modulated signals—whether electrical, optical, or electromagnetic—across a medium. This modulation encodes data for communication between devices.
