### ✅ Completed Tasks

- Q1: What is the IP address of the ISP?
  - ✅ **198.28.2.254**

- Q2: How many hops did it take to access the ISP?
  - ✅ **4**

- Q3: What is the name of the device accessed on the third hop?
  - ✅ **CorpNet pfSense**

- ✅ Fix the subnet mask on Exec
- ✅ Enable the scope on the DHCP Server
- ✅ Fix the 003 Router option on the DHCP Server
- ✅ Configure Exec for DHCP

## 🧱 Key Fixes and Learnings

### 🔹 Exec Troubleshooting:
- Initially failed to ping CorpServer due to:
  - ❌ Wrong subnet mask (`255.255.255.240`)
  - ❌ Static IP assignment with no DHCP
  - ❌ Default gateway mismatch (`192.168.0.4` instead of `.5`)
- **Fixes applied:**
  - Updated subnet to `255.255.255.0`
  - Updated gateway to `192.168.0.5`
  - Converted Exec to **DHCP-enabled**
- ✅ Result: Ping to ISP worked after subnet & gateway corrected.

---

### 🔹 Office1 Troubleshooting:
- Had APIPA address (`169.254.x.x`) meaning:
  - DHCP client enabled but ❌ **no response from DHCP server**
- DHCP scope was **inactive** on CorpDHCP.
- **Fixes applied:**
  - Activated the DHCP scope
  - Changed the DHCP router option from `.2` to correct `.5`
- After `ipconfig /renew`:
  - ✅ Got proper IP, Gateway, DNS
  - ✅ Could ping CorpServer and ISP

---

## 🔍 Final Configuration Notes

- Office machines rely on **CorpDHCP**
- Exec machine **temporarily** used static settings for troubleshooting
- Once DHCP was fixed and router option corrected, Exec was switched back to **automatic IP via DHCP**

---

## ✅ Final Network Status
- All machines:
  - On the same subnet (`255.255.255.0`)
  - Use `192.168.0.5` as default gateway
  - Use DHCP properly
- Connection to **ISP (198.28.2.254)** verified via ping and tracert
- No more IP scope exhaustion or misconfig

---

## 💡 Core Concepts Reinforced

- APIPA (169.254.x.x) = DHCP failure fallback
- Matching subnet masks = crucial for communication
- Scope must be active + correct router option
- Static IP is useful for testing, but DHCP is preferred for normal ops
