## 6.4.2 – DHCP Issues  
#cloud-plus #networking-plus #dchp

### 🧱 Overview

When a DHCP client (like a Windows host) fails to get an IP lease, it falls back to:
- **APIPA**: Automatic Private IP Addressing (169.254.0.0/16) on Windows
- **Link-local or unconfigured state** on Linux (e.g., 0.0.0.0 or nothing)

This fallback breaks access to most network services.

### 🔍 Common Reasons for DHCP Lease Failures

- **DHCP Server is Offline**  
  - Clients won’t get new leases.
  - Existing users may slowly drop off as leases expire.
  - Network becomes fragmented and unreliable.

- **DHCP Scope Exhaustion (no more IPs)**  
  - Fix: Increase scope size, reduce lease time.
  - Shorter leases help in environments with high churn (e.g., guest Wi-Fi).
  - Use **IPAM** (IP Address Management) to monitor and manage address usage efficiently.

- **Router Doesn’t Support BOOTP/DHCP Forwarding**  
  - DHCP Discover is a broadcast — won’t cross subnets without a helper.
  - Fix: Use **RFC 1542-compliant** routers or install a **DHCP relay agent** on each subnet/VLAN.

### 🛠️ Admin Considerations When Reconfiguring DHCP

- Scope changes won’t auto-update existing clients.
- Clients might retain:
  - Expired IP
  - Outdated gateway
  - Old DNS server
- Mitigation strategies:
  - Lower lease duration before rollout.
  - Force client renewals.
  - Run overlapping DHCP scopes during transition.

### ⚠️ Security Note

> Also be aware that **address pool exhaustion** might signal a **malicious attack** (e.g., DHCP starvation).
