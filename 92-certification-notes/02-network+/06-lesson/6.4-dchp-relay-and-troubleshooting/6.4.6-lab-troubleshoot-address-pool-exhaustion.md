## 6.4.6 – Troubleshoot Address Pool Exhaustion  
#lab  #networking-plus #labs #dhcp #troubleshooting

### 🧠 Scenario Overview

You investigated a DHCP issue in the marketing department where one computer failed to receive an IP address. The lab simulated a full DHCP scope that caused one client to fall back to APIPA.

---

### 🧪 Environment Setup

- **DHCP Server**: 192.168.0.14
- **Original Scope Range**:  
  `Start IP`: 192.168.0.1  
  `End IP`: 192.168.0.42
- **Clients**: Marketing1–Marketing7

---

### 🛠 Observations

- Machines **Marketing1–Marketing6**:
  - ✅ Received valid IPs from DHCP
  - ✅ DHCP Enabled
- Machine **Marketing7**:
  - ❌ Assigned APIPA (`169.254.x.x`)
  - ✅ DHCP Enabled, but no lease
- Scope ending IP **192.168.0.42** was assigned to one of the 6 working clients

---

### 🔍 Root Cause

- DHCP scope was **exhausted** (only 42 IPs in pool)
- No free addresses available for Marketing7
- Autoconfiguration (APIPA) triggered due to no DHCP response

---

### 🧯 Solution Applied

- **Expanded the scope**:  
  `End IP` updated from `192.168.0.42` → `192.168.0.254`
- **Ran**:  
  ```powershell
  ipconfig /renew
