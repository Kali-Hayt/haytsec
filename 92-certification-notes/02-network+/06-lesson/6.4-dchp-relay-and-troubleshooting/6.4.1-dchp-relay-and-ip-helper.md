## 6.4.1 â€“ DHCP Relay and IP Helper  
#networking-plus #lesson #dhcp #ip-helper  

### ðŸ§± Why DHCP Relay Is Needed
- **Routers do not forward broadcast traffic** by default.  
- DHCP requests are **broadcasts**, so without intervention, they won't leave the local subnet.
- Normally, each subnet would need **its own DHCP server**, which doesn't scale well.

### âœ… DHCP Relay Agent (RFC 1542 Compliant)
- **Intercepts** broadcast DHCP Discover frames.
- **Encapsulates and unicasts** the message to the configured DHCP server.
- Adds info about the **originating subnet**, so the server knows the right IP scope to assign.
- Reverses the process to get the response back to the original client.

### ðŸ§± IP Helper Address
- Configured on **router interfaces** to forward DHCP broadcast traffic to a remote DHCP server.
- Forwards **specific UDP broadcast types**, including DHCP, by default.
- Acts as a software equivalent to DHCP relay.

#### Example Cisco IOS config:
```bash
interface eth1
 ip helper-address 10.1.0.200

interface eth2
 ip helper-address 10.1.0.200
