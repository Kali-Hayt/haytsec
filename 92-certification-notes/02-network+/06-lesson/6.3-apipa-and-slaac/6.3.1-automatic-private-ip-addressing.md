## 6.3.1 – Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)  

---

### ✅ What is APIPA?

**Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)** is a fallback IP assignment method used **when a host can’t reach a DHCP server**. It was developed by Microsoft to allow basic local communication even if DHCP fails.

- Used **only if no DHCP response is received**
- Assigns an address from the **169.254.1.1 to 169.254.254.254** range  
- This range comes from the **169.254.0.0/16** block  
- First and last subnets in the range are **reserved/unusable**  
- Standard defined in **RFC 3927**

🧱 Think of it like:  
> "If no one gives me an address, I’ll make up one I can use just for the neighborhood."

### 🧱 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. Host sends out DHCP discovery → no reply  
2. After timeout, host assigns itself a **random 169.254.x.x** address  
3. Runs an ARP check to avoid duplicate address conflicts  
4. Can now talk to other devices **on the same subnet also using APIPA**

### 🔍 APIPA Limitations

- ❌ No **default gateway** (no internet access)  
- ❌ No **DNS server** assignment  
- ✅ **Local-only communication**  
- Usually seen in small or temporary networks (e.g., two PCs directly connected via Ethernet)

### 🧪 Example Scenario

- Two laptops are plugged into each other via Ethernet  
- No DHCP server is present  
- Both self-assign 169.254.x.x addresses  
- They can now share files or ping each other—**but cannot reach the internet**

### 📝 Exam Tip

> If you see a **169.254.x.x address**, it's a red flag that **DHCP failed** and the system is using **APIPA** as a fallback.
