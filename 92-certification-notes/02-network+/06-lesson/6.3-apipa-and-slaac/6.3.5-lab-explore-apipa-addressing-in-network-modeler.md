## 🧱 Network Behavior Summary  

- **Before DHCP:**  
  - Both PCs had APIPA addresses (169.254.x.x)  
  - Local ping successful ✅  

- **After Home-PC1 got DHCP (192.168.1.x):**  
  - Ping to Home-PC2 (still APIPA) failed ❌  
  - Different networks  

- **After both got DHCP:**  
  - Both now on 192.168.1.x network  
  - Ping worked again ✅

## 📍 Key Concepts  

- APIPA = Local link-only (169.254.0.0/16)  
- DHCP assigns usable private IPs (e.g., 192.168.x.x)  
- Devices must share the same network to communicate without a router  
- Gateway = router IP, critical for routing beyond subnet
