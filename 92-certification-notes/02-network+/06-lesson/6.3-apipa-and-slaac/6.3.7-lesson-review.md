# QUESTION 1
Which IPv6 autoconfiguration method allows a host to generate a link-local address and verify its uniqueness?

- ✅ SLAAC  
- ❌ DHCPv6  
- ❌ ARP  
- ❌ Manual configuration  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ DHCPv6 provides IPv6 addresses from a DHCP server, not self-generated link-local ones.
- ❌ ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used in IPv4, not IPv6 — IPv6 uses NDP instead.
- ❌ Manual configuration requires a user or admin to assign the address, not autoconfigure it.

# QUESTION 2
Which Neighbor Discovery Protocol function enables a router to inform a host of a better route to a particular destination in an IPv6 network?

- ❌ Address autoconfiguration  
- ❌ Prefix discovery  
- ❌ Local address resolution  
- ✅ Redirection  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Address autoconfiguration is how a host assigns itself an address, not how routers suggest better paths.
- ❌ Prefix discovery is used for identifying network/subnet boundaries, not for route optimization.
- ❌ Local address resolution is used to find link-layer addresses (like ARP in IPv4), not routing paths.

# QUESTION 3
What is the primary role of a DHCPv6 server in an IPv6 network?

❌ To locate the default gateway for clients  
❌ To generate host addresses with suitable network prefixes  
✅ To provide additional option settings  
❌ To support broadcast messages for IPv6 clients  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ The **default gateway** is handled by **Router Advertisements (RAs)** in the SLAAC process, not DHCPv6.
- ❌ Host addresses with **network prefixes** are generated by **SLAAC**, not the DHCPv6 server.
- ❌ IPv6 doesn’t use broadcast — it relies on **multicast**, especially for things like DHCPv6 server discovery.

# QUESTION 4
What happens if a Windows host does not receive a response from a DHCP server within a given time frame?

✅ It will select an address at random from the APIPA range.  
❌ It will shut down to prevent network conflicts.  
❌ It will prompt the user to manually enter an IP address.  
❌ It will broadcast a request for manual configuration assistance.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Windows won’t shut down due to DHCP failure; that would be absurd for user productivity.
- ❌ No prompt appears asking the user to manually input an IP unless configured for static.
- ❌ There’s no such “broadcast for help” mechanism — Windows just falls back to APIPA silently.

# QUESTION 5
What is the role of Router Advertisements (RAs) in the IPv6 address configuration process?

✅ To inform hosts of network prefixes and autoconfiguration options  
❌ To encrypt data packets sent between hosts and routers  
❌ To request an IP address from a DHCPv6 server  
❌ To assign static IP addresses to devices  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ RAs don’t encrypt packets — that’s a job for IPsec or TLS, not basic router functions.
- ❌ Hosts don’t use RAs to *request* DHCPv6 addresses — RAs inform, DHCPv6 responds separately.
- ❌ Static addresses are configured manually, not handed out via RAs. RAs support *autoconfiguration*, not static assignment.
