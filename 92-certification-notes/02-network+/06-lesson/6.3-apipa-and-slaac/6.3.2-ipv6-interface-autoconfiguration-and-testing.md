## 6.3.2 – IPv6 Interface Autoconfiguration and Testing  

---

### ✅ Key Concept: IPv6 Requires a Link-Local Address

- Every IPv6 interface **must always have a link-local address**
- Additional **routable IPv6 addresses** can be assigned:
  - Either statically (common for routers/servers)
  - Or using **autoconfiguration**, e.g., SLAAC  

🧱 Think of the link-local as your "device’s local-only passport"—it’s always present, even if you never leave the LAN.

### 🌐 SLAAC – Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

SLAAC = IPv6's way of giving a device an address **without DHCP**.

1. Host **generates a link-local address**
2. Sends **NS (Neighbor Solicitation)** to check uniqueness
3. Listens for **RA (Router Advertisement)** or sends **RS (Router Solicitation)**
4. Router responds with:
   - A **prefix** to use for a global address
   - Or points to a **DHCPv6 server** for additional info
   - Or both (mixed stateless + stateful config)

📦 SLAAC gives hosts a routable address with **no need for DHCP** – lightweight, scalable, and more flexible than IPv4's APIPA.

### 📡 ND – Neighbor Discovery Protocol

IPv6 replaces ARP + DHCP functions with **ND Protocol**, which handles:

- **Address autoconfiguration** – with NS (Neighbor Solicitation) & NA (Advertisement)
- **Prefix discovery** – finds valid prefixes via **Router Advertisements (RA)**
- **Local address resolution** – maps L2/L3 addresses like ARP
- **Redirection** – router points host to a better route

👥 ND = “Who else is out there?” and “Where should I send this?”

---

### 📬 RA and RS (Router Advertisement / Solicitation)

- **RS (Router Solicitation):** Host says “Who’s the router?”
- **RA (Router Advertisement):** Router replies with prefix info, MTU, hop limits, and whether DHCP is needed

📡 Routers send RAs **periodically** and **in response to RS** requests.

### 💣 ICMPv6 – The Backbone of IPv6 Messaging

IPv6 uses an enhanced **ICMPv6** for control messaging:

- **Error messaging:** Destination unreachable, Time Exceeded, and new **"Packet Too Big"** errors
- **Informational messaging:** Echo, Redirect, **ND messages (RA, RS, NA, NS)**, and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery)

❌ Under IPv6, routers don’t fragment packets—**hosts must handle MTU limits**, hence "Packet Too Big."

---

### 📝 Exam Tip

> If a host has an IPv6 address but there's **no DHCP**, it likely used **SLAAC + RA** to auto-configure.  
> Always remember that **link-local is mandatory**—you’ll never see an IPv6 device without one.
