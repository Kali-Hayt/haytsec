## 6.1.4 – User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

### ✅ Overview

- UDP also operates at the **Transport layer (Layer 4)** but is **connectionless**.
- **No acknowledgments**, **no flow control**, and **no retransmission** of lost packets.
- Ideal for applications that:
  - Don’t require guaranteed delivery.
  - Can tolerate occasional packet loss.
  - Need speed over reliability.

> 🔍 If reliability is needed, it must be handled by the **Application layer** (not UDP itself).

### ⚡ UDP vs TCP (Speed vs Reliability)

- **UDP** is faster because:
  - Fewer headers (only 8 bytes).
  - No handshakes or state tracking.
- Used for:
  - **Voice, video, streaming**
  - **DNS, DHCP, SNMP**
  - **Multicast & broadcast traffic**

### 🧱 UDP Header Fields

| Field            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Source port**       | UDP port of the sending host. |
| **Destination port**  | UDP port of the destination host. |
| **Message length**    | Total length of the UDP packet. |
| **Checksum**          | Validates packet integrity. |

> 🧠 Note: UDP’s 8-byte header is far smaller than TCP’s 20+ byte header.

### 🧠 Key Traits

- **No sequence numbers**, so **no guaranteed order**.
- **No retransmissions** or delivery confirmation.
- **No session setup or teardown.**
- Perfect when **low latency** is more important than perfection.
