## 6.1.5 – Using netstat

### 🔍 netstat Overview
- **`netstat`** is a CLI tool used to display network connections, routing tables, interface stats, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
- Used heavily in **troubleshooting** and **network monitoring**.
- Available on Windows, Linux, and macOS (with some syntax differences).

### 📌 Common netstat Switches

| Command               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `netstat`             | Shows active connections |
| `netstat -a`          | Shows all connections and listening ports |
| `netstat -n`          | Shows addresses/ports as numbers (no DNS resolution) |
| `netstat -o`          | Displays **process ID (PID)** associated with connections |
| `netstat -b`          | Shows the executable behind each connection (Windows only; needs admin) |
| `netstat -r`          | Displays routing table |
| `netstat -s`          | Shows per-protocol stats |
| `netstat -anob`       | Combined view: all connections, numeric format, PIDs, and binaries (Windows) |

> 🧠 Use `netstat -ano` on Windows to see connection state, local/remote IPs, and PID — then match with Task Manager.

### 🧠 Key Use Cases

- Check **which ports are open/listening** on the local system.
- Identify **suspicious connections** (e.g., malware callbacks).
- Confirm if a **specific service or app** is bound to a port.
- See which **remote IPs** a system is connected to.
- Troubleshoot **duplicate bindings** or port conflicts.

---

### ⚠ Limitations

- `netstat` is **deprecated on some modern systems**.
- For more advanced use, consider:
  - `ss` (on Linux) — faster and more capable
  - `Get-NetTCPConnection` (on PowerShell)
