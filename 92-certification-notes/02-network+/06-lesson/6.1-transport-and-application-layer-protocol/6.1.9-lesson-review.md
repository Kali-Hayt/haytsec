# QUESTION 1

**Which statement BEST describes the use of port numbers in TCP/IP networking?**

❌ Port numbers are used exclusively for encrypting network communications.  
✅ Port numbers are used in conjunction with IP addresses to direct packets to specific services or applications.  
❌ Port numbers are optional and rarely used in modern networking.  
❌ Port numbers are used to identify the physical location of devices on a network.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Port numbers have nothing to do with encryption. That’s handled by protocols like TLS.
- ❌ Port numbers are **required**, not optional—they’re central to TCP/UDP communication.
- ❌ Port numbers **do not** identify physical location; that’s more about MAC addresses or topology mapping.

# QUESTION 2

Which TCP flag is used by both the client and server to indicate that they want to close the connection?

❌ ACK  
✅ FIN  
❌ SYN  
❌ RST  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **ACK**: Used to acknowledge received packets, but not to close a connection.
- ✅ **FIN**: Proper way to start closing a TCP connection. One side sends a FIN, the other replies with ACK, then sends its own FIN.
- ❌ **SYN**: Used to initiate a connection, not close it.
- ❌ **RST**: Abruptly resets a connection, usually due to an error or rejection—not a proper close.

# QUESTION 3

UDP is particularly suitable for which type of applications?

❌ Applications that send large amounts of data in each packet  
✅ Applications that send small amounts of data and do not require acknowledgment  
❌ Applications that require guaranteed delivery  
❌ Applications that require extensive error checking and correction  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Large amounts of data**: That’s TCP’s job—UDP has a small header and no built-in mechanisms for segmentation and reassembly.
- ✅ **Small amounts, no ACK**: Perfect for UDP—lightweight, fast, no connection setup, no guarantees.
- ❌ **Guaranteed delivery**: UDP doesn’t promise delivery—that’s what TCP’s handshake and retransmissions are for.
- ❌ **Extensive error checking**: UDP has basic checksums, but no correction or retransmission; it’s “send and forget.”

# QUESTION 4

Which `netstat` switch is used to filter sockets by IPv4 or IPv6 addresses on Linux?

❌ -n  
❌ -a  
❌ -p  
✅ -4 or -6  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **-n**: Displays numerical addresses and ports (no DNS resolution), but doesn’t filter by IP version.
- ❌ **-a**: Shows all connections (listening and non-listening), not specific to IP version.
- ❌ **-p**: Shows the process using the socket, again not related to IPv4/IPv6.
- ✅ **-4 or -6**: Filters output specifically for IPv4 or IPv6 sockets, respectively.
---
# QUESTION 5

How is a connection uniquely identified in a TCP/IP network?

❌ By the MAC addresses of the communicating devices  
✅ By the combination of server port and IP address and client port and IP address  
❌ By the server port and IP address only  
❌ By the client port and IP address only  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **MAC addresses** are used at Layer 2 (Data Link), not to identify TCP connections. They don’t appear in TCP headers.
- ❌ **Server port + IP** alone is not enough—multiple clients can connect to the same server.
- ❌ **Client port + IP** also isn’t unique—same issue in reverse.
- ✅ A TCP connection is defined by a **4-tuple**: client IP + client port + server IP + server port.

# QUESTION 6

What does TCP use to divide data from the Application layer?

❌ Frames  
✅ Segments  
❌ Packets  
❌ Bits  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Frames** are Layer 2 (Data Link) units, not used by TCP.
- ✅ **Segments** are the correct term at Layer 4 (Transport), where TCP operates.
- ❌ **Packets** are Layer 3 (Network) data units, handled by IP.
- ❌ **Bits** are the lowest-level physical layer units—not used for TCP division.
---
# QUESTION 7

What might cause a host to send a reset (RST) segment during a TCP session?

❌ The host receives an ACK for an unexpected segment.  
❌ The host receives a segment out of order.  
✅ The host decides to abruptly end the session.  
❌ The host wishes to establish a new TCP connection.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Unexpected ACK** may cause retransmission, but not necessarily an RST.
- ❌ **Out-of-order segments** are handled by buffering and reordering—not by reset.
- ✅ **RST** is sent when a host wants to kill the connection *immediately*, like slamming the phone.
- ❌ **New connections** start with a SYN flag, not a reset.

---
# QUESTION 8

Your computer is sharing information with a remote computer using the TCP/IP protocol. Suddenly, the connection stops working and appears to hang.

Which command can you use to check the state of ports on your computer?

❌ **ping**  
❌ **ipconfig**  
❌ **arp**  
✅ **netstat**

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **ping** checks if a host is reachable, not port states.
- ❌ **ipconfig** shows IP config details, not active port usage.
- ❌ **arp** maps IPs to MACs on the local network—not useful for checking port states.
- ✅ **netstat** shows active connections, listening ports, and protocol use—perfect for diagnosing hung TCP sessions.

# QUESTION 9

A network administrator is looking at packet captures from the network and trying to isolate email traffic.  
Which of the following should the network administrator include? (Select two.)

✅ TCP 25  
✅ TCP 143  
❌ UDP 161  
❌ TCP 123  

Why the others are wrong:
- ✅ **TCP 25** is used by SMTP (sending email).
- ✅ **TCP 143** is used by IMAP (reading email from server).
- ❌ **UDP 161** is for SNMP (monitoring devices), not email.
- ❌ **TCP 123** is NTP (time sync), not related to email.

---
# QUESTION 10

Which protocols and port numbers are used by DHCP? (Select two.)

✅ UDP 67  
✅ UDP 68  
❌ TCP 69  
❌ TCP 123  
❌ UDP 123  
❌ UDP 69  

Why the others are wrong:
- ✅ **UDP 67** is used by DHCP servers to send responses.
- ✅ **UDP 68** is used by DHCP clients to receive configurations.
- ❌ **TCP/UDP 69** is TFTP, not DHCP.
- ❌ **TCP/UDP 123** is for NTP (time sync).

# QUESTION 11

You've recently installed a new Windows server. To ensure system time accuracy, you've loaded an application that synchronizes the hardware clock on the server with an external time source on the Internet. Now you must configure your network firewall to allow time synchronization traffic through.

Which of the following ports are you MOST likely to open on the firewall?

❌ 110  
❌ 119  
❌ 80  
✅ 123  

Why the others are wrong:
- ✅ **123** is used by **NTP (Network Time Protocol)** — the standard protocol for time sync.
- ❌ **110** is for **POP3** email.
- ❌ **119** is for **NNTP** (Network News Transfer Protocol).
- ❌ **80** is for **HTTP** (web traffic), unrelated to time services.

---
# QUESTION 12

Which TCP flag is set by the client to initiate the three-way handshake?

❌ FIN  
❌ ACK  
❌ RST  
✅ SYN  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **FIN** is used to **gracefully close** a connection, not start one.
- ❌ **ACK** is used to **acknowledge** received segments during the connection, not to initiate.
- ❌ **RST** is used to **reset** a connection due to errors or abrupt terminations.

---
# QUESTION 13

Which command would you use to show listening and established Internet connections (TCP and UDP) only?

❌ netstat -o  
✅ netstat -tua  
❌ netstat -s  
❌ netstat -e  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **netstat -o** shows process IDs (PIDs) associated with connections, but doesn’t filter by TCP/UDP.
- ❌ **netstat -s** displays protocol statistics, not actual connection states.
- ❌ **netstat -e** shows Ethernet stats like bytes sent/received, not Internet connections.

---
# QUESTION 14

What layer of the OSI model does the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) operate at?

❌ Application Layer  
❌ Data Link Layer  
✅ Transport Layer  
❌ Network Layer  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Application Layer** is for user-facing protocols like HTTP, FTP—not TCP.
- ❌ **Data Link Layer** handles MAC addressing and framing (think switches), not transport.
- ❌ **Network Layer** is where IP operates, not TCP.

---
# QUESTION 15

What is the purpose of a socket in the context of network communications?

✅ To serve as a unique identifier for a network connection  
❌ To provide a physical connection between two devices  
❌ To encrypt data being sent over the network  
❌ To act as a firewall between the client and server  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Physical connection** refers to cabling or wireless signals, not logical sockets.
- ❌ **Encryption** is handled by protocols like TLS, not by sockets.
- ❌ **Firewall** is a security system; sockets don’t provide traffic filtering or control.
