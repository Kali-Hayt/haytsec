## 6.6.1 ‚Äì Client DNS Issues
#networking-plus

A DNS issue is often revealed when a system can **ping a server by IP address** but **not by name**.

### üß± How DNS Resolution Works
- When a host doesn‚Äôt know the IP for a name, it asks its **configured DNS resolver** (usually the one from DHCP).
- Most clients are set with **primary and secondary DNS servers**.
- These are often autoconfigured using **DHCP**.
- If DNS fails, name resolution fails‚Äîeven if IP communication works.

---

### üîç Single Client Can't Resolve Names
- Likely a **client misconfiguration**.
- On **Windows**: use `ipconfig /all` to verify DNS settings.
- On **Linux**: check `/etc/resolv.conf`.
  - Often managed by tools like **NetworkManager** or **systemd-networkd**.
  - Manual edits here can be overwritten on reboot.
  
Fixes:
- Ensure correct DNS servers are listed.
- If statically configured, double-check entries.
- If DHCP-assigned, investigate DHCP scope settings.

### üîç All Clients Have DNS Issues
- Indicates a **problem on the server**, not individual clients.
- Possible causes:
  - DNS server is offline.
  - Server isn‚Äôt reachable from client subnet.
  - DHCP might be misconfiguring DNS addresses.
- Fixes:
  - Ping the DNS server from a client.
  - Check DHCP scope options for DNS settings.
  - Ensure DNS service is running on server.

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Notes
- **LLMNR** and **mDNS**: fallback methods for name resolution in local networks.
  - These don‚Äôt use traditional DNS servers.
  - Used in **Windows workgroups** and some **IoT/local discovery** setups.

- **Browsers and apps** may use different DNS settings than the system itself.

### üß† Analogy
Think of DNS as the "phone book."  
- IP address is the phone number.  
- DNS gives you the number when you only know the name.  
- If the phone book is missing or wrong, you can still dial the number‚Äîbut you won‚Äôt know who it belongs to.
