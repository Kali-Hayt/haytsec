## 6.5.12 Lab: Create Standard DNS Zones

### 🧱 Goal
Simulate name resolution for a payroll system server by:
- Creating a **primary forward lookup zone** on `CorpDC`.
- Creating a **secondary forward lookup zone** on `CorpDC3` to replicate the zone.

---

### ✅ Tasks Completed

#### On `CorpDC` (Primary DNS Server)
- Created a **Primary Zone** named `acct.CorpNet.local`.
- ⛔ **Did NOT store in Active Directory** (unchecked box).
- 📄 Used default zone file name: `acct.CorpNet.local.dns`.
- ❌ **Disabled dynamic updates**.
- 🔁 **Enabled zone transfers**:
  - Allowed transfers **to any server**.

#### On `CorpDC3` (Secondary DNS Server)
- Created a **Secondary Zone** named `acct.CorpNet.local`.
- 🧭 Master DNS server: `192.168.0.11` (`CorpDC.CorpNet.local`).
- ✅ Zone validated and synced with primary.

---

### 💡 Concepts Reinforced

- **Primary Zone** = authoritative, editable source of DNS data.
- **Secondary Zone** = read-only replica, improves fault tolerance & load balancing.
- **Zone Transfer** = syncs zone data from primary to secondary DNS.
- **Do NOT store in Active Directory** when creating standard (file-based) zones.
- **High Availability** in DNS = using secondary zones for redundancy.
- **Name Resolution Acceleration** = secondary zone improves lookup speed for remote locations (e.g., Building B).

---

### 🧠 Real-World Application

> In a real company (like a bank or enterprise):
> - **CorpDC** would be the authoritative DNS server in HQ.
> - **CorpDC3** might be in a branch office or data center, helping users resolve names without hitting HQ every time.
> - This setup supports **fast, redundant, and resilient name resolution**.

---

### 🏁 Result

- ✅ Score: **100%**
- ⏱️ Time Spent: `~6 min`
- 🧠 Memory Muscle: ✅ built
