## 6.5.2 DNS Hierarchy

### 🧱 What is the DNS?
- The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a global, hierarchical, distributed database.
- It maps **host names** and **domain names** to IP addresses.
- Makes the internet human-readable (like phonebook for IPs).

### ✅ DNS Structure
- The hierarchy goes **from root down**:
  - **Root (.)** → TLD (.com, .net, .uk) → Domain → Subdomain → Hostname
- Represented as most **specific on the left**, most **general on the right**.

Example FQDN:

pc.corp.515support.com.

- `pc` = hostname
- `corp` = subdomain
- `515support` = domain
- `com` = TLD
- `.` = root

### 🧱 DNS Root
- Top of the hierarchy: just a dot `.`
- There are **13 root DNS servers** (named A to M).
- They contain info on all top-level domains (TLDs).

### ✅ Top-Level Domains (TLDs)
- Managed by ICANN (📎 [icann.org](https://icann.org))
- Types:
  - **Generic TLDs**: `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.info`, `.biz`
  - **Sponsored TLDs**: `.gov`, `.edu`
  - **Country-code TLDs (ccTLDs)**: `.uk`, `.ca`, `.de`

### 🧱 DNS Resolution Path
1. **Root DNS servers** know where to find each TLD.
2. **TLD servers** know where to find the domain's name servers.
3. **Domain’s name servers** know where to find the subdomain or host.

📍 **No single server knows everything**. Each DNS server just knows where to go next.

### 🔍 Resource Records
- Resource records are the actual **host-to-IP mappings**.
- These sit at the **bottom** of the DNS tree, where specific devices are referenced.
- Example:
  - `www.515web.net` = web server record
  - `pc.corp.515support.com` = PC record

### 🧠 Analogy
DNS is like a **tree of directories**:
- Root = master index
- TLDs = filing cabinets
- Domains = folders
- Hosts = files inside the folders
