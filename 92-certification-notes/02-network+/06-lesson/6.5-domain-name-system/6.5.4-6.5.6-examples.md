## 6.5.4 â€“ Resource Record Types ðŸ§±

DNS zones contain **resource records (RRs)** that help DNS servers resolve hostnames into IP addresses and provide other data like service info, email routing, and more.

### âœ… Start of Authority (SOA)
- Defines the **authoritative DNS server** for the zone.
- Includes:
  - **Primary name server**
  - **Admin contact** (email format: `hostmaster.example.com.`)
  - **Serial number** for versioning
  - **Refresh, retry, expire, TTL** values

```
@ IN SOA ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
   2025072901 ; serial
   3600       ; refresh
   1800       ; retry
   604800     ; expire
   86400      ; TTL
)
```

---

### âœ… Name Server (NS)
- Specifies **which DNS servers** are authoritative for the zone.
- A zone typically has one primary and one or more secondary NS records.

```
example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com.
example.com. IN NS ns2.example.com.
```

---

## 6.5.5 â€“ Host Address and Canonical Name Records ðŸ§±

### âœ… A Record (Address Record)
- Maps a hostname to an **IPv4 address**.

```
www.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.10
```

---

### âœ… AAAA Record
- Maps a hostname to an **IPv6 address**.

```
ipv6.example.com. IN AAAA 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334
```

---

### âœ… CNAME Record (Canonical Name)
- Sets an **alias** for another hostname.
- Must **not** be used at zone apex (root).
- Helps simplify DNS management.

```
blog.example.com. IN CNAME www.example.com.
```

---

## 6.5.6 â€“ Mail Exchange, Service, and Text Records ðŸ§±

### âœ… MX Record (Mail Exchange)
- Directs **email** to mail servers.
- Uses **preference numbers** (lower = higher priority).
- Each mail server must have an A/AAAA record.

```
example.com. IN MX 10 mail1.example.com.
example.com. IN MX 20 mail2.example.com.
```

---

### âœ… SRV Record (Service Location)
- Maps a **service** (e.g., VoIP, LDAP) to its location.
- Format:
  ```
  _service._proto.name. IN SRV priority weight port target.
  ```

```
_ldap._tcp.example.com. IN SRV 0 5 389 dc1.example.com.
```

Used in:
- Microsoft Active Directory
- VoIP (SIP, XMPP)
- Auto-discovery services

---

### âœ… TXT Record (Text)
- Stores **human-readable text** or configuration for other systems.
- Used for:
  - **SPF** â€“ Anti-spam
  - **DKIM** â€“ Email signing
  - **DMARC** â€“ Email validation policies

#### Example: SPF
```
example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 -all"
```

#### Example: DKIM
```
default._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0..."
```

## âœ… Summary Table

| Record | Example | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| SOA | `ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com.` | Zone authority and metadata |
| NS | `example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com.` | Points to DNS servers |
| A | `www.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.10` | IPv4 mapping |
| AAAA | `ipv6.example.com. IN AAAA ...` | IPv6 mapping |
| CNAME | `blog.example.com. IN CNAME www.example.com.` | Alias to another host |
| MX | `example.com. IN MX 10 mail1.example.com.` | Email routing |
| SRV | `_ldap._tcp.example.com. IN SRV 0 5 389 dc1.example.com.` | Service discovery |
| TXT | `example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 ip4:... -all"` | SPF, DKIM, metadata |

ðŸ§  **Note**: DNS records are often static, but DDNS (Dynamic DNS) allows hosts to update records automaticallyâ€”especially common with DHCP clients on enterprise networks.
