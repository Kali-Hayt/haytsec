## 6.5.4 Resource Record Types  
#networking-plus  

### üß± DNS Zones and Records  
- A **DNS name server** organizes its namespace into **zones**.  
  - A zone may contain **multiple domains**.  
  - Subdomains can be split into separate zones or hosted across different servers.

- Each zone contains **resource records** (RRs):  
  - Used to map **hostnames to IPs** or define DNS behaviors.  
  - Records can be manually added (static) or dynamically generated.

### ‚úÖ SOA (Start of Authority)  
- **Identifies the primary name server** for the zone.  
- Contains:  
  - Serial number: versioning control for the zone.  
  - Primary name server (authoritative DNS).  
  - Contact info for admin (often in the format of an email using a dot `.` instead of `@`).  
  - Refresh/retry/expire intervals for zone replication.  
  - TTL (Time To Live): how long records are valid in cache.  

üß† **Analogy**: SOA = master copy of a shared folder; secondary servers sync from this.

---

### ‚úÖ NS (Name Server) Record  
- Points to **authoritative DNS servers** for the zone.  
- Every DNS zone **must** have at least one NS record.  
- Zones often have a **primary** and one or more **secondary** servers.  
  - Secondary servers are **read-only**, used for **redundancy** or **load balancing**.

---

### ‚úÖ A (Address) Record  
- Maps a **domain/hostname to an IPv4 address**.  
  - Example: `www.example.com` ‚Üí `192.0.2.5`

### ‚úÖ AAAA Record  
- Maps a **domain to an IPv6 address**.  
  - Example: `example.com` ‚Üí `2001:0db8::1`

---

### ‚úÖ MX (Mail Exchange) Record  
- Identifies **mail servers** for a domain.  
  - Has **priority numbers** (lower = higher priority).  
  - Example: `10 mail.example.com.`

---

### ‚úÖ CNAME (Canonical Name) Record  
- A nickname or **alias for another domain**.  
  - Used when multiple names refer to the same server.  
  - Example: `blog.example.com` ‚Üí `www.example.com`

üîç **Limitation**: CNAME can‚Äôt coexist with other records for the same name.

---

### ‚úÖ TXT Record  
- Allows domain owners to attach **human-readable or machine-verified info**.  
  - Used in **SPF, DKIM**, and **domain ownership verification**.  
  - Example:  
    ```
    "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
    ```

---

### ‚úÖ PTR (Pointer) Record  
- Used for **reverse DNS** lookups (IP ‚Üí name).  
  - Found in **reverse lookup zones**.  
  - Example: `5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa` ‚Üí `host.example.com`

## Summary Table

| Record Type | Purpose                             | Notes                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| SOA         | Start of authority                  | Master info for the DNS zone            |
| NS          | Name server                         | Points to authoritative DNS servers     |
| A           | Address (IPv4)                      | Hostname to IPv4 mapping                |
| AAAA        | Address (IPv6)                      | Hostname to IPv6                        |
| MX          | Mail exchange                       | Prioritized mail server routing         |
| CNAME       | Canonical name                      | Alias of another domain                 |
| TXT         | Text                                | SPF, DKIM, or metadata                  |
| PTR         | Pointer                             | Reverse DNS (IP ‚Üí hostname)             |

üß† Remember:  
- Every DNS **zone** starts with an **SOA** record.  
- Most zones will have **multiple A, NS, MX, and CNAME** records.  
- Records are stored in **zone files** or DNS server configurations.
