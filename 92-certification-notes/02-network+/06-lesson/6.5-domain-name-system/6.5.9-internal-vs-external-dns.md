## 6.5.9 – Internal vs External DNS

### 🧱 Internal DNS

- Used for **private networks** (internal company infrastructure).
- Zones and records are only accessible to **internal clients**.
- Internal DNS zones might serve names like:
  - `pc1.corp.515support.com`
  - `crm.corp.515support.com`
- Typically used with **Active Directory** and local app services.
- **Security tip:** Internal DNS zones **must not** be exposed to the internet.
- Internal name servers are **authoritative** for internal subdomains.

> Example: `corp.515support.com` only resolvable inside the corporate LAN.

---

### 🧱 External DNS

- Serves records meant to be **publicly accessible** via the Internet.
- Hosts public services like:
  - `www.515support.com`
  - `mail.515support.com`
- Enables things like:
  - Users visiting websites
  - Sending/receiving emails
- Records are hosted on DNS servers that are **Internet-facing**.

> Example: External DNS answers for `www.515support.com` and `@515support.com`.

### 🔁 DNS Resolution Logic

- A DNS **resolver** performs **recursive queries** for internal clients.
- Stub resolvers (like on PCs) ask internal DNS to resolve names.
- If a name isn’t in internal DNS:
  - It performs recursion or
  - **Forwards** the query to another resolver.

---

### 🔐 Security Notes

- DNS servers should only allow recursive queries from **trusted internal clients**.
- Best practice: Separate DNS roles:
  - One server for hosting **internal zones**
  - Another for forwarding/recursive queries

---

### 🚀 Conditional Forwarding

- DNS servers can be configured to **forward queries** to another resolver.
- **Conditional forwarding** = forwards only specific domains.
- Example:
  - Internal DNS handles `corp.515support.com`
  - For anything else (e.g., `google.com`), it forwards to ISP DNS.
