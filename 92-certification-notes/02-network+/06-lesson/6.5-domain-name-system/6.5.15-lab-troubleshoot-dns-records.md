## 6.5.15 Lab: Troubleshoot DNS Records  
#networking-plus #dns #lab-notes

### 🧱 Scenario
You're the administrator for the `CorpNet.local` domain.  
CorpDC and CorpDC3 are DNS servers.  
Users report they can’t access the `CorpWeb` server from Building A.

- CorpWeb’s IP address: `192.168.0.15`

### 🧪 Step 1: Test Connectivity

From the client:

```powershell
ping CorpWeb.CorpNet.local   ❌ Fails (host not found)
ping 192.168.0.15            ✅ Success
```

🔍 **Conclusion:** IP is reachable, but DNS name is not resolving.  
➡ No A record exists for `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local`.

### 🛠️ Step 2: Fix DNS on CorpDC

In **DNS Manager**:

1. Expand: `Forward Lookup Zones > CorpNet.local`
2. Right-click → `New Host (A or AAAA)`
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `CorpWeb`
   - **IP Address:** `192.168.0.15`
   - ✅ Check: `Create associated pointer (PTR) record`
4. Add Host → OK → Done

This creates:
```
CorpWeb.CorpNet.local → 192.168.0.15
```

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Retest

```powershell
ping CorpWeb.CorpNet.local   ✅ Success
ping 192.168.0.15            ✅ Still works
```

---

### ✅ Summary

| DNS Issue | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Name not resolving | Missing A record |
| IP reachable | Means network is fine |
| Fix applied at | **CorpDC DNS Server** |

💡 **A record** = maps FQDN to IP  
💡 **PTR record** = reverse lookup (IP ➝ name)

🧭 **Lesson**: If ping by IP works but name fails, check DNS — start at the domain controller.
