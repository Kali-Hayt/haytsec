## 6.5.5 ‚Äì Host Address and Canonical Name Records

### üß± A and AAAA Records
- **A Record (Address Record)** maps a **hostname** to an **IPv4 address**.
  - Example: `mail.example.com` ‚ûù `192.168.1.5`
- **AAAA Record (Quad-A)** maps a **hostname** to an **IPv6 address**.
  - Example: `web.example.com` ‚ûù `2001:db8::1`

### üîç Use in DNS
- Used by DNS servers to resolve hostnames into IP addresses.
- Both types are **host records** and are essential for internet communication.

---

### üß± CNAME Records (Canonical Name)
- Used to define an **alias** for another domain name.
  - Example: `www.example.com` ‚ûù alias for `example.com`
- The CNAME **does not point to an IP**, but instead points to another hostname.
- Helps with easier DNS admin and maintenance.
  - Ex: Temporary redirects during maintenance.

#### ‚úÖ Benefits
- Simplifies changes‚Äîupdate only the canonical name's A/AAAA record.
- Allows one server to serve multiple domains via aliases.

---

### üß± Multiple Resource Records
- A single IP can be linked to **multiple A/AAAA records** (from different hostnames).
- Useful for **redundancy** and **load balancing**.
  - Often implemented as **round-robin DNS**.

---

### üîÅ Dynamic DNS (DDNS)
- **DDNS** allows client devices or DHCP servers to update DNS records automatically.
- Avoids manual creation/deletion by the DNS administrator.
- In Windows, `ipconfig /registerdns` triggers a client to update its record via DDNS.

---

### ‚ùóIPv6 UDP Limitations
- DNS over IPv6 (AAAA records) may exceed UDP size limits (512 bytes).
- Can lead to packet fragmentation or blocking by firewalls.
- Admins must ensure infrastructure supports large UDP packets or fallback to TCP.

---

### üß† Summary
- `A` = IPv4  
- `AAAA` = IPv6  
- `CNAME` = Alias  
- Multiple A/AAAA per name = Load balance  
- DDNS = Auto update by client/DHCP
