### 6.2.4 – DHCP Reservations and Exclusions

## ❌ Problem with Standard DHCP

- DHCP **dynamically assigns IP addresses**, so there's no guarantee a device will get the same one every time.
- This is fine for typical clients, but not for:
  - 🖨️ Printers
  - 📶 Wireless access points
  - 🧠 Monitoring systems
  - 🗄️ File/print servers

These devices **benefit from consistent IPs** for stability and management.

## 🛠️ Static Assignment Options

### ✅ Option 1: Manual Static IP  
- Set directly on the device.
- Must be **outside** the DHCP scope to avoid collisions.
- ❌ Loses centralized control and scalability.

### ✅ Option 2: Exclusion Range  
- Reserve part of the DHCP pool (e.g., 192.168.1.1–1.20).
- DHCP will **not assign** from this exclusion block.
- Used to manually manage certain IPs without changing the scope size.

## 🔒 DHCP Reservations = Static Without Manual Setup

A **reservation** links:
- A device’s **MAC address or interface ID**
- To a specific **IP address** within the DHCP server’s pool

### How it works:
- DHCP server sees a known MAC
- Returns the same IP every time
- Still centrally managed—no device-side config needed

This is called:
- **Static lease**
- **Fixed address assignment**

### 🔍 Distinction:
- **Static IP** = Manually configured on device  
- **Reservation** = Server-automated, MAC-based consistency

🧱 DHCP Reservation = Best of both worlds (dynamic control + static behavior)
