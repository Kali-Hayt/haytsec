### 🧱 DHCP Server Requirements

A **DHCP server** must:

- Be assigned a **static IP address**  
- Be configured with a **pool (range)** of IP addresses to lease  
- Include **subnet masks** and **optional values**, like:
  - Default gateway  
  - DNS server addresses  
  - Lease duration

---

### ✅ DHCP Scopes

A **scope** is the set of IP configuration values assigned to a **single subnet**.

To define a scope, you must specify:

- **Start and end IP address**  
- **Subnet mask**

🧱 Rule: One scope per subnet  
- **No scope can span multiple subnets**  
- **No subnet can contain more than one scope**

---

### 🔍 Scope Behavior in Different Environments

- **Basic DHCP servers** (like a multifunction router) typically support **one scope only**.
- **Enterprise DHCP servers** may manage **multiple scopes** across different subnets.

When servicing multiple scopes:

- The server chooses the **appropriate IP pool** based on the **originating subnet** of the client request.

---

### 🛠️ Subnet Placement Rule

The DHCP server must reside in the **same subnet** as the clients unless:

- A **DHCP relay agent** is used (covered later).
