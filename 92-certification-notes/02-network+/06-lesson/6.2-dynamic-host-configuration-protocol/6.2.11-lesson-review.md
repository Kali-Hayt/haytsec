# QUESTION 1  
What is the purpose of the T1 timer in DHCP?

❌ To indicate the expiration time of an IP address lease  
❌ To set the frequency of DHCP server updates  
✅ To signal when a client should start attempting to renew its lease  
❌ To define the maximum lease time for an IP address  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **To indicate the expiration time of an IP address lease** – That’s the role of the overall lease timer, not T1.  
- ❌ **To set the frequency of DHCP server updates** – DHCP doesn’t "update" at a set frequency; clients initiate lease requests.  
- ❌ **To define the maximum lease time for an IP address** – That’s handled by the lease time configuration, not the T1 timer.

# QUESTION 2  
What is the consequence of a long DHCP lease time?

✅ The DHCP server's available pool of IP addresses is not replenished frequently  
❌ Increases the DHCP server's available pool of IP addresses  
❌ Decreases network security  
❌ Requires frequent renewal of the lease  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Increases the DHCP server's available pool of IP addresses** – Long leases actually *reduce* availability since addresses stay assigned longer.  
- ❌ **Decreases network security** – Lease time doesn’t directly impact security; unrelated.  
- ❌ **Requires frequent renewal of the lease** – Opposite: long leases mean *less* frequent renewal.

# QUESTION 3  
You have a network with 50 workstations. You want to automatically configure the workstations with the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway values.  
Which device should you use?

✅ DHCP server  
❌ Gateway  
❌ DNS server  
❌ Router  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Gateway** – It routes traffic between networks, not responsible for assigning IP configurations.  
- ❌ **DNS server** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses, doesn't assign IPs or subnet masks.  
- ❌ **Router** – Can **include** DHCP functionality, but not always. The role described is DHCP’s.

# QUESTION 4  
What does the client do to ensure the offered IP address is not already in use?

✅ Broadcasts an ARP message  
❌ Sends a DHCPREQUEST packet  
❌ Sends a DHCPOFFER packet  
❌ Sends a DHCPDISCOVER packet  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **DHCPREQUEST** – This confirms acceptance of the offered IP, not for checking conflicts.  
- ❌ **DHCPOFFER** – Sent by the **server**, not the client.  
- ❌ **DHCPDISCOVER** – This is the initial broadcast to find DHCP servers, not for conflict checking.  

🧱 The ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) check is how a client ensures the IP isn't already claimed.

# QUESTION 5  
Why must a DHCP server, without the use of relays, be placed in the same subnet as its clients?

✅ To ensure it can assign IP addresses to them  
❌ To reduce network latency  
❌ To comply with network security policies  
❌ To increase the server's processing speed  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Reduce network latency** – Not the primary reason; latency isn’t the issue here.  
- ❌ **Security policies** – This is unrelated to the basic requirement for DHCP traffic.  
- ❌ **Server processing speed** – Not affected by subnet placement.

🧱 DHCPDISCOVER messages are broadcast and won't cross routers. Without a relay agent, DHCP must be on the same subnet to hear the broadcast and respond.

# QUESTION 6  
What is the significance of configuring a DHCP server with a range of IP addresses and subnet masks?

✅ It enables the server to assign appropriate IP configurations to clients within a specific subnet.  
❌ It encrypts the data transmitted between the server and clients.  
❌ It allows the server to function as a router.  
❌ It allows the server to operate in multiple subnets simultaneously.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Encrypts data** – DHCP does not provide encryption; it’s a plain-text protocol.  
- ❌ **Functions as a router** – DHCP only hands out IP configuration info, not routing functionality.  
- ❌ **Operate in multiple subnets** – That requires additional interfaces or relay agents, not just setting a range.

---
# QUESTION 7  
What is the first step in the DHCP lease process?

❌ DHCPACK  
✅ DHCPDISCOVER  
❌ DHCPOFFER  
❌ DHCPREQUEST  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **DHCPACK** – This is the final step, confirming the lease.  
- ❌ **DHCPOFFER** – Server responds to the initial discover.  
- ❌ **DHCPREQUEST** – Client sends after it selects an offer.

# QUESTION 8  
What is a scope in the context of DHCP server configuration?

❌ A tool for monitoring network traffic  
❌ A set of rules for filtering packets  
❌ The physical range a wireless DHCP server can cover  
✅ A range of IP addresses and options configured for a single subnet  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Monitoring traffic** – That's what tools like Wireshark or IDS systems do, not DHCP.  
- ❌ **Packet filtering** – Refers to firewall or ACL rules, not DHCP.  
- ❌ **Wireless range** – DHCP scopes are logical IP range definitions, unrelated to signal range.


---
# QUESTION 9  
An administrator is using DHCP and wants to retain centralized management of IP addressing but needs to ensure that specific devices that supply always-on functionality have static IP address assignments.  
What is the BEST solution?

❌ Configure static assignments on those devices.  
❌ Assign addresses from a specially configured exclusion range.  
❌ Configure scopes.  
✅ Create reservations.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Static assignments on devices** – Manual, not centralized. Defeats the purpose of using DHCP.  
- ❌ **Exclusion range** – Prevents DHCP from assigning those addresses but doesn’t assign anything.  
- ❌ **Scopes** – Define IP ranges but don’t tie specific IPs to specific MAC addresses.  

---
# QUESTION 10  
Which DHCP option specifies the IP address of the router?

❌ DNS servers  
✅ Default gateway  
❌ NTP servers  
❌ DNS suffix  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **DNS servers** – Used to resolve domain names, not route traffic.  
- ❌ **NTP servers** – Used for time synchronization, irrelevant to routing.  
- ❌ **DNS suffix** – Appends domain names, doesn’t affect IP routing.
