## 8.2.7 Configuration Monitoring  

### 🧱 Configuration Management Concepts

- Goal: Ensure all network devices are in a **known, trusted state**
- Devices can exist in multiple configuration states:

#### 🔧 Configuration States
- **Baseline (Golden) Configuration**
  - Known-good template of how the device *should* be configured
- **Production Configuration**
  - Actual live config currently running on the device
  - May include a **running** config that differs from startup
- **Backup Configuration**
  - Snapshot or archived version of a prior config (e.g., backup of startup/running)

  - ✅ Alarms
- Advanced tools can:

  - Detect drift from baseline
