### üß± What Is Network Discovery?

- The process of identifying what devices are connected to a network and what they‚Äôre doing.
- Crucial for confirming:
  - Devices are in correct VLANs/subnets.
  - No rogue or unauthorized machines are present.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used for Network Discovery

- **IP scanner**: Discovers hosts and maps network topology.
  - Tools: Nmap, Angry IP, PRTG
  - Helps define logical topology (subnets, routers)

- **IPAM (IP Address Management)**:
  - Manages and tracks IP usage
  - Often part of enterprise management tools
  - Includes DHCP + DNS integration
  - Sometimes called DDI (DHCP, DNS, IPAM)

### üîç Host Discovery

- A basic form of IP scanning: determines whether an IP address is **up** (responding).
- Common techniques:
  - `ping`
  - `arp`
  - `traceroute`

- Advanced scans:
  - **SNMP queries** (üß± Simple Network Management Protocol): report interface stats
  - Query DHCP and DNS servers for host data
  - Use of crafted probes to locate stealth hosts (rogue machines)

### üïì When to Scan?

- **Ad hoc**: Done when needed.
- **Scheduled**: Routine checks.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If scans are predictable, attackers may hide activity during those windows.

- Ad hoc = more likely to catch malicious behavior.
- However, scanning too aggressively can disrupt:
  - Network performance
  - Host stability
