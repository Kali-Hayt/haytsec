## 8.2.6 Availability Monitoring  

### 🧠 What is Availability Monitoring?

- An **availability monitor** alerts if a host/service goes down or becomes unresponsive.
- Also called:
  - ✅ Heartbeat monitor  
  - ✅ Uptime monitor

- Works by probing a service and checking for a valid response.
  - Example: HTTP service should return **status code 200** when it's up
- May also track **digital certificate expiry**

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Unavailability

Unresponsive service = multiple clients can't connect. Possible causes:

- ❌ **Crash or failure** of the app, OS, or underlying hardware
- 🚨 **Overloaded server** (high CPU, memory, disk I/O, or disk space)
  - Temporary fix: throttle client connections
- 🚧 **Network congestion** (on client or server side)
  - Use `ping` or `traceroute` to compare to a known **performance baseline**
- 🌪️ **Broadcast storm**
  - Flood of broadcast/unicast traffic from **switching loops**
  - Kills bandwidth and CPU on switches/hosts
  - Use **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)** to prevent loops
  - Use **storm control** to block excessive frames
- 🛡️ **DoS attacks**
  - Sudden spikes in CPU/memory usage or traffic  
  - Investigate access logs or use **GeoIP** to visualize sources and compare to normal patterns
