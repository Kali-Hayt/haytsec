## 8.5.1 Packet Capture  
#networking-plus

A **protocol analyzer** (often called a *packet sniffer*) is a critical tool for network support. It captures frames moving over a network and allows for deep inspection of traffic.

> üîç **Note:** The terms *sniffer* and *protocol analyzer* are often used interchangeably but may be implemented separately.

### üß± How Sniffers Work

- Software-based sniffers are installed on hosts and read frames from the network adapter.
- A special driver is installed to read frames and save them to disk.
- Filters can be applied to limit the amount of captured data.

## Methods of Connecting a Sniffer

### ‚úÖ SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) / Port Mirroring
- Mirror traffic from one or more ports to a monitoring port.
- Simple to configure, but not always reliable under heavy load.
- ‚ùå May drop error frames.

### ‚úÖ Passive TAP (Test Access Point)
- Physical device using optical splitters or inductors to mirror signal.
- No logic decisions‚Äîcopies *everything*, even corrupt frames.
- Unaffected by traffic load.
- ‚ö° Available in copper and fiber versions.

### ‚úÖ Active TAP
- Powered TAP that performs signal regeneration.
- Required for high-speed copper and complex fiber environments.
- Can prevent frame loss due to optical split issues.
- ‚ùå Becomes a single point of failure during power loss.

---

### Additional TAP Notes
- Normally outputs two separate streams for full-duplex links (upstream + downstream).
- **Aggregation TAPs** merge streams into one channel.
  - ‚ùå Risk of dropping frames under high load.
