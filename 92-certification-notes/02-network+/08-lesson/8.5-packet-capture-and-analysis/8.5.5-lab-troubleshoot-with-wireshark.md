### 🧪 Task Summary

You used Wireshark to isolate traffic using the following filters and answered questions about their effects:

---

### Q1: `net 192.168.0.0`

✅ **Correct Answer**: Only packets with either a source or destination address on the 192.168.0.x network are displayed.

🔍 This filter includes all traffic involving any host in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet, both inbound and outbound.

---

### Q2: `host 192.168.0.45`

✅ **Correct Answer**: Only packets with 192.168.0.45 in either the source or destination address are displayed.

🔍 `host` captures traffic going to or coming from a specific IP.

---

### Q3: `ip.src==192.168.0.45`

✅ **Correct Answer**: Only packets with 192.168.0.45 in the source address are displayed.

🔍 Useful for identifying what a host is sending out to the network.

---

### Q4: `ip.dst==192.168.0.45`

✅ **Correct Answer**: Only packets with 192.168.0.45 in the destination address are displayed.

🔍 Focuses solely on what is being received by that host.

---

### Q5: `tcp.port==80`

✅ **Correct Answer**: Only packets with port 80 in either the source or destination port are displayed.

🔍 Shows all HTTP traffic, regardless of direction.

---

### Q6: `eth contains 11:12:13`

✅ **Correct Answer**: Only packets with 11:12:13 in either the source or destination MAC address are displayed.

🔍 Use this for partial MAC lookups across Ethernet frames.

---

### Q7: `tcp contains password`

✅ **Correct Answer**: The captured password is: `hippophobia`

🔍 Searching payloads for sensitive data like this simulates credential interception or poor plaintext practices.

   - Stop capture, answer Q1.

3. **Apply: `host 192.168.0.45`**
   - View traffic to/from that host.
   - Answer Q2.

4. **Apply: `ip.src==192.168.0.45`**
   - Show only traffic sent *from* that host.
   - Answer Q3.

5. **Apply: `ip.dst==192.168.0.45`**

### ✅ Summary

You successfully:
- Captured traffic
- Used precise display filters
- Interpreted both IP and Ethernet layer details
- Identified a plaintext password in transit

This lab strengthens your ability to **pinpoint traffic by field**, isolate conversation direction, and understand **how to investigate real threats** with Wireshark.
