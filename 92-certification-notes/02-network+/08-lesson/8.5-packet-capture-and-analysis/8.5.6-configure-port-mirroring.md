### üéØ Objective

As a network administrator, you need to **mirror all traffic received** on a specific switch port to another port used by your IDS (Intrusion Detection System) for analysis.

---

### üß™ Task Summary

- ‚úÖ Set port **GE26** to **VLAN 1**  
- ‚úÖ Mirror **received traffic from port GE28 to port GE26**  
- ‚úÖ Save the switch configuration to the startup file

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Log into the Cisco Switch
- Open Google Chrome and go to: `http://192.168.0.2`
- Username: `cisco`  
- Password: `cisco`  
- Select **Log In**

---

#### 2. Assign Port GE26 to VLAN 1
- Go to:  
  `VLAN Management > Port VLAN Membership`
- Select **GE26**, then **Join VLAN**
- Under **Select VLAN**, choose **1**
- Click **>** to move VLAN 1 to the attached VLAN pane
- Select **Apply**, then **Close**

---

#### 3. Mirror Port GE28 to GE26 (Rx only)
- Go to:  
  `Administration > Diagnostics > Port and VLAN Mirroring`
- Click **Add**
- Destination Port: **GE26**  
- Source Interface: **GE28**  
- Type: **Rx only** (mirror incoming traffic only)
- Click **Apply**, then **Close**

---

#### 4. Save to Startup Configuration
- Click **Save** (upper right)
- Source File Name: **Running configuration**  
- Destination File Name: **Startup configuration**
- Select **Apply**
- Click **OK**, then **Done**

---

### üîê Result

The switch now mirrors all **incoming traffic on GE28** to GE26 ‚Äî where your IDS can capture it. The change is saved to persist across reboots.

This simulates a basic **SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer)** configuration ‚Äî a foundational skill for network visibility and threat hunting.
