## 8.6.5 Bandwidth Management  
#networking-plus

Managing bandwidth is about **controlling congestion and contention**, and using tools like QoS, DiffServ, and 802.1p to prioritize important traffic.

### ⚠️ Congestion vs. Contention

- **Congestion**:  
  The network can’t keep up with peak demand. Queuing and packet drops occur.

- **Contention**:  
  The ratio between **bandwidth demand vs. available bandwidth**.  
  Example:  
  - 100 video hosts @ 10 Mbps = 1 Gbps demand  
  - 1 Gbps link = 1:1 contention  
  - If 200 hosts = 2:1 contention  
  Use monitoring to decide when the ratio becomes unacceptable.

### 🔧 Managing Congestion/Contention

- **Option 1**: Upgrade bandwidth, switches, and routers  
- **Option 2**: Implement **bandwidth management**

🧱 Example:  
If someone downloads a **40 GB file**, it could **kill VoIP quality** unless traffic is prioritized.

By default, switches/routers forward based on **best-effort** (first-in, first-out).  
To fix that, use **QoS** (Quality of Service) to prioritize traffic types.

### 🎯 Differentiated Services (DiffServ)

- Layer 3 (IP-based) QoS tagging system  
- Uses **Type of Service** field in IPv4 / Traffic Class in IPv6  
- Tags each packet with a **6-bit DSCP (DiffServ Code Point)**  
- Packets with same DSCP = **behavior aggregates**  
- Routers use **Per Hop Behavior (PHB)** to process traffic accordingly

#### DiffServ traffic classes:
- **Best Effort** – no guarantees  
- **Assured Forwarding** – better reliability (multiple sub-classes)  
- **Expedited Forwarding** – for high-priority, low-latency traffic (like VoIP)

### 🧬 IEEE 802.1p

- Works at **Layer 2** (Ethernet), complements or works independently of DiffServ  
- Uses **3-bit priority field** in the 802.1Q VLAN tag (values 0–7)

#### Priority Map:
- **7–6**: Reserved for critical control (e.g., routing protocols)  
- **5–4**: Expedited forwarding (e.g., voice/video)  
- **3–2**: Assured forwarding (e.g., streaming media)  
- **1–0**: Best effort (standard traffic)

📦 VLANs can also be used for traffic separation.  
> Example: Voice traffic might go over a **separate VLAN** from general data.

### ✅ Summary

- **Congestion = can’t keep up**, **Contention = too many users per pipe**  
- Use **QoS**, **DiffServ**, and **802.1p** to prioritize what matters  
- Proper bandwidth planning + tagging = smooth VoIP, no laggy meetings
