## 8.6.4 Traffic Testing Tools  
#networking-plus

Sometimes you can’t *see* performance problems until you simulate them. That’s where **traffic testing tools** come in.

> ⚠️ These tools **can impact performance**, so only run tests when the network isn’t in use.

### 🚀 Throughput Testers

Used to measure **network throughput** by transferring large files between two hosts.

**Example Calculation**:
- 1 GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes = 8,589,934,592 bits  
- 8,589,934,592 bits ÷ 1800 seconds = ~4.55 Mbps

🧱 But this isn’t the full picture:  
- This value includes **overhead** from the Application layer  
- Headers, retransmissions, and errors can affect accuracy

**Tools to automate throughput testing**:
- [`iperf`](https://iperf.fr)
- [`ttcp`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ttcp)
- [`BWPing`](https://bwping.sourceforge.io)

These tools use two hosts:  
One sends traffic, the other listens and measures the results.

### 🧠 Top Talkers / Top Listeners

- **Top talkers** = Interfaces sending the most data  
- **Top listeners** = Interfaces receiving the most data

🛠️ Useful for:
- Identifying **bandwidth hogs**
- Diagnosing **performance bottlenecks**

Most network analyzer tools include **filters** or **reports** to find them.

### 🌐 Bandwidth Speed Testers

Used to measure **Internet** performance, not just LAN.

Two major types:

#### 📶 Broadband Speed Checkers
- Test local Internet performance (SOHO-level)
- Measure:
  - **Downlink/uplink speeds**
  - **Ping latency**
- Can compare results with nearby users on the same ISP

#### 💻 Website Performance Checkers
- Measure how fast a web page loads
- Good for testing **response times from different global regions**

---

### 🧩 Summary

- Simulate traffic to uncover real issues
- Choose the right tool for **LAN**, **Internet**, or **web performance**
- Don’t run tests on production networks unless scheduled
