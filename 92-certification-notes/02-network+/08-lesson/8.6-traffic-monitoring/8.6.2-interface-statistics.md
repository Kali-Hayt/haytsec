## 8.6.2 Interface Statistics

To diagnose a performance issue due to congestion, bottlenecking, bandwidth, or packet loss, you must collect data and configure alerts for **interface statistics**, whether on a network adapter, switch, or router port.

### ‚úÖ Utilization
- Measures **data transferred over time**.
- Can be tracked as bits or bytes per second (or multiples), or as a **percentage of available bandwidth**.
- Includes both **sent and received traffic**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**  
> You must differentiate between **average utilization** and **peak utilization**.  
> - If average = 80%, it might *seem* like there‚Äôs room.
> - But if peak hits 100% often, you may experience:
>   - Packet loss
>   - Delay
>   - Bottlenecks  
> You may need to upgrade the link. Monitoring **queue length** helps reveal bottlenecks.

### ‚úÖ Per-Protocol Utilization
- Tracks **packet or byte counts by protocol**.
- Useful to identify which protocols are consuming the most bandwidth.
- High counts can:
  - Impact CPU and memory on the appliance
  - Cause processing overhead‚Äîeven with small packet sizes

---

### ‚úÖ Error Rate
- Tracks **packets per second with errors**.
- Errors may be caused by:
  - Interference
  - Poor link quality
  - Data corruption
- üîç Target: Error rates should be **< 1%**
- High error rates may suggest:
  - **Driver issues**
  - **Physical media problems**

---

### ‚úÖ Discards / Drops
- An interface may **discard** (reject) or **drop** (fail to deliver) frames.
- Causes vary:
  - Security policy
  - Congestion
  - Hardware limitations

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Vendor Note:**  
> - "Discard" = rejected due to errors or policy  
> - "Drop" = lost due to high load  
> Some vendors use these terms interchangeably.

---

### ‚úÖ Retransmissions
- **Dropped or errored packets must be resent**.
- Common with:
  - Packet loss
  - Link congestion
  - Connectivity misconfiguration
- Results in:
  - Incomplete communication
  - Higher bandwidth usage (retries)
- Must investigate **underlying packet loss** across layers.
