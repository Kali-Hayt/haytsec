## 8.6.3 Flow Data  
#networking-plus

Monitoring individual interface stats is helpfulâ€”but diagnosing **performance issues** demands a more detailed view:  
âœ… **Traffic flow data**.

---

### ðŸ§± Traffic Flows vs. Packet Captures

- A **packet analyzer** (like Wireshark) captures full packet dataâ€”but that means **heavy processing** and bandwidth.
- **Traffic flows** track just **metadata** (not full payloads), which is much lighter on the system.
- Tools like **Cisco NetFlow** sample flow data and export it to a structured database.
- This is often done using the **IPFIX** standard (IP Flow Information Export, [RFC 7011](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7011)).

### âœ… NetFlow Components

NetFlow requires **three components**:

#### 1. **Exporter**  
- Configured on network devices (switches, routers, firewalls).  
- Defines **flows** by analyzing packets that share:
  - Source IP
  - Destination IP
  - Source Port
  - Destination Port
  - Protocol  
- These 5 values = **5-tuple**  
- A **7-tuple** adds:
  - Input interface  
  - IP Type of Service (ToS)

- Exporter:
  - Caches newly seen flows.
  - Sets timers for flow expiration.
  - Sends expired/inactive flows to a **collector**.

#### 2. **Collector**  
- Aggregates data from multiple exporters.
- Needs:
  - High-bandwidth link
  - Lots of storage (can be *huge* volumes)
- Must support **NetFlow v5/v9** or **IPFIX**.

#### 3. **Analyzer**  
- Interprets/query flow data from the collector.
- Can:
  - Generate alerts.
  - Provide reports.
- In real-world setups, **collector + analyzer** are often part of the **same product**.

### ðŸ’¡ Summary

- Flow data gives you **performance visibility** without full packet capture overhead.
- **NetFlow/IPFIX** = scalable metadata tracking.
- Critical for analyzing **traffic patterns**, **troubleshooting**, and **security forensics**.
