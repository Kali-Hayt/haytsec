## 8.1.8 Logical Network Diagrams

In contrast to physical floor plans, **logical diagrams** show an abstract or schematic representation of the network.

Used to illustrate:
- Zones and subnets
- Device interconnects
- IP addressing
- Protocols and services in use

üéØ Logical diagrams emphasize **how** things are connected and communicate‚Äînot where they‚Äôre physically placed.

## Guidelines for Logical Schematics

Avoid information overload.  
üß± Best practice: create **layered diagrams** based on OSI model components:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PHY (Physical Layer)
- Shows:
  - Asset IDs
  - Cable links
  - Patch panel & switch port IDs
- Use:
  - Line styles or color-coding for cable types
  - Clear legends for interpretation

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Link (Layer 2)
- Shows:
  - Switch-to-router interconnects
  - MAC addresses or management IPs
  - Interface IDs
  - Link-layer protocols (e.g., Ethernet)
  - Bandwidth (via line thickness or labels)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Logical (IP/Layer 3)
- Shows:
  - IP addresses of router interfaces
  - VLAN IDs
  - Netmask & DHCP scopes
  - Static IPs and firewall placement
  - IP routes & segmentation

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer
- Shows:
  - Server roles and services
  - TCP/UDP port usage
  - Resource baselines (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth)

üß† This level supports **performance monitoring and capacity planning.**

---

## Tools & Icons

- üõ†Ô∏è Can be built using:
  - Microsoft Visio
  - Network mapping software
- üì¶ Symbols can be:
  - Generic icons
  - Vendor-specific stencils (e.g. Cisco standard icons)

## Summary

| Layer        | What It Shows                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| PHY          | Cables, ports, asset IDs                             |
| Data Link    | Switches, interfaces, bandwidth, MACs                |
| Logical (L3) | IPs, VLANs, routes, firewall placement               |
| Application  | Services, ports, performance stats                   |

Logical diagrams = your **blueprint for understanding network function** at every layer.
