## 8.1.5 Lifecycle Management

Lifecycle management is part of change management and inventory documentation.

### ‚úÖ System Life Cycle
Refers to the **managed acquisition, deployment, use, and decommissioning** of assets.

Inventory tracking helps identify:
- Assets no longer supported by the vendor
- Assets that fail to meet performance or security requirements

---

## EOL vs EOS

- **End of Life (EOL)**: Sales discontinued; support and spare parts become limited.
- **End of Support (EOS)**: No longer receives updates or security patches.
- **EOSL (End of Service Life)**: Sometimes used to describe EOS.

üß± *Using EOS/EOL equipment can lead to security vulnerabilities.*

---

## Patch and Update Management

Every firmware, OS, and app can have vulnerabilities. Vendors fix them via updates‚Äîthreat actors exploit them when unpatched.

- Stay updated via **vendor security advisories**
- Follow a **patch management plan** for hardware and software

---

### Patch Types

- **Patch**: General updates (features, fixes)
- **Hotfix**: Quick fix that avoids downtime
- **Coldfix**: Fix that needs reboot
- **Bugfix**: Usually handled in dev/testing phase

---

## Firmware Management

Devices like routers/firewalls rely on firmware.

- Firmware = software controlling the hardware
- Vulnerabilities are common‚Äîmust use secure versions
- Updating firmware = ‚Äúflashing the chip‚Äù using vendor tools

üß† Always back up system configs before flashing.

### Patch Example: Cisco IOS

To patch Cisco IOS:
- Use a tool like the **IOS Software Checker**:  
  [https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x)
- Identify the **first fix** for a known vulnerability
- Carefully test to avoid breaking other features

---

## Upgrade Procedure

1. Check compatibility and environment
2. Back up the system
3. Copy the new image to flash memory via:
   - TFTP
   - Remote file copy
   - USB/removable media
4. Run boot command to load new image

---

## Downgrade Procedure

- "Rollback" means restoring a previous version
- Can fix problems caused by a bad patch or upgrade
- **Caution**: Not all systems allow rollback!
  - May require full reinstall (e.g., firmware)
  - Backups might not be compatible with old version

---

## Summary

- Track lifecycle status (EOL, EOS, EOSL)
- Keep firmware and software patched
- Validate updates before deployment
- Always back up before changes

üß± Lifecycle planning reduces risk and avoids surprises when support ends or vulnerabilities appear.
