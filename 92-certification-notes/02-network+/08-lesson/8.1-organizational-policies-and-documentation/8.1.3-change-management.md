## 8.1.3 Change Management

A documented **change management** process minimizes the risk of configuration drift and unscheduled downtime by implementing changes in a planned and controlled way.

There are two common types of change:
- **Reactive**: Change is forced on the organization (e.g., response to failure).
- **Proactive**: Change is initiated internally to improve systems.

Changes can also be categorized by:
- **Impact**: major, significant, minor, normal
- **Risk level**: high, medium, low

### ðŸ“„ Request for Change (RFC)

In a formal change process:
- The need for change is documented in an **RFC**.
- The RFC is reviewed and approved at the proper level.
- Stakeholders are notified.
- Major changes may require approval from a **Change Advisory Board (CAB)**.

### ðŸ›  Change Authorization & SOPs

Changes should only occur when:
- A **service request ticket** is issued.
- The change is approved and logged in job records.

Each task should follow a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**:
- Defines goals, standards, responsibilities, and authorizations.
- May include work instructions or detailed task steps.

### ðŸŽ« Ticket System Benefits

Using a ticket system allows for:
- Documented requests and approvals
- Stakeholder tracking
- Defined rollback plans
- Progress monitoring
- Implementation and testing control
