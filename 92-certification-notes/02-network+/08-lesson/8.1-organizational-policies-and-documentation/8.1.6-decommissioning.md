## 8.1.6 Decommissioning

Each system reaches a **decommissioning** phase in its lifecycle.

When a system (server, switch, router, printer, firewall) is disposed of—by resale, recycling, or donation—there’s a **risk**:
- 🛑 Software licenses might be misused
- 🛑 Configuration data could leak to attackers

✅ Always perform a factory reset to wipe custom settings.  
⚠️ But factory resets may leave **data remnants** behind.

## Data Remnants

🧱 Remnants = residual data that may still exist after reset or deletion  
📛 **Critical** to remove these before disposal or repurposing!

### Sources:
- Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
- Solid-State Drives (SSDs)
- Flash drives
- Tape media
- Optical media (CDs/DVDs)
- Paper documents

### Methods:
- **Destroy** the media (incinerate, pulverize, degauss)
- **Sanitize** the media (wipe data while keeping hardware usable)

---

## Media Sanitization

Sanitization = erasing data before reuse/disposal

### Methods:
- **Overwriting (zero-fill)**: overwrite all data with zeros
  - 🧱 Single-pass zero fill may leave traces
- **Secure overwrite**: one pass zeros, one pass ones, then pseudorandom data
- Done via:
  - Firmware utility
  - Third-party wiping tool

---

## 🔒 Secure Erase (SE)

Since 2001, SATA and SAS specs include a **Secure Erase (SE)** command.

- Executes a zero-fill wipe
- Invoked by tools like `hdparm` (Linux) or vendor utilities
- SSDs use **block-level erase** with wear-leveling
- ⚠️ SE can appear successful, but may not wipe **all blocks** if garbage collection doesn't complete

---

## 🔐 Instant Secure Erase (ISE)

Available on **Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs)**

- Uses **SANITIZE** command to do a **crypto erase**
- Erases the **Media Encryption Key (MEK)** instead of wiping all data
- Once MEK is gone, encrypted data is **instantly unrecoverable**

---

## Summary

- 🧠 Never assume factory reset = secure
- 🛡️ Use correct method: destruction or sanitization
- 🧰 SSDs and HDDs have different erase methods
- 🔐 Crypto erase (ISE) is fastest + most secure for SEDs
