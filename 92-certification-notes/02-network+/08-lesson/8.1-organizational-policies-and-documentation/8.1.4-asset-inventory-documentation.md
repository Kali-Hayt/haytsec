## 8.1.4 Asset Inventory Documentation

To support configuration and change management, it's crucial for an organization to have an inventory of its **tangible and intangible assets**.

### ✅ Hardware Assets
- Network appliances (routers, switches, threat management devices, access points)
- Servers and workstations
- Passive infrastructure: cabling, patch panels

### ✅ Software Assets
- Operating systems
- Applications

---

## Inventory Tools

Organizations use software and hardware tools to manage inventory.

An **Asset Management Database (AMDB)** can be customized to track:
- Type
- Model
- Serial number
- Asset ID
- Location
- User(s)
- Value
- Service/warranty info

🧱 *You can store as much or as little data as needed—flexibility is key.*

---

## Warranty Support and Licensing

Each asset record should include:
- ✅ Invoice
- ✅ Warranty/support contract
- ✅ Support and troubleshooting documentation

For software, **license usage tracking** is essential to ensure legal compliance with vendor agreements.

### Common Pitfalls:
- 🧱 Licensing for servers/network gear is complex
- ❌ Misconfigurations are easy
- ❌ Expired trial/evaluation periods can cause failure
- ❌ Missing/incorrect license keys
- ❌ Device can't reach activation server

---

## Troubleshooting License Issues

Start by checking **logs**:
- 🔍 Has the trial expired?
- 🔍 Has the seat/instance limit been exceeded?

Verify:
- ✅ Correct licenses/keys are installed
- ✅ Device can connect to its licensing server

---

## Summary

Maintaining asset inventory helps:
- Ensure smooth configuration changes
- Prevent licensing violations
- Speed up troubleshooting
- Support lifecycle management

🧠 Pro tip: Don't just track hardware—software licenses and support contracts are just as vital.
