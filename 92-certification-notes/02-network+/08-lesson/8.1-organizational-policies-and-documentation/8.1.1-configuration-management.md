## 8.1.1 Configuration Management

Running an efficient network isn‚Äôt just about installing cabling and routers. It‚Äôs also about managing what you‚Äôve built. Configuration management ensures that everything is documented, tracked, and monitored throughout its life.

## üß± What Is Configuration Management?

**Configuration management** = identifying and documenting all infrastructure and devices installed at a site. The goal is to maintain the desired state of the IT system throughout its lifecycle.

### Key Elements:
- **Service assets**: Any resource (hardware, software, process, or person) that helps deliver an IT service. Must be labeled for tracking.
- **Configuration item (CI)**: A specific asset that requires management. CIs have attributes and are essential to service delivery.
- **CMS (Configuration Management System)**: Tools and databases to track, update, and present info about CIs. 
  - Small networks might use spreadsheets.
  - Enterprises use dedicated CMS software.

## üß± Configuration States

Understanding config management means knowing the different states of configuration:

### ‚úÖ Baseline
- **Approved** or **authorized** state of a CI.
- Used for comparison and auditing.
- Example: ACLs or performance thresholds.
- Sometimes called **golden configuration**.

### ‚úÖ Production Configuration
- The **live state** of a CI in the network.
- Might deviate temporarily or permanently from the baseline.
- This deviation = **configuration drift**.

### ‚úÖ Backup Configuration
- A **snapshot** of the production config at a point in time.
- Useful if production config drifts.
- Might also drift from the baseline if not kept updated.

## üîç Monitoring and Drift Control

- Compare **production** and **backup** against the **baseline**.
- If drift is found:
  - Revert to golden config
  - Or update the baseline (after testing and validation)
- **Change management procedures** are critical to handle drift without introducing chaos.

## Summary

- Configuration Management is your map, inventory, and blueprint.
- Without it, your network turns into a black box.
- Stay disciplined: Document, baseline, back up, monitor, and test before you trust.
