## 8.1.7 Physical Network Diagrams

üß± Physical network diagrams are a key part of asset and configuration item (CI) documentation.

They help visualize:
- How hardware components are physically connected
- Where wiring routes and ports are located
- How power and infrastructure are laid out

‚ö†Ô∏è Too much detail = clutter  
‚úÖ Goal = clarity, simplicity, usefulness

## Types of Physical Diagrams

### üìå Cable Maps

A **cable map** (or floor plan):
- Shows how wires are routed from telecom closets to wall ports
- Documents conduit routes, patch panel connections, and floor drops

**Used to:**
- Map office wall port locations
- Trace cable runs
- Plan floor-level network wiring

üß† Physically accurate cable maps often require help from an architect or graphics pro.

### üîå Wiring Diagrams

A **wiring diagram** (or pin-out):
- Shows **how individual wires are terminated**
- Used for:
  - Twisted pairs (e.g. RJ45 jack pinouts)
  - Fiber optic strand termination
  - IDC (Insulation Displacement Connector) layouts

‚úÖ Use this when installing jacks or fiber trays!

### üóÇÔ∏è Rack Diagrams

A **rack diagram** shows:
- Physical position of devices in a rack
- Power and port layout (UPS to PSU connections)
- Labels for:
  - Port IDs
  - Service tags
  - Links to config files

Tools like [visiocafe.com](https://visiocafe.com) offer equipment stencils.

üß∞ *Use these to prep data center layouts or server closets.*

|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Cable Map        | Shows wire routing & wall port layout  | Often used with floor plans                        |
| Wiring Diagram   | Shows wire termination (RJ45, fiber)   | Crucial for connector and jack pin-outs            |
| Rack Diagram     | Shows device placement in server rack  | Includes UPS/PSU links, tags, config refs          |

üß† Use physical diagrams to **support troubleshooting, upgrades, and audits**.
