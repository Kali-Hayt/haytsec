## 8.1.2 Network Device Backup Management

Backups are vital to business continuity and disaster recovery. In networking, backup policies focus less on data and more on restoring **faulty infrastructure** like switches, routers, firewalls, and load balancers.

Each network device must have:

- A **documented baseline configuration**
- A **deployment method** to apply this config or a backup to new/replaced devices

ðŸ§± Common backup complications:

- Network appliances often have both:
  - **Startup (persistent) config**
  - **Running config**
- These *should* be the same, but sometimes changes arenâ€™t saved permanently.
- Audits and CM procedures must check for drift between saved and running configs.
- Drift from baseline cannot always be safely revertedâ€”you may need to **update the baseline** instead.

âœ… Devices may also support **version history** of previous configs for rollback.

Backup modes:

- **State/bare metal** â€” A full snapshot image of the system. Can restore to identical hardware.
- **Configuration file** â€” A structured file (e.g., XML) that restores system state after the OS/firmware is reinstalled.

Advanced notes:

- Some **state info isnâ€™t logged** and wonâ€™t be saved in config file backups.
  - Ex: MAC address tables, NAT tables, IDS signatures
- Some devices log state to internal DBs or use **syslog** to push it externally.

ðŸ§± To protect state data:
- Enable periodic logging
- Use remote logging (e.g., to a syslog server)
