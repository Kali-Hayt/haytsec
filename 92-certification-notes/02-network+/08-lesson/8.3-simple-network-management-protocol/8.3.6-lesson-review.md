# QUESTION 1  
**What is the purpose of a community string in SNMP?**

- ✅ To serve as a type of password  
- ❌ To identify the network topology  
- ❌ To encrypt data packets  
- ❌ To increase network speed  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *To identify the network topology* — SNMP doesn’t map topology directly; it queries status/data from agents, not layout.  
- ❌ *To encrypt data packets* — SNMP v2c community strings are plaintext; only SNMPv3 supports encryption.  
- ❌ *To increase network speed* — SNMP has no role in speeding up the network; it just monitors and manages devices.

# QUESTION 2  
**Which version of SNMP supports encryption and strong user-based authentication?**

- ❌ SNMP v4  
- ❌ SNMP v1  
- ✅ SNMP v3  
- ❌ SNMP v2c  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *SNMP v4* — There is no SNMP version 4. v3 is the latest standard.  
- ❌ *SNMP v1* — Very basic and insecure; no support for encryption or advanced authentication.  
- ❌ *SNMP v2c* — Uses plaintext community strings; still lacks encryption and robust authentication.

# QUESTION 3  
**Where are the statistics relating to the activity of each device kept?**

- ❌ Trap  
- ✅ MIB  
- ❌ Get  
- ❌ OID  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Trap* — A trap is an alert sent by the agent when a specific event occurs (e.g., port failure), not a place to store data.  
- ❌ *Get* — This is a command used by the monitor to request info; it doesn't store anything.  
- ❌ *OID* — An OID identifies specific variables in the MIB, but the **data itself is stored in the MIB**.

# QUESTION 4  
**What is a major security weakness of SNMP v2c?**

- ❌ It restricts management operations to known hosts.  
- ✅ It sends community strings in plaintext.  
- ❌ It uses strong encryption by default.  
- ❌ It supports too many users.  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *It restricts management operations to known hosts* — That’s actually a **recommended security measure**, not a weakness.  
- ❌ *It uses strong encryption by default* — SNMP v2c uses **no encryption at all**.  
- ❌ *It supports too many users* — SNMP v2c doesn't even have user-based authentication; it uses shared community strings.

# QUESTION 5  
**What mode in SNMPv3 does not encrypt packets but requires authentication?**

- ✅ authNoPriv  
- ❌ authPriv  
- ❌ privAuth  
- ❌ noAuthNoPriv  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *authPriv* — This mode **does encrypt** packets and also requires authentication.  
- ❌ *privAuth* — Invalid; not an actual SNMPv3 mode.  
- ❌ *noAuthNoPriv* — Neither encrypts **nor** authenticates — it's the least secure mode.
