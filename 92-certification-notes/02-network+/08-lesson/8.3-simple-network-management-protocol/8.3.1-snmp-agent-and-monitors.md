## 8.3.1 SNMP Agents and Monitors

Stand-alone devices may offer web consoles for performance and environmental monitoring. However, local access doesnâ€™t scale well when managing tens or hundreds of devices.

The **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** is a widely used framework for remotely managing and monitoring servers and network appliances. It consists of **agents** and a **monitoring system**.

## ðŸ§± SNMP Agents

An SNMP agent is a **process** (software or firmware) running on a switch, router, server, or other SNMP-compatible device. A device running an agent is called a **managed device**.

The agent stores performance/activity data in a **Management Information Base (MIB)**. This includes metrics like frames per second, port status, etc.

- Each data point in the MIB is referenced by an **Object Identifier (OID)**.
- OIDs are arranged in a tree structure: some generic to SNMP, others vendor-defined.

Agents are configured using a **community string**, which is like a basic password. Only monitors with the same string can communicate with the agent.

- Typically, two strings are used:
  - One for **read-only** access
  - One for **read-write** (privileged) access

## ðŸ“¡ SNMP Monitor

An SNMP monitor is the **central management software** used to oversee network activity.

It polls SNMP agents at regular intervals, retrieves MIB data, and displays info for admins to review or act upon. It also processes alerts from agents, known as **traps**.

Monitors retrieve data using two main methods:

- `Get` â€” Polls the agent for a specific OID (used for regular status checks).
- `Trap` â€” Agent sends unsolicited alerts for critical events (e.g., port failure).

Monitors can also:

- Use the `Set` command to change variables
- Walk the MIB tree using `Get` and `Get Next` to discover full layouts

### ðŸ”Œ Ports
- SNMP data queries use **UDP port 161**
- SNMP traps are sent over **UDP port 162**
