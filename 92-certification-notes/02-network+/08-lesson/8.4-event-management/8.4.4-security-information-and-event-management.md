## 8.4.4 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

### üîÑ Log Aggregation vs Collection
- **Log aggregation** involves normalizing and combining data from various sources into a **consistent, searchable format**.
- It can also **summarize repetitive events** by counting instances.
- Aggregated logs give clearer, condensed insight into trends or incidents.

### üõ† What a SIEM Does

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**:
- Integrates **network and security monitoring**
- Performs **automated collection**, aggregation, and **analysis** of log data

SIEMs aggregate logs from:
- Windows & Linux systems  
- Switches, routers  
- Firewalls, IDS  
- Vulnerability & malware scanners  
- Databases

### üß© How SIEM Aggregates Logs

- SIEM software uses **connectors or plug-ins** to **parse and normalize** log data across vendors and platforms
- Uses **regex** or parsing rules to map log content to standard fields in SIEM
- Normalizes **time zones and date formats** into a single timeline

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Integration with APIs

- Monitoring/logging tools can be integrated via **API (Application Programming Interface)**
- Example:  
  A configuration monitor with an API may allow a SIEM to **trigger scans** and **receive results** directly.

‚úÖ A well-configured SIEM gives visibility across the entire infrastructure and accelerates incident detection and response.
