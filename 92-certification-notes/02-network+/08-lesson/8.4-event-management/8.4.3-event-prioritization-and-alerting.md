## 8.4.3 Event Prioritization and Alerting

Network devices can generate thousands of events per hour.  
A system must be in place to **prioritize critical events** over informational ones.

### üõ† Event Categorization Examples:
- **Windows**: Informational, Warning, Critical
- **Audit logs**: Success or Fail

## üî¢ Syslog Severity Levels

| Code | Level         | Interpretation                                           |
|------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Emergency     | The system is unusable (e.g., kernel panic)              |
| 1    | Alert         | Fault requires immediate remediation                     |
| 2    | Critical      | Fault will likely require remediation soon               |
| 3    | Error         | Nonurgent fault has developed                            |
| 4    | Warning       | Nonurgent fault likely to develop                        |
| 5    | Notice        | State could lead to error if ignored                     |
| 6    | Informational | Normal but reportable event                              |
| 7    | Debug         | Verbose info for dev/testing                             |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logging Level Control

Each host‚Äôs logging configuration defines:
- **Max level recorded or forwarded**  
- Example: If logging level is set to `4`, levels `5`, `6`, and `7` are **not forwarded**

---

## üö® Alerts vs Notifications

**Alert**:  
- Triggered when specific event thresholds or patterns are detected  
- Can signal:  
  - Packet loss  
  - Bandwidth drop  
  - Session count  
  - Delay/jitter  
  - Heartbeat failures  
  - Anomalous behavior

**Notification**:  
- The **message** sent after an alert is triggered  
- Low priority = displayed in dashboard  
- High priority = triggers emails, SMS, or physical alerts

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Alerting Balance

- Avoid overwhelming alert noise  
- Ensure alerts don‚Äôt hinder user productivity  
- Prioritize clarity over volume

---

## üßæ Alert Handling Process

- Acknowledge and dismiss alerts properly  
- **Serious alerts** = escalate as incident, assign ticket  
- **False positives** = dismiss  
- Avoid dashboard clutter ‚Äî makes it harder to see new threats
