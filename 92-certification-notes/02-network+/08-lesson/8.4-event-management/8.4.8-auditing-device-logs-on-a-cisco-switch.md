## 8.4.7 Lab: Evaluate Event Logs in pfSense  
**Objective:** Identify signs of an on-path (man-in-the-middle) attack by reviewing DHCP log entries.

### Key Actions
- Logged into pfSense at `http://198.28.56.22/status_logs.php`
- Navigated to: `Status > System Logs > DHCP`
- Evaluated DHCP log entries for suspicious behavior

### ✅ Answered Lab Question:
**Q:** What, if any, indication is there of an on-path attack?  
✅ **A:** There are two DHCPACK entries with the same IP and MAC address.

### 🔍 Why It Matters
- Duplicate DHCPACKs with identical IP/MAC often point to rogue DHCP servers or spoofing attempts.
- This is a classic sign of a **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** setup, where an attacker attempts to impersonate the legitimate network gateway.
