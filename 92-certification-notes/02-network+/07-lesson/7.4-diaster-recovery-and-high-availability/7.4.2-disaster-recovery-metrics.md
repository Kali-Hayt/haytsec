## 7.4.2 â€“ Disaster Recovery Metrics
#disaster-recovery #metric 

Disaster recovery planning relies on **metrics** to express how reliable services are and how long it takes to recover from critical events. These metrics guide planning, policy, and SLA expectations.

### âœ… Availability and Downtime

- **Availability**: The percentage of time a system is operational (typically measured over one year).
- **Downtime**: The percentage or time during which the system is *not* available.

**High Availability (HA)** = ability of a system to stay online continuously.

> **MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)**:  
> The **maximum total time** a business function or system can be unavailable **without unacceptable consequences**.  
> It includes **scheduled outages** (maintenance) and **unscheduled outages** (incidents).

ðŸ§± Example metrics:
| Availability | Annual MTD (hh:mm:ss) |
|--------------|------------------------|
| 99.9999%     | 00:00:32               |
| 99.999%      | 00:05:15               |
| 99.99%       | 00:52:34               |
| 99.9%        | 08:45:36               |
| 99%          | 87:36:00               |

### âœ… Continuous Availability

Systems requiring **almost no downtime at all** are considered **continuously available**.

Used for:
- Life-or-death systems
- Medical devices
- Air traffic control
- Communication satellites
- Smart transportation

### ðŸ”§ Key Recovery Metrics

#### ðŸŸ¦ Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- The **maximum time allowed** to detect the issue, respond, and restore.
- Measures **how long a system can be down** before recovery must be completed.
- Includes: alerting, decision-making, backup restoration.

#### ðŸŸ¦ Work Recovery Time (WRT)
- The **time after RTO** to restore full functionality:
  - Reintegration
  - Testing
  - Briefing users
  - Resyncing workflows

> ðŸ§± **RTO + WRT â‰¤ MTD**

---

### âœ… Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- The **maximum acceptable amount of data loss**, measured in time.
- Represents the **"age" of the most recent backup** that can be used for recovery.

> Example:  
> If RPO = 24 hours, then **data loss of up to 24 hours is tolerable**.  
> Anything older than 24 hours is unacceptable.

### Summary

| Metric | What It Measures | Importance |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **MTD** | Total downtime a business can tolerate | Sets upper limit |
| **RTO** | Max time allowed for system to come back | Measures downtime window |
| **WRT** | Time to return to full ops post-recovery | Ensures stability |
| **RPO** | Acceptable data loss in time | Backup timing target |
