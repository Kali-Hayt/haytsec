### 🧱 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)  
A **DRP** addresses **large-scale network outages** that threaten the performance or security of an entire site.

A proper DRP should:  
- ✅ **Identify disaster scenarios** (natural and man-made) and plan protections  
- ✅ **Define tasks, resources, and responsibilities** (e.g., failover, restore from backup)  
- ✅ **Train staff** on how to respond to disasters

---

### 🧪 Testing the DRP  

#### Tabletop Exercises  
- Teams **discuss hypothetical disaster scenarios** (e.g., earthquake wipes out a site)  
- No systems touched — it’s a **dry run** to test planning and communication  
- Helps expose **gaps in decision-making and coordination**

#### Validation Tests  
- Real **simulations of failover**  
- Test restoring from backup configs and data  
- Check if **recovery time metrics** are met  
- Reveal **hidden dependencies or failures** in the plan

### 🔁 Business Continuity vs Disaster Recovery  

#### Business Continuity Plan (BCP)  
- AKA Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)  
- Focus: **Keep business running** despite the disaster  
- Broader than DRP — covers all functions, not just IT  

#### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)  
- Focus: **Recover IT systems & data**  
- Subset of the BCP  

---

### 🔍 BIA and IT Contingency  

#### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)  
- Identifies **mission-critical business functions**  
- Assesses **risk of failure** if those can't be fulfilled  

#### IT Contingency Planning (ITCP / ITSCP)  
- Ensures essential IT systems have **redundancy and resilience**  
- Goal: **Eliminate single points of failure**

✅ DRP = Recover IT  
✅ BCP = Keep business running  
✅ BIA = What’s critical  
✅ ITCP = Keep IT alive
