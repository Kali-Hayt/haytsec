## 7.2.5 Server Message Block  
#networking-plus

- **SMB (Server Message Block)** is used in Windows networks for sharing files and printers.
- It allows a host to share its files/directories/printers for access by other machines.
- On Linux/UNIX systems, SMB is often implemented via **Samba**.
  - Example: Samba lets Windows clients access Linux shares like native Windows shares.
  - Also allows Linux clients to access Windows file/printer shares.

### Ports
- **Legacy mode**: Used **NetBIOS over TCP** on port **139** (and sometimes 137–139).
- **Modern usage**: Uses **TCP port 445** directly.
- SMB traffic should be **restricted to local networks**.
- Perimeter firewalls should **block NetBIOS ports (137–139)** and **filter port 445** unless needed.

### Security
- **SMBv3** supports **message encryption**, configurable per share or per server.
- Encrypted SMB shares require **SMB 3.0 or higher** to access.
