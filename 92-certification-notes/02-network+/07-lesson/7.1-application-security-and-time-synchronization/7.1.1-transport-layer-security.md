## 7.1.1 Transport Layer Security  
#networking-plus  

### 🔐 Why TLS Exists  
- Original TCP/IP protocols lacked security—no authentication or encryption.
- Data was sent in plaintext, making it vulnerable to:
  - Spoofing  
  - Eavesdropping  
  - Unauthorized modification  

✅ **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** was developed by the IETF to secure communications over TCP/IP.

### 🧱 What TLS Does  
- Operates between the Application and Transport layers (Session Layer in OSI).
- Encrypts and authenticates TCP connections.
- Secure version of HTTP is **HTTPS**.
- TLS also secures:  
  - DNS  
  - NTP  
  - FTP  
  - POP3/IMAP  
  - SMTP  
  - LDAP  
- Secure protocols often use different ports than their insecure counterparts.

> 🔍 **DTLS** (Datagram TLS) allows TLS to work over UDP, often used in VPNs.

### 🔏 How TLS Works  
1. **Server has a digital certificate** issued by a trusted **Certificate Authority (CA)**.
2. When a client connects:
   - Server presents its certificate.
   - Client verifies it—assumes CA is trustworthy.
3. Certificate contains:
   - A **public key**
   - The corresponding **private key** stays secret on the server.

---

### 🔐 Encryption Setup  
- TLS uses a **cipher suite** to establish an encrypted tunnel.
- Even if an attacker records traffic and knows the public key:
  - They can’t decrypt it without the **private key**.
- TLS protects the session from:
  - Interception  
  - Tampering  

> 🧠 **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: Even if private key is compromised, past traffic stays encrypted.

---

### 🔄 TLS Versions and Compatibility  
- Latest: **TLS 1.3**  
- Many servers allow only TLS 1.2 or 1.3 due to older version vulnerabilities.
- Server and client must agree on:
  - TLS version  
  - Cipher suite  

> ❌ **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**, the predecessor to TLS, is **obsolete**.
