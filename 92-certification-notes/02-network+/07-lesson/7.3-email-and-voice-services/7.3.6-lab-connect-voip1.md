### 🧪 Verification Steps

- Powered on IP phones — checked for display
- Turned on Exec workstation — verified auto-login
- Navigated to `Settings > Network & Internet`
- Confirmed **active network connection** from Windows 11 status

---

### 🧠 Notes

- VoIP phones often provide a **pass-through** PC port so a single wall jack can serve both the phone and computer.
- VLAN tagging and PoE not covered in this lab, but relevant in real deployments.
- Always test new IP phone installs with **echo or loopback calls** if available.

### 🧠 Analogy

> The VoIP phone in this setup is like a **bridge**: it connects to the network and then passes traffic on to the workstation—keeping everything streamlined without running more cables.
