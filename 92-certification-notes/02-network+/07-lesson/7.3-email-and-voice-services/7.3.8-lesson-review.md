# QUESTION 1
What is the purpose of using a tel: URI scheme in SIP systems?

❌ To encrypt voice communications  
✅ To dial a landline or cell phone  
❌ To compress audio data for transmission  
❌ To assign unique identifiers to devices  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To encrypt voice communications**: Encryption is handled by protocols like SRTP or SIPS, not by the URI scheme.
- ❌ **To compress audio data for transmission**: That's the job of codecs like G.711 or G.729, not `tel:` URIs.
- ❌ **To assign unique identifiers to devices**: Devices use MAC addresses, IPs, or SIP URIs—`tel:` is for phone numbers.

🧱 Think of `tel:` as a direct dial shortcut—like clicking a contact card that rings a real-world phone.

# QUESTION 2
Which of the following is a unique identifier used by SIP endpoints?

❌ IP address  
❌ MAC address  
✅ SIP URI  
❌ DNS name  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **IP address**: May change with DHCP; not reliable for endpoint identity.
- ❌ **MAC address**: Tied to hardware—not used for routing SIP messages.
- ❌ **DNS name**: Resolves to IPs but doesn’t uniquely identify the SIP user or session.

🧱 **SIP URI** looks like an email (e.g., `sip:alice@example.com`) and is the proper way to route and identify SIP endpoints across networks.

# QUESTION 3
What is the purpose of the STARTTLS command in SMTP?

❌ To create a new email account  
❌ To encrypt the entire email message content  
✅ To upgrade an existing unsecure connection to use TLS  
❌ To downgrade the connection to an unsecure state  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To create a new email account**: Account creation is not handled by SMTP at all.
- ❌ **To encrypt the entire email message content**: STARTTLS only encrypts the *transport layer*, not the full message.
- ❌ **To downgrade the connection to an unsecure state**: Opposite of what STARTTLS does—it *upgrades* to encrypted.

🧱 STARTTLS is a way to negotiate TLS encryption *after* starting a plaintext SMTP session. It's like saying mid-conversation: “Hey, let’s speak in code from now on.”

# QUESTION 4
What is one of the primary purposes of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)?

❌ To connect to web servers  
❌ To encrypt email messages  
✅ To manage a mailbox on a server  
❌ To deliver email to hosts that are permanently available  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To connect to web servers**: That’s the job of HTTP/HTTPS, not IMAP.
- ❌ **To encrypt email messages**: IMAP may use TLS for security, but it doesn’t encrypt email content itself.
- ❌ **To deliver email to hosts that are permanently available**: That’s SMTP’s role. IMAP is *not* a delivery protocol.

🧱 IMAP = “cloud inbox” for your email. It keeps your messages on the server so you can check them from anywhere—like a web-based mailbox synced across devices.

# QUESTION 5
What is a significant difference between a TDM PBX and a VoIP PBX?

❌ A TDM PBX can only support voice mail, while a VoIP PBX cannot.  
❌ A TDM PBX uses the Internet for all calls, while a VoIP PBX uses the PSTN.  
✅ A TDM PBX is supplied as vendor-specific hardware, while a VoIP PBX can be implemented as software.  
❌ A VoIP PBX requires a separate data channel for each call, while a TDM PBX does not.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Voice mail** isn’t the dividing line. Both systems can support it depending on setup.
- ❌ **TDM uses the PSTN** (public switched telephone network), not the Internet. VoIP uses the Internet.
- ❌ **VoIP doesn't need separate physical data channels**—it uses packets over shared IP networks.

🧱 VoIP PBX = flexible, software-driven, can run on a VM.  
🧱 TDM PBX = hardware-bound, circuit-switched, old-school telco tech.

# QUESTION 6
What does SMTP use to discover the IP address of the recipient's SMTP server?

✅ The domain name part of the recipient's email address  
❌ The sender's IP address  
❌ The recipient's email password  
❌ The recipient's physical address  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Sender's IP** is unrelated to locating the recipient’s mail server.
- ❌ **Recipient’s email password** isn’t needed just to send an email; only needed for login.
- ❌ **Physical address** has nothing to do with internet routing or mail server lookup.

🧱 SMTP looks up **MX (Mail Exchange)** records for the **domain part** (e.g., `example.com`) using DNS.  
This tells it which IP address to deliver the message to.

# QUESTION 7
In a Windows environment, which protocol is typically used to access Microsoft Exchange mailboxes?

✅ MAPI  
❌ SMTP  
❌ HTTPS  
❌ IMAP  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **SMTP** is for sending email, not accessing mailboxes.
- ❌ **HTTPS** can be used by Outlook Web Access (OWA), but not typically for direct mailbox access in native clients.
- ❌ **IMAP** is a generic mailbox access protocol, but **Exchange prefers MAPI** for full feature integration (calendar, contacts, etc.).

🧱 MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) is Microsoft’s native protocol used with Outlook and Exchange.  
It supports richer features than IMAP—like shared mailboxes, calendars, and GAL (Global Address List).

# QUESTION 8
What is a key advantage of using VoIP technology over traditional PSTN lines?

✅ Ability to transmit voice over IP networks  
❌ Limited call routing options  
❌ Requirement for separate voice and data channels  
❌ Higher call costs  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Limited call routing options** is false—VoIP *expands* routing options, including dynamic and cloud-based routing.
- ❌ **Requirement for separate voice and data channels** describes PSTN, not VoIP. VoIP merges both over a single data channel.
- ❌ **Higher call costs** is the opposite of reality—VoIP typically reduces costs, especially for long-distance calls.

🧱 VoIP rides the same infrastructure as data, enabling flexibility, reduced hardware, remote use, and scalability.

# QUESTION 9  
How do VoIP phones use VLAN tagging?

✅ To ensure that SIP control and RTP media protocols are segregated from normal data traffic  
❌ To ensure that voice and data traffic are combined on the same network  
❌ To disable all data traffic except for VoIP communication  
❌ To prioritize video traffic over voice traffic  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Combined on the same network** defeats the purpose of VLAN tagging—VoIP traffic is *segregated* for quality and security.  
- ❌ **Disabling all data except VoIP** is impractical. VoIP shares networks but is logically isolated.  
- ❌ **Prioritize video over voice** is unrelated. VLAN tagging is about segregation; QoS (Quality of Service) prioritizes traffic.

🧱 VLAN tagging lets switches identify and handle VoIP traffic distinctly—improving call quality, security, and traffic control.

# QUESTION 10  
How do VoIP phones distinguish data traffic from voice traffic?

✅ By configuring separate VLAN IDs for data and voice traffic  
❌ By using separate physical links for each type of traffic  
❌ By prioritizing voice traffic over data traffic using PoE  
❌ By using digital certificates for voice traffic only  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Separate physical links** aren't scalable or practical in modern networks—logical separation (VLANs) is preferred.  
- ❌ **PoE** provides power, not traffic classification. Prioritization is handled by QoS, not PoE.  
- ❌ **Digital certificates** are used for authentication and encryption, not for traffic classification.

🧱 VLAN tagging lets a VoIP phone assign voice traffic to a dedicated VLAN (e.g., VLAN 100 for voice, VLAN 1 for data), so switches and routers can handle each appropriately—with quality and separation.
