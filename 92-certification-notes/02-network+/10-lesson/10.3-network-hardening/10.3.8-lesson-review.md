# QUESTION 1  
How has the concept of the network edge changed due to the erosion of the perimeter security model?

- ❌ It has been eliminated entirely.  
- ✅ It has expanded to include access switches and wireless access points.  
- ❌ It has become more focused on the physical location of the network.  
- ❌ It has become synonymous with the firewall.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ The network edge hasn’t been eliminated — it’s just no longer fixed at the firewall.
- ❌ Physical location is outdated thinking; mobile/cloud blurred that line.
- ❌ Firewalls are part of the edge, but **not the entire edge** anymore.

# QUESTION 2  
What should be done to secure SNMP traffic?

- ✅ Configure SNMPv3 or use IPSec for encryption.  
- ❌ Disable SNMP entirely.  
- ❌ Use the original versions of SNMP.  
- ❌ Limit SNMP traffic to internal networks.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Disabling SNMP is overkill — we want secure **monitoring**, not no monitoring.
- ❌ Original SNMP (v1/v2) sends data unencrypted — **very insecure**.
- ❌ Limiting traffic scope helps but doesn’t **encrypt** it — defense in depth, not standalone.

# QUESTION 3  
What is the minimum recommended password length for network appliances according to the document?

- ❌ 12 characters  
- ✅ 14 characters  
- ❌ 8 characters  
- ❌ 10 characters  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ 8 characters is the **absolute minimum**, not the recommended length — way too weak now.
- ❌ 10 or 12 characters is better, but **not what the document recommended**.
- ✅ The doc specifically says: **"Passwords for network appliances should be 14+ characters."**

# QUESTION 4  
What is the perimeter security model primarily focused on?

- ❌ Encrypting data stored on the network  
- ❌ Monitoring and controlling internal network traffic  
- ✅ Preventing unauthorized external access  
- ❌ Trusting all connections within the internal network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Encryption is useful, but the **focus** of perimeter security is **boundary defense**, not data protection.
- ❌ Internal traffic monitoring is more relevant to **Zero Trust** or **Defense in Depth**.
- ❌ Trusting internal connections is a **side-effect** (and vulnerability), not the **main goal** of the model.
- ✅ The main objective is to **block threats at the perimeter** — firewalls, ACLs, etc.

🧠 Note: Trusting internal traffic is a **flaw** in the model, not its purpose. That’s why modern designs move toward **Zero Trust**.

# QUESTION 5  
What does role-based access control aim to achieve?

- ❌ Increase the number of administrators.  
- ❌ Allow all users equal access.  
- ✅ Limit permissions based on administrative roles.  
- ❌ Reduce the complexity of permissions.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ RBAC doesn’t increase admin count — it **reduces privilege sprawl**.
- ❌ Equal access is the opposite of RBAC — it enforces **least privilege**.
- ❌ It might simplify management, but that’s a side effect — the goal is **limiting access based on job role**.
- ✅ RBAC ensures users only have the permissions their **role** requires — nothing more.
