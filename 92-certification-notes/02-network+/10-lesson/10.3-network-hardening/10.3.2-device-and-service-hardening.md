## 10.3.2 – Device and Service Hardening

### 🛡️ What is Hardening?

Hardening = Securing a system by reducing its **attack surface**.  
This involves disabling unnecessary features, changing defaults, and locking down configurations.

Even devices like **switches and routers**, often thought of as "set-it-and-forget-it," run complex firmware and need protection like any host system.

### 🔐 Key Hardening Practices

#### ✅ Change Default Passwords/Credentials
- Many network devices ship with default passwords (`admin`, `password`, vendor names).
- These must be changed immediately during setup.

#### ✅ Enforce Password Complexity & Length
- Passwords for network infrastructure must resist brute force and guessing.
- **Length**:
  - Minimum: 8 characters (absolute baseline).
  - Recommended: 14+ for critical systems.
- **Complexity**:
  - Include mixed case, numbers, and symbols.
  - Even if NIST softens on complexity, many orgs still enforce it.
- **Avoid Common Passwords**:
  - `123456`, `password`, etc. are worthless.
  - Public password dumps make these exploitable.

#### ✅ Configure Role-Based Access (RBAC)
- Don’t use shared admin/root accounts.
- Assign **separate roles** for:
  - Configuring devices
  - Managing logs
  - Monitoring security
- Principle of Least Privilege: users get only the permissions they **need**.

#### ✅ Disable Unneeded Network Services
- Unused services = unused **risk**.
- Disable:
  - Remote admin interfaces (if not needed)
  - Legacy protocols
  - Anything you don’t explicitly use
- Reduces **attack surface**.

#### ✅ Disable Insecure Protocols
- Sniffing attacks rely on **unencrypted channels**.
- Replace or encapsulate:
  - Example: SNMPv1/2c → upgrade to SNMPv3 or tunnel with IPSec
- Protocols using plaintext (Telnet, FTP, HTTP) should be replaced with secure alternatives (SSH, SFTP, HTTPS).

### 🧠 Summary

Hardening isn’t glamorous — but it’s critical.  
Think of it like locking all the windows after you’ve built a fence and front door. A secure system isn’t secure by default — it’s **configured to be**.

✅ Harden **every device**, not just servers.  
✅ Apply policies **early** (during setup).  
✅ Revisit configs **regularly**
