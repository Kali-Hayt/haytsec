## Misconfigured Firewall and ACL Issues

A poorly configured firewall or ACL can introduce **network access failures** and **security vulnerabilities**. These errors typically fall into 3 categories:

---

### ❌ Access Denied Issues

- 🔒 Legitimate traffic is **blocked** when it should be allowed.
- Common causes:
  - Required **TCP/UDP ports** are blocked
  - Host or IP **address ranges** denied
  - **Application-level filters** (based on users, processes, groups) misconfigured
- 🛠️ Diagnosis Tip:
  - Try connecting **from inside and outside** the firewall.
  - If outside succeeds but inside fails → firewall likely the culprit.

---

### 🔁 Multiple Firewall Issues

- 🔄 **Network-based** and **host-based firewalls** might conflict.
  - Ex: Network ACL allows traffic, but **host firewall** blocks it.
- 🔍 Troubleshooting:
  - Temporarily **disable host firewall** to isolate.
  - Use **logs** to identify which rules are blocking traffic.
  - Investigate ACLs if traffic is blocked before hitting the host.

### 🚨 Security Violation Issues

- 💀 The most dangerous: firewall **allows traffic** that **should be blocked**.
- Why it’s bad:
  - Opens door to **exploits, malware, unauthorized access**
  - Often **goes unnoticed** (no app breakage = no alerts)
- 🛡️ Mitigation:
  - **Audit firewall rules regularly**
  - Use **change control** for every ACL/firewall config change
  - Enforce **default-deny policies** and log all exceptions

| Issue Type            | Symptom                          | Risk Level | Troubleshooting Tip                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Access Denied         | Legit traffic fails to connect  | Medium     | Test from multiple sources               |
| Multiple Firewall     | Conflicting host vs network rules | Medium     | Disable host firewall; check logs        |
| Security Violation    | Malicious traffic gets through   | High       | Requires audit, not troubleshooting      |
