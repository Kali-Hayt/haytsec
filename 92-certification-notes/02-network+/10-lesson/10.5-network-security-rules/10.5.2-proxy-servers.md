## Proxy Servers

### 🧱 What Is a Proxy Server?
- Acts as an **intermediary** between a client and a destination server.
- Instead of letting traffic pass through like a firewall, the proxy:
  - **Deconstructs** the request
  - **Analyzes** and filters it
  - **Rebuilds** and forwards it
- Enables **traffic control**, **security filtering**, and **address translation** (e.g., NAT).
- Can be deployed as software, hardware, or virtual appliance.

> 🔍 Think of a proxy as a “middleman” that talks to the internet *on your behalf*, not just a filter like a firewall.

## Forward Proxies

### 📤 Purpose
- Handles **outbound** traffic from internal clients to the internet.
- Common use: web access from a private network.

### 🔍 Application Awareness
- Must understand and manipulate protocols like:
  - HTTP / HTTPS
  - FTP, SMTP (if multipurpose)
- Can inspect and modify requests/responses.

### 📦 Features
- **Caching**: speeds up web access by storing frequently accessed data.
- **Traffic control**: enforces web usage policies, blocks certain sites.
- **Security**: hides internal network structure.

### 🧾 Transparent vs Nontransparent
- **Nontransparent**: 
  - Client must be configured (proxy IP + port, often 8080).
- **Transparent / Intercepting**:
  - Proxy auto-intercepts traffic without client setup.

## Reverse Proxies

### 📥 Purpose
- Handles **inbound** traffic from the internet to internal servers.
- Clients think they’re talking directly to the application server.

### 🔐 Key Functions
- **Publishes internal services** securely (web, mail, conferencing).
- Acts as a **single point of entry** for multiple services.
- Commonly used for:
  - Web servers
  - Messaging apps
  - Email (POP/IMAP)

### 🛡 Benefits
- Offloads:
  - **TLS encryption/decryption**
  - **Authentication**
- Improves performance:
  - **Caching**
  - **Load balancing** across server pools
