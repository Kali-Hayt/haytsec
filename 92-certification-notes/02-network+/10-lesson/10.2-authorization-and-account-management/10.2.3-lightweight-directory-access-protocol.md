## 10.2.3 – Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

### 🧱 Directory Services

- Used to **implement privilege management and authorization** in enterprise networks.
- Work like a **database of user and resource info**: usernames, groups, permissions, etc.

---

### ✅ How Access Works with Directory Services

1. **User logs in** → server generates an **access key** with:
   - Username
   - Group membership
2. When the user tries to access a resource:
   - Server matches info in access key with entries in the **Access Control List (ACL)**
   - Determines **access privileges**

---

### 🧱 What is a Directory?

- Think of it like a **database**:
  - Each **object** = a **record**
  - Each object has **attributes** (fields)
- Based on the **X.500 standard**
  - But X.500 is complex, so most use a simpler protocol: **LDAP**

---

## ✅ What is LDAP?

- **LDAP** = Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
- It’s **not a directory**, but a **protocol** used to **query/update** directory data
- Lets systems **interact with X.500-like directories**
- Common in:
  - 🪟 Windows Active Directory
  - 🐧 Linux-based authentication
- LDAP uses:
  - **TCP/UDP port 389** by default
  - TLS-secured version = **LDAPS (TCP 636)** 🔐

---

### 🧱 Distinguished Names (DN)

- Each object in X.500 has a unique **Distinguished Name (DN)**  
- DN = **attribute=value pairs**, most specific first → broadest last

#### 🔍 Example DN:
```
CN=WIDGETWEB, OU=Marketing, O=Widget, L=London, ST=London, C=UK, DC=widget, DC=example
```

- `CN` = Common Name (object, like a server)
- `OU` = Organizational Unit
- `O` = Organization
- `L/ST/C` = Location info
- `DC` = Domain Component

> Think of the DN like a **full mailing address** in reverse — most specific item (person) first, domain last.

---

### ✅ Directory Schema

- Defines:
  - Required/optional attributes
  - Object types (users, devices, services, etc.)
- Ensures consistency across directory data

---

## 💡 Summary

- LDAP is the **protocol** used to interact with directory services
- Directories store **user identities and access rights**
- **DNs** uniquely identify each object
- **Schemas** define what kind of info the directory can hold
