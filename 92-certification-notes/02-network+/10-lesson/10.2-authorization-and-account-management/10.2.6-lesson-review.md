# QUESTION 1  
Why should anonymous and simple bind access methods be disabled on an LDAP server requiring secure access?

✅ They transmit data in plaintext.  
❌ They are the most secure methods of authentication.  
❌ They provide encryption automatically.  
❌ They use digital certificates for all connections.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **They are the most secure methods of authentication**: This is false. Simple bind is the *least* secure method—it sends credentials in cleartext.
- ❌ **They provide encryption automatically**: Simple bind does *not* encrypt anything by default. Encryption must be added manually via STARTTLS or LDAPS.
- ❌ **They use digital certificates for all connections**: That’s LDAPS, not simple bind. Simple bind uses plaintext over port 389 unless secured separately.

# QUESTION 2  
What role does separation of duties play in PAM?

✅ It divides responsibilities among individuals to prevent abuse of power.  
❌ It ensures all users have the same level of access.  
❌ It allows users to choose their responsibilities.  
❌ It consolidates duties to streamline management.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It ensures all users have the same level of access**: PAM doesn’t aim for equal access — it enforces **restricted, role-based** access based on job functions.
- ❌ **It allows users to choose their responsibilities**: That would be chaos. PAM is about **centralized control**, not self-selection.
- ❌ **It consolidates duties to streamline management**: This is the opposite of what separation of duties is for. It **splits roles intentionally** to reduce the risk of internal abuse or fraud.

# QUESTION 3  
What is LDAP primarily used for?

✅ Querying and updating directory services  
❌ Transferring files between computers  
❌ Encrypting data transmissions over the Internet  
❌ Managing network devices and configurations

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Transferring files between computers**: That’s more in the territory of FTP, SMB, or SCP — LDAP doesn’t move files.
- ❌ **Encrypting data transmissions over the Internet**: LDAP itself doesn’t encrypt anything by default. You need LDAPS or STARTTLS for that.
- ❌ **Managing network devices and configurations**: That’s done via SNMP, RADIUS, or other config tools — not LDAP.

# QUESTION 4  
In an LDAP distinguished name (DN), how are the components of the name structured?

✅ As a series of attribute=value pairs  
❌ As a list of user-defined keywords  
❌ Through a sequence of encrypted tokens  
❌ In a hierarchical tree structure

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **As a list of user-defined keywords**: DN components are not arbitrary — they follow a strict attribute=value syntax.
- ❌ **Through a sequence of encrypted tokens**: DN strings are not encrypted; they're readable identifiers used in directory queries.
- ❌ **In a hierarchical tree structure**: LDAP directories *are* tree-structured, but a **DN is a flat string representation** of the object’s location using attribute=value pairs.

# QUESTION 5  
How does RBAC differ from using security groups for assigning permissions?

✅ RBAC focuses on job roles, while security groups are about user identity.  
❌ RBAC is discretionary, while security groups are nondiscretionary.  
❌ Security groups encrypt data, while RBAC does not.  
❌ RBAC assigns permissions directly to users, while security groups do not.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **RBAC is discretionary...**: It’s actually the other way around. **Security groups are discretionary**, assigned by admins. **RBAC is nondiscretionary**, enforced by role.
- ❌ **Security groups encrypt data...**: Security groups have **nothing to do with encryption**. They organize users, not data flow.
- ❌ **RBAC assigns permissions directly to users...**: RBAC assigns permissions to **roles**, not users directly. That’s the whole point of the model.

# QUESTION 6  
What does an access key contain when generated by the server's security service for an authenticated user?

✅ The user's username and group memberships  
❌ The user's password and login time  
❌ The user's browsing history and application usage  
❌ The IP address and MAC address of the user's device

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The user's password and login time**: Passwords are never stored in access keys; login time may be logged elsewhere but isn’t part of the key.
- ❌ **The user's browsing history and application usage**: That’s not tracked by access keys — it's outside the scope of directory services.
- ❌ **The IP address and MAC address of the user's device**: Those are network-layer details, not part of LDAP or access control mechanisms.

# QUESTION 7  
What does the principle of least privilege entail in the context of PAM?

✅ Granting users only the rights necessary to perform their job  
❌ Providing all users with administrative privileges  
❌ Granting users unlimited rights to perform their job  
❌ Allowing users to determine their access rights

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Providing all users with administrative privileges**: This introduces massive risk and completely violates least privilege.
- ❌ **Granting users unlimited rights to perform their job**: This goes against the core idea — **only what’s needed**, not everything possible.
- ❌ **Allowing users to determine their access rights**: Users should never assign their own permissions — that’s how you get insider threats.

# QUESTION 8  
What is the primary purpose of authorization in network systems?

✅ To allocate rights and permissions  
❌ To monitor network traffic  
❌ To encrypt data  
❌ To authenticate user identities

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To monitor network traffic**: That’s the job of IDS/IPS or network monitoring tools — not part of the authorization process.
- ❌ **To encrypt data**: Encryption is a separate function handled by protocols like TLS or IPsec — not tied to authorization directly.
- ❌ **To authenticate user identities**: That’s authentication, not authorization. AuthN = *who you are*; AuthZ = *what you're allowed to do*.

# QUESTION 9  
Which of the following statements BEST describes a key principle of the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model?

✅ Every resource has an owner.  
❌ Permissions are centrally managed by a security administrator.  
❌ Access permissions are assigned based on the sensitivity of the data.  
❌ Users are assigned roles based on their job functions.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Permissions are centrally managed...**: That’s Mandatory Access Control (MAC), not DAC. DAC is owner-controlled.
- ❌ **Access permissions are assigned based on the sensitivity of the data**: That describes **MAC**, not DAC.
- ❌ **Users are assigned roles based on their job functions**: That’s **RBAC** — Role-Based Access Control, not DAC.

# QUESTION 10  
Which of the following best describes the purpose of an access control policy in LDAP?

✅ To specify which users can access the LDAP directory.  
❌ To determine the encryption method used for LDAP communications.  
❌ To set the network ports that LDAP will use for communications.  
❌ To configure the digital certificates for LDAPS.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To determine the encryption method used for LDAP communications**: That’s configured at the protocol or transport layer (e.g., STARTTLS or LDAPS), not by access control policy.
- ❌ **To set the network ports that LDAP will use for communications**: LDAP ports (389, 636) are fixed and configured at the service/network level — not via access policy.
- ❌ **To configure the digital certificates for LDAPS**: Certificate configuration is part of TLS setup, not the access control system.
