## 10.4.8 – Port Mirroring

### 🧱 What Is Port Mirroring?

Normally, a switch forwards **unicast traffic** only to its destination port, preventing packet sniffing across the network.

However, when network monitoring or traffic analysis is needed, **port mirroring** enables packet visibility.

---

### 🔍 Definition

- **Port Mirroring** (aka **SPAN** on Cisco devices):
  - Copies all packets from one or more source ports
  - Sends them to a **designated mirror port** for analysis
  - Allows observation of traffic **without disrupting** its flow

---

### 🧰 Use Cases

- **Network analyzers** (e.g., Wireshark)
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
- **Packet sniffers**
- **Monitoring tools** (e.g., SolarWinds, PRTG)

Can be configured to capture:
- **Ingress** (incoming) traffic  
- **Egress** (outgoing) traffic  
- Or **both**

> ✅ Optional: Use filters (by protocol, TCP/UDP port) to avoid overwhelming the mirror system.

### ⚠️ Caution: Resource Impact

> 🧠 **Port mirroring is resource intensive**  
> - Can overload switch CPU
> - May cause the switch to **crash under heavy load**
> - **Always test** in lab conditions before using in production

### 🧠 Summary

| Feature            | Purpose                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Port Mirroring     | Copy traffic for inspection         |
| SPAN (Cisco term)  | Switched Port Analyzer              |
| Mirror Port Usage  | Sniffers, IDS, traffic analyzers    |
| Risk               | High CPU usage; test before deploy  |
