## 10.4.1 – Network Access Control and Port Security

### 🧱 Network Access Control (NAC)

- NAC is a system that authenticates endpoints **before** they fully connect to a network.
- Designed to **mitigate risks from rogue devices and services**.
- Basic implementation: configure **port security mechanisms**.

---

### ✅ Disable Unneeded Switch Ports

- Physical switch port access should be limited to **authorized staff**.
- Place hardware in **secure/lockable server rooms**.
- ⚠️ Wall ports in open workspaces are vulnerable to:
  - Rogue admins
  - Physical theft of room keys
- Mitigation methods:
  - Use management software to **disable unused ports**.
  - Isolate to **sinkhole VLAN** (no route to network).
  - **Cisco command:** use `switchport` commands.
  - 🔌 Alternative: **physically remove patch cable**.

> ❌ Limitation: Still vulnerable if attacker unplugs legit device and connects their own.  
> ❌ Overhead: Manually disabling adds admin complexity.

### ✅ MAC Filtering

- Define which **MAC addresses are allowed** on a port.
- Methods:
  - Create **static list** of approved MACs.
  - Set **limit** to how many MACs can connect.
- 🧠 **Sticky MACs**:
  - First allowed MACs are dynamically learned.
  - Dropped if unused for a certain time.

#### 🚨 Violation Triggers

If a device connects with an unauthorized MAC:
- The port enters a **violation state**.
