## 10.1.8 Remote Authentication

Remote authentication occurs when login requests are made **across the network** to a **remote server** rather than the local device.

> 🔐 You're logging in *from* your machine *to* another—over the network.

### 🖥️ Common Scenarios

1. **Cloud/VPN Authentication**
   - Example: logging into AWS or a remote desktop via VPN
   - You connect to a perimeter remote access server

2. **Private Network Device Management**
   - Admins use **SSH** or **RDP** to manage:
     - Switches
     - Routers
     - Servers
   - Must target systems running SSH or RDP services

---

### 🧱 Local vs Remote Authentication

- **Local auth** = session starts *on* the system you’re using
- **Remote auth** = session starts *on a remote system*, triggered *by your system*

---

### 🧱 Remote Authentication Risks

- Remote servers may store credentials (bad if exposed at the network edge)
- Syncing across multiple access servers is **hard**
- Solution? Use **AAA architecture** (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)

## 🔁 AAA Architecture (Remote Access Model)

### 1. **Supplicant**
- The device requesting access (e.g., a laptop)

### 2. **NAS / NAP**
- **Network Access Server** or **Network Access Point**
- Acts as the gateway or edge device:
  - Switches, access points, VPN concentrators
- Also called **AAA clients**

### 3. **AAA Server**
- Authenticates users and manages credentials
- Interfaces with a directory service (like AD or LDAP)
- Issues **SSO authorizations**
- Two main types:
  - **RADIUS**
  - **TACACS+**

---

## 🔐 RADIUS: Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service

- Most common AAA protocol (especially for VPNs)
- Uses:
  - **UDP** ports **1812 (auth)** and **1813 (accounting)**
- Shared secret + IP address is required for trust

> 🧱 Lightweight, good for end-user auth (e.g., remote workers)

---

## 🔐 TACACS+: Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus

- Cisco-developed, also widely supported
- Uses:
  - **TCP port 49** (more reliable than UDP)
- Better for:
  - Admin access to routers, switches
  - Per-command privilege control

### 🔎 TACACS+ Advantages:
- **Discreet AAA** (auth, authz, and accounting are handled separately)
- Reliable TCP-based delivery
- Easier failure detection (if server goes down)
- Ideal for command-level control (like `sudo` or `UAC`)

## 🧪 TACACS+ vs RADIUS

| Feature            | RADIUS                   | TACACS+                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Protocol           | UDP (1812/1813)          | TCP (49)                 |
| Best For           | End-user access (VPN)     | Admin device access       |
| AAA Structure      | Combined                  | Separated (modular)      |
| Encryption         | Passwords only            | Entire packet            |
| Vendor Origin      | Open Standard             | Cisco (but open-supported) |

> 🧠 TIP: Think of RADIUS as your front door lock (general entry), and TACACS+ as your vault key system (detailed, granular, internal control).
