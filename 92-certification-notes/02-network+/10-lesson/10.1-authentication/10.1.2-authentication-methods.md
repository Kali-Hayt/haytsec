## 10.1.2 Authentication Methods

Authentication confirms that a user or system is who it claims to be. It happens **after identification** and is triggered when credentials are submitted. If those credentials match what‚Äôs stored on the system‚Äîaccess is granted.

> ‚úÖ Strong authentication means **only the account holder** should be able to use that account.

### üß± What Is an Authentication Factor?

An **authentication factor** is the type of data used to verify identity. Each factor comes from a different **category of evidence**:

- **Knowledge Factor** ‚Äî Something you *know*
  - E.g., password, PIN, answer to security question
- **Ownership Factor** ‚Äî Something you *have*
  - E.g., smart card, hardware token
- **Biometric (Human) Factor** ‚Äî Something you *are*
  - E.g., fingerprint, retina, face scan
- **Behavioral Factor** ‚Äî Something you *do*
  - E.g., signature style, typing rhythm
- **Location Factor** ‚Äî Somewhere you *are*
  - E.g., GPS/geofencing (can only log in from work)
- **Time Factor** ‚Äî Somewhen you *are*
  - E.g., login allowed only during work hours

### üîê Multifactor vs. Single-Factor Authentication

**Single-factor authentication** uses only one type of credential:
- Example: just a password (knowledge factor)
- ‚ùå Easily compromised: passwords can be guessed, shared, stolen, or phished

**Multifactor authentication (MFA)** uses **two or more** *different* factor types:
- Example: smart card (ownership) + PIN (knowledge)
- ‚úÖ Stronger: attacker would need to compromise **two different technologies**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Using two *knowledge factors* (e.g., password + date of birth) is **not** MFA.

### üß± Two-Factor & Three-Factor Authentication

- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**:
  - Example: fingerprint (biometric) + password (knowledge)
  - User must *be* someone and *know* something

- **3FA (Three-Factor Authentication)**:
  - Example: smart card (have) + fingerprint (are) + PIN (know)
  - Requires presence, input, and identity‚Äîvery strong but less common

### üìã Account Lifecycle Note

- Onboarding = verify identity, issue secure credentials, assign roles
- Offboarding = revoke access, disable or delete account when role changes or user exits
- Skipping these steps = huge security risk

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è MFA is not just "more stuff." It‚Äôs about using **different categories** of proof. Think of it like locking a safe with a key, a fingerprint scanner, *and* a time lock.
