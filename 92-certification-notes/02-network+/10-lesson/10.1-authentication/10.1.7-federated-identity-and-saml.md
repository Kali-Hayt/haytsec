## 10.1.7 Federated Identity and SAML

### 🌐 What Is Federation?

**Federation** allows **different organizations** or **distinct networks** to trust each other’s identities.

> ✅ One user account can access services across multiple organizations.

#### Business Example:
- A company partners with suppliers and customers.
- Rather than create new accounts for each external user, they **federate** — trusting identities managed by other organizations.

#### Consumer Example:
- Logging into **Facebook with your Google account** (or vice versa)
- Facebook trusts Google to verify your identity

### 🧱 On-Prem vs Cloud Federation

- **On-premises**: Uses tools like **Active Directory + Kerberos**
- Works well in centralized domains but poor interoperability with modern cloud/web apps

- **Cloud/Web apps**: Use **standards-based federation protocols**
- Kerberos usually not supported by third-party or SaaS applications

## 🧾 Claims-Based Identity

Federated identity systems rely on **claims**: statements made by an **Identity Provider (IdP)** about a user.

> 🎫 “This user is authenticated, here’s their role and email.”

### 🔄 Federation Workflow (Kerberos-like Flow)

1. **Trust Relationship**:  
   Service Provider (SP) trusts Identity Provider (IdP)

2. **Access Attempt**:  
   User (Principal) tries to access a Service Provider (SP)

3. **Redirect to IdP**:  
   SP redirects user to authenticate with IdP

4. **Authentication**:  
   User logs in with IdP

5. **Claims Issued**:  
   If successful, IdP issues a **token/claim** (digitally signed)

6. **Present Claim**:  
   User gives claim to SP, which validates the signature

7. **Access Granted**:  
   SP grants access based on the trusted claim

## 🔐 What Is SAML?

**SAML = Security Assertion Markup Language**

- XML-based
- Used to exchange **authentication and authorization data** between:
  - **Identity Providers (IdPs)**  
  - **Service Providers (SPs)**

> ⚙️ SP = “Relying Party” in SAML terms

### Key Features:
- Claims = **SAML assertions**
- Sent via HTTP(S) using SOAP or POST binding
- Digitally signed = **trustable**
- Enables **SSO across services**

---

### 💡 SAML in Real Life

- **AWS + SAML**:
  - AWS = Service Provider
  - Your company’s IdP (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) manages identities
  - Users get AWS access without AWS-local accounts

> 🔍 Other federated protocols:
- **OAuth2.0/OpenID Connect** (used for APIs and social login)
- Use different terminology but similar flow
