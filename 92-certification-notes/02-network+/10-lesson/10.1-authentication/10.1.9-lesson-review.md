# QUESTION 1  
What framework does Windows use to provide Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication?

❌ OAuth  
✅ Kerberos  
❌ SAML  
❌ LDAP  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **OAuth** – Authorization protocol, not built for SSO in Windows environments.
- ❌ **SAML** – Common for web-based SSO (especially in cloud apps), not native to Windows domains.
- ❌ **LDAP** – A directory protocol (used for looking up credentials), not an authentication *framework*.

# QUESTION 2  
What does the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) provide in the Kerberos authentication process?

❌ Authentication for user logon requests  
❌ Immediate access to all network resources  
❌ A token that grants access to a target application server  
✅ The ability to request Service Tickets from the TGS  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Authentication for user logon requests** – That’s handled by the Authentication Service (AS), *before* the TGT is issued.
- ❌ **Immediate access to all network resources** – Access requires individual Service Tickets, not just the TGT.
- ❌ **A token that grants access to a target application server** – That’s a **Service Ticket**, not the TGT.

# QUESTION 3  
What is the preferred system for Windows network authentication?

❌ OAuth  
✅ Kerberos  
❌ SAML  
❌ NT LAN Manager (NTLM)  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **OAuth** – Used for web app authorization, not Windows authentication.
- ❌ **SAML** – Used in federated identity systems, not native to Windows network auth.
- ❌ **NTLM** – Older Windows authentication protocol, deprecated in favor of Kerberos due to security weaknesses.

# QUESTION 4  
What is the main goal of storing encryption keys securely?

❌ To facilitate key revocation  
❌ To ensure easy access for all users  
✅ To prevent unauthorized access  
❌ To increase the key's strength  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To facilitate key revocation** – Revocation is a separate process triggered if the key is compromised, not the goal of secure storage.
- ❌ **To ensure easy access for all users** – That would weaken security. Keys should be restricted to authorized users only.
- ❌ **To increase the key's strength** – Key strength is determined during generation, not storage.
---
# QUESTION 5  
What is a mandatory model in authorization?

❌ A model based on the subject's attributes  
✅ A model where rights are predetermined by system-enforced rules  
❌ A model where rights are allocated by the system administrator  
❌ A model based on the subject's role  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A model based on the subject's attributes** – That's Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), not Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
- ❌ **A model where rights are allocated by the system administrator** – That describes Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
- ❌ **A model based on the subject's role** – That’s Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), not mandatory. MAC doesn't care about roles or discretion; it's enforced by policy and labels.

# QUESTION 6  
What is considered a knowledge factor in authentication?

❌ A smart card  
❌ A fingerprint  
✅ A password  
❌ A mobile device  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A smart card** – That’s a *possession* factor (something you have).
- ❌ **A fingerprint** – That’s a *biometric* factor (something you are).
- ❌ **A mobile device** – Also a *possession* factor. Might deliver codes, but it's still "something you have".
---
# QUESTION 7  
What is a key component of federated identity management?

✅ Claims-based identity  
❌ Password synchronization  
❌ Active Directory  
❌ Single sign-on with a single password for all accounts  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Password synchronization** – That’s more of a workaround than a federated solution; true federation doesn't require synced passwords.
- ❌ **Active Directory** – It’s an identity provider, but not a *key component* of federation by itself. It needs federation protocols to play.
- ❌ **Single sign-on with a single password for all accounts** – That’s just SSO, not federation. Federation *links* identities across domains, not merge them.

🧱 Claims-based identity is the backbone of SAML, WS-Fed, and OAuth federation systems.

# QUESTION 8  
Why are behavioral, location, and time factors not reliable enough to be used as single factors in authentication?

✅ They are not specific or reliable enough.  
❌ They are too easy to fake.  
❌ They are not recognized by authentication systems.  
❌ They are too difficult to measure.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **They are too easy to fake** – Some are *hard* to fake (like mouse movement patterns), but the issue is **variability**, not spoofing.
- ❌ **They are not recognized by authentication systems** – Modern adaptive systems absolutely recognize and use them (risk-based auth, anyone?).
- ❌ **They are too difficult to measure** – Not really. Measurement tech exists. The challenge is **consistency** and **uniqueness**.

🔍 These factors are useful *supplements* (risk scoring, MFA triggers), not standalone proofs of identity.

---
# QUESTION 9  
Which of the following is an example of a behavioral factor used in authentication?

❌ Password  
✅ Making a signature  
❌ Smart card  
❌ Fingerprint  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Password** – That’s a knowledge factor (“something you know”).
- ❌ **Smart card** – That’s a possession factor (“something you have”).
- ❌ **Fingerprint** – That’s a biometric, but it’s **physiological**, not **behavioral**.

🧠 Behavioral factors = **how** you do something: typing rhythm, mouse movement, signature dynamics. It's about *your unique habits*, not your static traits.

# QUESTION 10  
Which factor determines the type of credential a subject can use for authentication?

✅ Authentication factor  
❌ Authorization model  
❌ Accounting system  
❌ Identification process  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Authorization model** – This governs *what you're allowed to do* after authentication, not how you prove who you are.
- ❌ **Accounting system** – That’s about logging and tracking user activity. It doesn’t determine credentials.
- ❌ **Identification process** – That’s *who you say you are*, not *how you prove it*. Authentication comes *after* identification.

🧱 Authentication factors include:
- Something you **know** (password)
- Something you **have** (smart card)
- Something you **are** (biometrics)
- Something you **do** (behavior)
- Somewhere you **are** (location)

And those determine *what type of credential* is used.

# QUESTION 11  
What is the role of a Certificate Authority (CA) in PKI?

✅ To guarantee the validity of digital certificates  
❌ To generate symmetric session keys  
❌ To distribute private keys to users  
❌ To encrypt messages with public keys  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To generate symmetric session keys** – That’s handled by systems doing encryption (e.g., TLS), not the CA.
- ❌ **To distribute private keys to users** – Private keys are generated and stored securely *by the user* or their local system—CAs never touch them.
- ❌ **To encrypt messages with public keys** – Anyone can use public keys to encrypt; the CA’s role is to validate that a public key *belongs* to someone (via a cert).

🧱 Think of a CA as the notary of the digital world:  
It signs digital certificates to *verify identity + public key pairings*.

# QUESTION 12  
What is a key difference between RADIUS and TACACS+ in terms of protocol functionality?

✅ TACACS+ separates AAA functions, while RADIUS does not.  
❌ TACACS+ is only used for wireless access, while RADIUS is not.  
❌ RADIUS encrypts the entire authentication process, while TACACS+ does not.  
❌ TACACS+ uses UDP for communication, while RADIUS uses TCP.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **TACACS+ is only used for wireless access** – Completely false. TACACS+ is mostly used for administrative access to routers/switches—not wireless.
- ❌ **RADIUS encrypts the entire authentication process** – Nope. RADIUS only encrypts the password field; TACACS+ encrypts *everything*.
- ❌ **TACACS+ uses UDP, while RADIUS uses TCP** – This is backwards. TACACS+ uses TCP (port 49), RADIUS uses UDP (ports 1812/1813).

🧱 AAA Separation:  
TACACS+ = AuthN + AuthZ + Accounting handled *independently* → More granular control.  
RADIUS = Bundled approach → Less flexible for command-level authorizations.

# QUESTION 13  
Why are passwords stored as cryptographic hashes?

✅ To prevent a password from being easily compromised  
❌ To ensure passwords can be easily recovered if forgotten  
❌ To allow users to choose simpler passwords  
❌ To increase the speed of the authentication process  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Recoverable if forgotten** – Hashes are *one-way*. You can’t "reverse" them to get the original password.
- ❌ **Simpler passwords** – Quite the opposite. Stronger passwords are needed to avoid hash cracking (e.g., rainbow tables).
- ❌ **Speed of authentication** – Cryptographic hashing can *slow* things down slightly due to the hashing workload (especially with salting/stretching).

🧱 Bottom line:  
Hashes defend against attackers stealing readable passwords from a database. Even if a breach occurs, hashes (if done right: salted + strong algorithm) are *significantly harder* to reverse or brute-force.

# QUESTION 14  
Which of the following combinations represents two-factor authentication?

✅ Password and a smart card  
❌ Password and a user's favorite color  
❌ Password and the time of login  
❌ Two different passwords  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Favorite color** – That's just more of what-you-know (same factor as password).
- ❌ **Time of login** – Time is a context/behavioral signal, *not* a true second factor.
- ❌ **Two passwords** – Redundant use of the *same factor* ("something you know"). Still single-factor.

🧱 Two-Factor = Two *different* categories:
- **Something you know** (password)
- **Something you have** (smart card, token, phone)
- **Something you are** (biometrics)

Using two from the same category ≠ 2FA.

# QUESTION 15  
What is a key pair in public key cryptography?

✅ A set of two keys, one public and one private, used together  
❌ Two public keys used interchangeably  
❌ Two identical keys used for encryption and decryption  
❌ A set of two keys, one for signing and one for verification  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Two public keys used interchangeably** – Makes no sense. Public keys are for *distribution* only; encryption/decryption needs the private half.
- ❌ **Two identical keys** – That's symmetric cryptography, not public key (asymmetric).
- ❌ **One for signing, one for verification** – Signing *uses the private key*, and verification uses the *public key* — but they’re not different keys created separately for this. They’re still a single key pair.

🧱 Public Key Cryptography:
- Uses **asymmetric** encryption
- Public key = freely shared
- Private key = secret
- You encrypt with one, decrypt with the other (depending on the use case)
