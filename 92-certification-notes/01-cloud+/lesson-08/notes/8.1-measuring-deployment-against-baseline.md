## 🌩️ Cloud+ Lesson 8: Monitoring, Baselines & SLAs

---

### ✅ Baseline Expectations

- Before evaluating cloud performance, **define normal vs abnormal** behavior.
- Baselines help detect performance issues and **track deviations over time**.
- Use patterns to predict behavior or detect anomalies (e.g., traffic spikes).

---

### 📦 Object Tracking for Baseline Validation

- **Object** = measurable property of a cloud resource (e.g., CPU on a VM).
- **Resource** = the cloud component (server, DB, etc.).
- **Metric** = data collected about the object (e.g., memory usage).
- Monitoring stations collect this data for:
  - Alerts
  - Logs
  - Analysis

🧱 Envelope-in-box analogy:
- Object (CPU) inside → Metric (utilization %) → Collected by monitoring system

---

### 📏 What to Monitor & When

- Don’t monitor *everything*—monitor only **what matters**.
- Key examples: CPU, memory, request count, response time.
- **Frequency matters**:
  - Too infrequent = blind spots
  - Too frequent = noise & overhead
- ⚖️ Balance precision vs practicality

📌 Goal: Collect just enough data to:
- Detect performance issues
- Scale correctly
- Avoid over- or under-provisioning

---

### 🔄 Application Versions

- Always **document app versions** used during baseline measurements.
- New app versions = new baselines needed.
- Without this, comparisons become meaningless.

---

### ⚙️ CPU Usage

- Cloud apps are often **CPU-bound**.
- Most tracked metric = % CPU utilization.
- Use this for:
  - Trend detection
  - Peak analysis
  - Capacity planning
  - Troubleshooting anomalies

---

### 🔍 Audit Trails & Change Logging

- Enable **auditing** for:
  - Monitoring config changes
  - Compliance requirements (regulatory or internal)
- Helpful for detecting tampering or recovering from breaches.

🛡️ Malicious actors often try to **disable or alter monitoring** to cover tracks.
Audit logs help prove what was changed and when.

---

### 🧰 Management Tool Compliance

- Cloud vendors provide **built-in tools** (or support 3rd-party tools).
- You’re responsible for:
  - Meeting regulatory requirements
  - Ensuring tools meet audit/compliance needs

📜 Review vendor documentation to confirm compliance compatibility.

## 🌐 Network Utilization Metrics

Cloud networking isn’t just about “is it connected?”—it’s about **how well** it’s performing. These are the key metrics to monitor when ensuring your cloud’s network can handle the load and meet SLAs.

---

### 🧱 Key Metrics

- **Capacity**  
  Maximum available bandwidth end-to-end.  
  - Set by provider’s internet/backbone connections.  
  - You can’t control it directly, but **track it** for SLA and troubleshooting.

- **Jitter**  
  Variation in delay between packets.  
  - Real-time traffic killer (voice, video).  
  - Causes buffering, lag, unpredictability.  
  - ✅ Track this for any **streaming or live** apps.

- **Latency**  
  Time for a packet to reach its destination.  
  - Voice/video apps are **very sensitive** to high latency.  
  - Bulk transfer apps like file sync or email? Less so.  
  - 🔍 Think of latency as "how fast is the roundtrip?"

- **Packet Loss**  
  % of packets that never arrive.  
  - Low = normal.  
  - High = disaster for TCP apps (causes retransmissions, freezes).  
  - Shows up as glitchy audio/video, failed uploads, and retry loops.  
  - Realtime protocols adapt, but **you must monitor loss closely**.

---

### ⚠️ Why This Matters

- High network utilization = slower cloud apps, failed uploads, user frustration.
- These four metrics are **standard for SLA reviews** across any cloud deployment:
  - IaaS
  - PaaS
  - SaaS

---
## 🛠️ Patch, RAM, and Storage Monitoring

---

### 🔧 Patch Versions

- Keep all VMs **patched** as part of your cloud maintenance program.
- Track:
  - OS patch levels
  - Installed applications
  - Installed version data
- Some cloud providers offer agents or tools to automate this collection.
- 🔍 Used for **baseline tracking** and to ensure all systems are up-to-date.

---

### 🧠 RAM Usage

- **Memory usage** is a top object to monitor—if memory is near full, performance **will suffer**.
- When RAM gets tight:
  - Apps slow or crash
  - OS begins swapping
  - System may need to be **migrated to a bigger VM**
- VM upgrade is often easy but may require **downtime + reboot**.
- ✅ Important to track RAM over time for **baseline and trending**.

---

### 💽 Storage Utilization

- Cloud storage is often advertised as “unlimited”—but **you pay for what you use**.
- Monitoring lets you:
  - Avoid running out of space
  - Shift data to cheaper tiers (life-cycle storage)
  - Optimize cost
- Track how much of your disk/disk pool is in use.
- Aliases: **disk usage, storage consumption, disk space**

---
### 🧱 Baseline Validation

- Is your baseline actually valid? It must reflect reality — operations will be judged against it.
- Best method: gather baseline metrics **over time** to smooth out short-term noise (e.g., holidays, slow periods).
- Compare against similar systems or usage cases to confirm your values are reasonable.

#### 🧪 What to Compare:
- CPU
- Network
- Memory
- Storage
- Custom metrics

➡️ Goal: readings should fall within an expected range. Over time, you’ll establish a stable baseline.

---

### 🧱 Initial Testing

- Simulate **load** and **application usage** to generate baseline performance data.
- After test runs:
  - Analyze results
  - Adjust config
  - Re-run to validate changes

---

### 🧱 Post-Change Benchmark Validation

After a patch or upgrade, **revalidate** your baseline. Don’t assume it’s still valid!

🔍 Perform these 3 steps:

1. **Pre-patch/Pre-upgrade**: Snapshot current baseline metrics.
2. **Post-patch/Post-upgrade**: Measure system performance again.
3. **Compare**: Analyze the **delta** between before and after to confirm performance changes.

---
### 🧱 Unnecessary Open Ports

- **Unattended open ports** = ports that are accessible without valid purpose.
- These can reveal vulnerabilities to attackers — used for:
  - Port scanning
  - DoS attacks
  - Intrusions

---

### ✅ Best Practices

- Conduct **regular port audits** to close unneeded ports.
- Monitoring falls under:
  - IP Security Firewalls
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

🔍 **Common overused ports**:
- **Telnet** – 23
- **SMB** – 445
- **RDP** – 3389  
These ports are favorites for attackers due to remote access capabilities.

---

### 🔐 Mitigation Strategies

- Use **network segmentation** + tight firewall rules.
- Apply **PoLP** (Principle of Least Privilege):
  - Limit port access to only what’s necessary.
- Follow **NIST guidelines** for periodic port assessments.

---
### 🧱 Triage

Triage = the **prioritization and classification** of incidents, alerts, or system events by severity and impact.

- 🩺 Purpose: Address **critical issues first**, then deal with lower-priority ones.
- Helps distinguish **false positives** from **genuine threats** — improves incident response efficiency.

---

### 🤖 Automated Triage

- Uses **AI/ML** to categorize and prioritize alerts.
- Reduces manual workload ✅
- Speeds up response time ✅

🔧 Tools that support triage:
- **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management)
- **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

These tools:
- Correlate data across systems
- Help maintain or improve risk mitigation
- Support **operational resilience** through structured workflows

---
## Service Level Agreement (SLA) Attainment

### 🧱 What is an SLA?
- Defined in Lesson 2, “Cloud Deployments”
- Outlines key performance indicators (KPIs) and service guarantees from cloud providers
- SLA metrics are used to verify provider performance using actual data

---

### 📊 Who Tracks SLA Metrics?
- **Customer's responsibility** to monitor SLA attainment
- Monitoring tools help interpret raw data
  - Data often visualized in **graphs**, **tables**
  - Export formats: **Excel**, **PDF**

---

### 🔄 When SLAs Must Change
- Business needs evolve—your SLA might not keep up
- Periodic reviews are essential to ensure SLA aligns with current requirements
- If current SLA fails:
  - You may need to **renegotiate**
  - Or **upgrade** to another service class
  - Extreme case: **rearchitect your cloud environment**

---

### 📅 Regular Review Best Practices
- Review **baseline metrics** against current SLA
- Check for:
  - ❌ Missing critical metrics
  - ❌ Misaligned requirements
- Discuss changes with cloud provider as needed
- Once updated SLA is in place:
  - Adjust monitoring tools accordingly
  - Watch for **compliance gaps**, **new trends**, or **issues**

---

### ✅ Takeaways
- SLA tracking is not “set and forget”—it’s an ongoing process
- Monitoring tools translate raw data into actionable insights
- Proactive SLA management ensures your cloud services remain aligned with evolving business goals

---
## Compute Tuning

### 🧠 What It Means
- When CPU usage nears its limit, you have two core options:
  - Lower the workload on the instance CPUs
  - Add more compute resources (scale up or out)
- OS-level tools can show what processes are hogging CPU cycles
- Unnecessary services can be **disabled or shut down**

---

### ⚙️ Scaling Options

- **Vertical Scaling** (Scale Up):
  - Upgrade to a **larger instance** (more cores, faster CPUs)
  - May require downtime to change machine image
  - Adds power to one machine

- **Horizontal Scaling** (Scale Out):
  - Add more servers to share the load
  - No downtime needed
  - Adds capacity through **parallelism**

---

### ✅ Practical Guidance
- Tune your server first (optimize apps, manage services)
- If CPU use remains high → scale
- Know the tradeoff: vertical = downtime, horizontal = complexity

---

## Network Changes

### 🌐 What You Control vs. What They Control
- Networking parameters are **mostly global** (controlled by cloud provider)
- Your role: ensure network performance is within **SLA & baseline**

---

### 🏎️ High-Performance Solutions

- For **network-intensive workloads**:
  - Place servers in same **subnet** and **availability zone** to cut latency
  - Use **high-bandwidth NICs** (e.g., up to 100 Gbps)
  - Use **cluster placement groups** to keep instances physically close—sometimes even on the same host

---

### ⚠️ Pro Tip
- SLA doesn't guarantee high performance unless *you* configure properly
- Be intentional with placement, adapter selection, and topology

---

## Storage Tuning

### 📏 Monitor and Baseline
- Use baselines to verify that **storage I/O** meets performance needs
- Excessive utilization leads to **degraded disk read/write performance**
- Track **block storage systems** for I/O stats (read/write bottlenecks)

---

### 🧱 Scaling Options

- **Upgrade VM Storage Adapter**:
  - Limited by VM class — can’t pair low-end VM with high-end adapter
  - Increase bandwidth = better I/O handling

- **Select Better Storage Class**:
  - Choose tiers with higher **IOPS guarantees**
  - More IOPS = more cost, usually tied to disk size

---

### 🧠 Database Optimization
- **Read/write replica strategy**:
  - Single DB replica can be a bottleneck
  - Solution: multiple **read replicas** on different volumes
  - Load balance across them to reduce storage pressure

---

## Service/Application Changes

### 🔁 SaaS Changes (Cloud-managed)

- If using SaaS, provider handles most changes
- Updates often pushed via:
  - **Feature announcements**
  - **Maintenance notifications**
- New offerings include:
  - Enhanced DB services
  - Collaboration platforms
- You benefit by **adopting new features** without managing infrastructure

---

### 🏗️ IaaS Changes (Customer-managed)

- Services like:
  - Load balancers
  - Firewalls
  - Compute platforms
  - Block storage
- Providers update these to stay competitive
- **Not forced on you**, but:
  - You must adopt changes to benefit
  - Providers might **raise prices** on older tech to push you forward

---

### ✅ Real-World Example
- Been using magnetic disk for years?
  - Provider likely won’t auto-decommission it
  - But pricing may nudge you toward SSD-backed storage

---
## Changing Operations to Meet Expected Performance/Capacity Requirements

### 🧱 Context
- Applies mainly to **IaaS** and **PaaS** environments — not your responsibility in **SaaS**
- Performance tuning may require **dynamic scaling** to meet new or unexpected demands

---

## 🏗️ Vertical Scaling

### 📈 What It Is
- Increasing VM resources to handle heavier workloads
- Required when apps (like certain DBs) can’t scale horizontally
- Metrics monitored: CPU, memory, storage I/O, network

---

### ⚙️ Two Methods of Vertical Scaling

1. **In-place Upgrade** (Less Risky)
   - Shut down the VM
   - Upgrade to a stronger instance type (same image)
   - Restart
   - ✅ No migration or DNS/IP reconfiguration

2. **New VM Migration** (More Complex)
   - Spin up new VM with better specs
   - Migrate:
     - Storage volumes
     - Network adapters
     - ACLs and security groups
   - Replace old server with new one
   - IP can remain the same if done properly
   - ❌ Causes downtime — potentially **extensive**

---

### ⚠️ Scaling Caution

- Do **not** do vertical scaling frequently
- Use only when:
  - Absolutely necessary
  - You plan to **stick with** the upgraded VM for a while
- Too disruptive for routine use

---

### ✅ Takeaway
- Vertical scaling is powerful, but heavy-handed
- Monitor, plan, and time it right to avoid operational impact

---
## Horizontal Scaling

### 🧱 What It Is
- Adds compute power by **adding more servers**, rather than upgrading one
- Keeps existing servers running and **distributes load across new instances**
- Best for distributed, parallelizable applications (e.g., web servers, microservices)

---

## 🔄 Autoscaling Overview

### 🧠 How It Works
- Cloud orchestration tools monitor key metrics (e.g., CPU usage)
- If metrics exceed threshold (e.g., 80% CPU over 5 minutes), system **launches new VMs** from a predefined image
- New servers are:
  - Added to **load balancer groups**
  - Monitored for health
  - Removed when no longer needed (scale-in)
  - Optionally added/removed on **scheduled basis** (e.g., traffic spikes)

---

### ⚙️ What You Can Configure
- Set upper/lower limits for VM count (e.g., always keep at least 3 servers)
- Define VM instance class/type
- Configure alerts for when autoscaling triggers
- Replace failed VMs automatically

---

### ✅ Benefits
- **No manual intervention**
- Great for handling **variable or unpredictable workloads**
- Minimizes overprovisioning and costs
- Works well with **stateless apps** or services that scale horizontally

---

### ⚠️ Keep In Mind
- Requires apps to **support horizontal scaling**
- Still need to manage:
  - Load balancer configuration
  - Health checks
  - Application state (avoid stateful sessions tied to single instances)

---
