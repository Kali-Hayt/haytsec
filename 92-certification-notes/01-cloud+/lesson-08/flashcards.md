# QUESTION 1
Rhonda is creating a change management plan to increase the processing abilities of one of her middleware application servers. What component can she upgrade to increase server processing performance?

✅ CPU  
❌ Chargeback  
❌ Service level agreement  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Chargeback**: Refers to billing or cost allocation — doesn’t impact server performance.
- ❌ **Service level agreement**: Defines performance expectations but doesn’t **change** processing capability.
- ❌ **I don't know**: This is not a valid answer choice for exam prep.

# QUESTION 2
Cloud capacity consumption can be measured by comparing current usage to what?

✅ Baseline  
❌ Chargeback  
❌ Service level agreement  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Chargeback**: Refers to cost tracking, not performance or resource usage comparison.
- ❌ **Service level agreement**: Defines service expectations, not used for usage comparisons.
- ❌ **I don't know**: Always a non-answer in test prep.

# QUESTION 3
Object tracking should be aligned with which service provider document that outlines guaranteed performance metrics?

✅ Service level agreement  
❌ Autoscaling  
❌ CPU  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Autoscaling**: This is a feature for adjusting capacity, not a document or guarantee.
- ❌ **CPU**: It's a component, not a contractual metric document.
- ❌ **I don't know**: Not acceptable in test prep — aim to understand the key documents.

# QUESTION 4
Carl works in accounting and wants to allocate intracompany billing for cloud services that different departments consume. What billing model is he implementing?

✅ Chargeback  
❌ Autoscaling  
❌ Service level agreement  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Autoscaling**: Manages compute capacity, not financial tracking or billing.
- ❌ **Service level agreement**: Defines service metrics, not cost allocation models.
- ❌ **I don't know**: Not an acceptable choice for test success.
---
# QUESTION 5
In what two formats are cloud-based reports generally presented?

✅ PDF and Microsoft Excel  
❌ Autoscaling  
❌ Service level agreement  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Autoscaling**: That’s a resource management feature, not a report format.
- ❌ **Service level agreement**: It’s a document describing guarantees, not a reporting format.
- ❌ **I don't know**: You do now — it’s PDF and Excel, the go-to formats for exports.

# QUESTION 6
Jeff wants to use the automation capabilities of the public cloud to automatically add servers when there is a usage spike. What is the cloud service that automates this process?

✅ Autoscaling  
❌ Chargeback  
❌ PDF and Microsoft Excel  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Chargeback**: Used for billing, not capacity automation.
- ❌ **PDF and Microsoft Excel**: These are report formats, not automation tools.
- ❌ **I don't know**: Not a winning strategy — you’ve got this now.
