### 🧱 9.3 Troubleshooting Automation and Orchestration

In cloud environments, automation and orchestration tools may be partially out of your control.

- These systems are often managed by the cloud provider  
- In public cloud, your access is limited by the shared responsibility model  
- You typically only control:
  - 🧩 Templates (e.g., CloudFormation, ARM)
  - ⚙️ Configuration items you are granted access to

---

### ✅ How to Troubleshoot These Systems

- Compare the **input** (what you submitted) to the **output** (what was deployed)  
- This helps verify:
  - 🎯 Did the automation tool deliver what was expected?
  - 🛠️ Were config items or resources missing, skipped, or failed?

---

### 🛟 When Things Go Wrong

- If you're stuck:
  - Open a support ticket with the cloud provider  
  - Collaborate with internal DevOps teams  
- Issues seen by one user are often seen by others:
  - Check support forums, bug reports, and discussion threads  
  - Contribute to shared troubleshooting and community fixes

---

### 🧠 Pro Tip

- Automation bugs can be tricky — what looks like a broken system may just be a bad variable  
- Always test templates and scripts in sandbox environments first

---
### 🧱 Process and Workflow Issues: Account Mismatch

Many cloud problems stem from broken processes — especially in identity and access configuration.

- Accounts = users and groups defined in the cloud management console  
- Users can be:
  - Assigned to groups (e.g., storage admins, developers)  
  - Given direct access rights  

- A mismatch happens when:
  - ✅ A user’s privileges don’t match what the job needs  
  - ❌ Approvals aren’t in place  
  - 🔐 Access is misconfigured in IAM or RBAC policies

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps

- Identify what access the user or group is supposed to have  
- Compare that to what’s configured in the cloud IAM console  
- Validate that:
  - Group roles are correct  
  - Users are in the right group  
  - Assigned permissions match job functions  
  - All approvals and change controls were completed

---

### 🧠 Admin Best Practices

- Use the account management policy to define:
  - How accounts are created, approved, and deleted  
  - How access is assigned and monitored  
- Audit account activity regularly to detect:
  - Privilege creep  
  - Misuse  
  - Unauthorized changes  
---

### 🧱 Process and Workflow Issues: Change Management Breakdowns

Change management failures often result from poor coordination between teams.

- Example:  
  - Server team installs patches  
  - Network team schedules downtime at the same time  
  - ❌ Server team can’t complete work because network is down  

- These breakdowns expose:
  - 🔁 Hidden dependencies  
  - ❌ Lack of communication  
  - 🧱 No centralized scheduling  

---

### ✅ What Proper Change Management Requires

- A written change management plan  
- Coordination across all involved teams  
- Change review meetings to:
  - Discuss impact  
  - Identify dependencies  
  - Schedule without overlap  

---
### 🛟 During the Change Window

- Teams must be ready to react if something fails  
- Example:  
  - Server upgrade begins  
  - Network goes down  
  - 🔄 Rollback plan must be in place  

- Always include:
  - Contingency actions  
  - Communication protocols  
  - Post-change reviews to document what went wrong and how to prevent recurrence  

---
### 🧱 Process and Workflow Issues: DNS and Server Name Changes

DNS translates human-readable names into IP addresses — like a phonebook for the internet.

- If a server’s IP address changes:
  - 📡 You must update the DNS record  
  - 🧭 Otherwise, services won’t know where to find it  
- Common triggers for DNS updates:
  - New load balancer  
  - Server migration  
  - IP reassignment in cloud environments

---

### ⚠️ What Can Go Wrong

- Most services rely on domain names, not static IPs  
- If DNS entries are wrong or missing:
  - ❌ The service becomes unreachable  
  - 🕒 You’ll see timeouts or failed connection attempts  
- Always consider DNS misconfiguration when troubleshooting connectivity issues  

---

### 🛠️ Use nslookup for DNS Troubleshooting

- `nslookup` lets you query a DNS server directly  
- Returns either:
  - ✅ The correct IP address  
  - ❌ An error if no record exists  
- Helps identify:
  - Whether DNS records exist  
  - If the returned info matches your intended configuration  

---

### 🧱 Process and Workflow Issues: Version Incompatibility

Software updates can break things — especially when components don't play well together after a patch.

- Common scenario:
  - ✅ System works fine one day  
  - ❌ Overnight patch or upgrade breaks functionality  
- Incompatibility can be introduced by:
  - OS patches  
  - App or driver updates  
  - Cloud service version changes  

---

### 🛠️ How to Approach It

- Ask: "What changed since this was last working?"  
- Trace version changes across:
  - Application stacks  
  - OS dependencies  
  - Network configs and credential requirements  

- Check:
  - 🔍 Logs for errors  
  - 🔐 Policy or parameter mismatches  
  - ⚙️ Deployment scripts or build pipelines  

---

### 🧠 Tip

- Versioning conflicts are subtle and frustrating — especially across hybrid environments  
- Keep a record of known-good versions and update schedules  
- Use automated testing in staging before pushing updates to prod  

---
### 🧱 Process and Workflow Issues: IP Address Changes

Changing IP addresses is more than just editing a config — it affects multiple systems and layers.

- Must update:
  - 🧭 DNS records to reflect the new IP  
  - 🔐 ACLs that reference the old address  
  - 🔥 Firewall rules  
  - 🛣️ Network routing tables  
- All connected devices must be reviewed:
  - Servers  
  - Storage systems  
  - Any static IP interfaces  

---

### ✅ What Makes It Risky

- One missed IP reference = broken service  
- IP changes often break:
  - Monitoring tools  
  - Security policies  
  - Automated scripts  

---

### 🛠️ Mitigation Strategy

- Follow a written change management plan  
- Include:
  - Validation checks  
  - Backout steps  
  - Role assignments for testing  

- Reconfigure and test all impacted systems before declaring success  

---

### 🧱 Process and Workflow Issues: Location Changes

Moving a deployment from one location to another can be seamless — or a complex migration with downtime.

- Cloud providers often support:
  - Multiple availability zones  
  - Region-to-region failover  
  - Automated migrations in SaaS environments ✅  

- In IaaS and PaaS:
  - You are responsible for designing for resiliency  
  - Standby resources may be required in secondary regions  
  - 💸 More flexibility = more cost  

---

### ⚠️ Risks of Poor Planning

- Without proper planning, region changes can:
  - ❌ Cause unexpected downtime  
  - 💥 Break data replication  
  - 🔁 Disrupt load balancing  

- If operating in a single region:
  - You must shut down services in one region before spinning them up in another  
  - This leads to unavoidable service interruptions unless designed for high availability  

---

### 🛠️ Best Practices

- Design with regional flexibility in mind  
- Test all failover and replication setups ahead of time  
- Plan changes as formal projects:
  - With rollback steps  
  - Stakeholder coordination  
  - Pre-change validation testing  


---

### 🧱 Process and Workflow Issues: Deployment Model Change

Migrating between deployment models or providers is one of the most complex cloud changes.

- Example:  
  - Moving from an on-prem data center to a public cloud SaaS model  
  - Shifting from IaaS to SaaS or from one cloud vendor to another  

- Risks include:
  - 🧱 Rebuilding infrastructure from scratch  
  - 🔐 Re-validating identity, networking, and security  
  - 💼 Dependency mapping and data migration  

---

### ✅ What Makes the Cloud Flexible

- Public cloud lets you:
  - Spin up test environments cheaply  
  - Destroy them after validation  
  - Run trial migrations without disrupting production  
- You only pay for what you use  
- Encourages pre-deployment testing and planning  

---

### 🛠️ Best Practices for Migration

- Build and validate a test bed before go-live  
- Document every change step  
- Plan rollback procedures in case of failure  
- Include internal stakeholders for all layers:  
  - Infrastructure  
  - Application  
  - Data
