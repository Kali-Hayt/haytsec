# QUESTION 1
Sophia is monitoring her cloud web server dashboard, and she notices that CPU utilization on her company’s database server fleet has been consistently at more than 80 percent. She checked her baselines and noticed that 60 percent utilization is normal. What is the difference called?

✅ Variance  
❌ NTP  
❌ Default gateway  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ NTP: Network Time Protocol deals with clock synchronization, not performance metrics or utilization.
- ❌ Default gateway: Refers to a network routing setting, unrelated to CPU usage.
- ❌ I don't know: Not a valid answer—variance is the known term for deviation from baseline.

# QUESTION 2
During configuration of a network interface, what is the term for the router on the connected subnet that is required to reach other subnets?

✅ Default gateway  
❌ Variance  
❌ NTP  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Variance: Refers to deviation from a baseline, unrelated to networking routes.
- ❌ NTP: Network Time Protocol is for synchronizing clocks, not routing.
- ❌ I don't know: Not helpful. The correct term is "default gateway," which is the exit point from a subnet to reach others.

# QUESTION 3
True or false? An incident is any event that threatens to interrupt your normal operations.

✅ True  
❌ NTP  
❌ Default gateway  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ NTP: Network Time Protocol keeps system clocks in sync. It has nothing to do with identifying incidents.
- ❌ Default gateway: Refers to routing traffic between networks, not incident classification.
- ❌ I don't know: Not helpful. An incident is, by definition, anything that could disrupt operations—true is the correct answer.

# QUESTION 4
What network service provides accurate time synchronization information?

✅ NTP  
❌ Variance  
❌ Default gateway  
❌ I don't know  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Variance: This refers to deviation from a baseline, not a time sync service.
- ❌ Default gateway: It's a routing concept that sends traffic out of a subnet—not related to time.
- ❌ I don't know: Not knowing won’t get your logs lined up—NTP will.
