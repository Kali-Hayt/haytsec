# Scenario

Your organization, a rapidly growing e-commerce platform experiencing significant seasonal traffic variations, has successfully migrated a substantial portion of its workloads (including its primary customer-facing application, product catalog, and order processing systems) to a major public cloud provider. While the migration has brought agility, management is now heavily focused on optimizing the escalating cloud spend. You, as a senior cloud engineer, are tasked with leading the initiative to identify and implement significant cost-saving measures. You are aware that some of the most effective cost-saving techniques—such as aggressively utilizing spot instances for stateless application tiers, implementing predictive auto-scaling based on forecasted demand, dynamically rightsizing compute and database resources, and transitioning colder data to lower-cost archival storage tiers—could potentially impact application performance during unexpected surges, affect data retrieval times, or introduce complexities in maintaining Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

**Part I**

**1. Principles, Tools, and Techniques**

**Getting Started (Principles):** Imagine your family wants to save money on monthly bills (like electricity or groceries). What general steps would you take to figure out where you're spending and where you could cut back? How might a company do something similar for its cloud computing costs? What does it mean to create a "cost-aware culture" in this context?

**Getting Started (Tools & AI):** If you were trying to manage these cloud costs, what kind of information or tools would you want from the cloud provider? How do you think 'smart' programs or AI could help a company find ways to save cloud costs automatically or predict future bills?

**Getting Started (Risks of Techniques):** The scenario mentions "spot instances" as a cheaper option that is not always guaranteed to be available. If this e-commerce company used these for parts of its website, what potential problems or risks could arise for customers trying to shop, especially during a big sale? Think about one other technique mentioned (like "archival storage") and a potential downside.

**Deeper Dive:** Beyond general principles like "pay-as-you-go," what specific FinOps principles and practices would you champion? What categories and specific examples of cloud provider tools and/or third-party FinOps platforms would you employ? How can AI/ML-powered features enhance your optimization efforts? For the aggressive cost-saving techniques mentioned, analyze the _specific risks_ each poses to an e-commerce platform's performance, reliability, and user experience.

**2. Balancing Cost, Performance, and SLAs**

**Getting Started:** Think about your own phone or internet service. You want it to be fast and always working (performance/availability), but you also don't want to pay too much. How do you personally decide what is 'good enough' performance for the price you pay? How is this similar to the e-commerce company in the scenario trying to balance its website's performance (defined by SLAs) with saving money? Is it always better to pay more for guaranteed top performance, or are there times when "good enough" is okay if it saves a lot?

**Getting Started (Metrics):** Besides just "dollars saved," what other ways could the company measure if its cost-saving efforts are truly successful without negatively impacting its business or customers? (e.g., are customers complaining more? Is the website slower?)

**Deeper Dive:** How would you develop a framework for balancing the executive drive for aggressive cost savings with the non-negotiable need for adequate application performance and availability, as defined by existing SLAs? What role does defining the organization's risk appetite play? Instead of a simple choice between over-provisioning and aggressive optimization, propose a spectrum of strategic approaches or a phased optimization plan. How should monitoring, alerting, and automated rollback strategies be adapted? What specific metrics or KPIs, beyond direct dollar savings, would you implement?

**Part II**

**1. Ethical Reporting of Risk-Laden Savings**

**Getting Started:** As an engineer, if you found a way for your company to save a lot of money, but it meant there was a very, very small chance of losing some old company records that are considered "non-critical" (not essential for daily operations), what would you feel is the right thing to do? Who in the company should you tell, and what key information should you make sure they understand?

**Getting Started (Defining "Non-Critical"):** Who in a company do you think should have the authority to decide if certain data or information is "non-critical"? What problems could arise if the company gets this definition wrong, or if data they thought was unimportant later turns out to be needed?

**Deeper Dive:** What is your precise ethical obligation as a cloud engineer in reporting a measure with potential data loss risk (even if slight and for "non-critical" data) to management? Who should define "non-critical data," and what are the ethical implications if this definition is flawed or if the data's perceived criticality changes over time?

**2. Weighing User Impact vs. Financial Benefit**

**Getting Started:** Imagine a cost-saving change means that if you call customer service about an old order, it takes them an extra 30 seconds to pull up your information because it is stored in a slower, cheaper system. As a customer, would this slight delay bother you? How much of a delay would be "too much," even if it saves the company money? Who should make this decision?

**Deeper Dive:** How should the potential user impact (e.g., slower access to historical order details, slightly delayed personalized recommendations) be quantitatively and qualitatively weighed against the direct financial benefit of such a cost-saving measure? Propose an ethical framework or a series of steps for evaluating, documenting, and communicating such risk-laden cost-saving measures to relevant stakeholders. This should include how you would ensure transparency. When, if ever, could implementing such a change without explicit broader notification be justified, and what are the inherent dangers?

## My-Final-Discussion-Post

In cloud computing, every little thing adds up. Whether it is compute power, storage, or bandwidth, it all costs money. If a company wants to reduce its cloud bill, it cannot keep every tool or feature just because it is convenient. It reminds me of personal budgeting. If you are saving for something big like a house, you have to change how you spend. You need to figure out what is essential and what can be adjusted or removed. For a business with seasonal traffic spikes, it makes sense to keep the most important parts of the system, like the main website, running at full speed during busy periods. Meanwhile, background processes or less important features could run on cheaper setups to save money. I have been learning about cost-saving methods like spot instances and archival storage. These options can be great for reducing costs, but they come with trade-offs. Spot instances can disappear at any time, which makes them risky for anything critical. Archival storage is useful for keeping older data, but it is much slower to access when that data is needed. A smart first step would be using a tool like AWS Cost Explorer to get a clear view of where the money is going. From there, decisions can be made based on what really matters. Cost optimization is not about cutting everything. It is about making smart and balanced choices.

Finding the right balance between cost and performance is not easy. Customers expect fast and reliable service. I think about this like choosing a phone or internet plan. I may not pay for the most expensive option, but I still expect it to work well without slowing me down. Cloud services are the same. The most important functions, like the checkout process or login screen, should always perform well. This is where service level agreements help by setting clear expectations. At the same time, things like viewing past orders or loading recommendations could run slightly slower if it helps reduce cost. What matters is having good monitoring in place and a plan to fix problems quickly if something goes wrong. It also makes sense to track more than just cost savings. Keeping an eye on customer feedback, website speed, and system performance helps make sure that cutting costs does not harm the overall experience. Leadership should also decide how much risk is acceptable so that technical teams can make decisions with confidence.

If there is even a small chance of losing data, even if the data is considered non-critical, I would bring it up. Engineers should not be the ones deciding what is or is not important. That responsibility belongs to managers, legal staff, or compliance teams who can see the full picture. For example, storing old customer records in cold storage might seem like a simple way to save money, but if support staff cannot pull up those records quickly when someone calls, it can lead to frustration or harm the company’s reputation. I think decisions like that should consider both the financial savings and the impact on customers. I would make sure the risks, benefits, and backup plans are clearly shared with the right people. Sometimes small risks are acceptable if there is a recovery plan in place. But hiding risks just to save money can backfire. A short delay might be okay, but if customers lose trust in the service, the cost of that loss can be far greater than whatever money was saved.
