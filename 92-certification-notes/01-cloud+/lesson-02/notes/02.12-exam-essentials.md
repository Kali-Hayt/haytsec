# 2.12 Exam Essentials – Cloud+ Lesson 2 (Configuring and Deploying Storage)

---


## 🛠️ 1. Know the key concepts of creating and executing a cloud deployment
- Cloud migrations are a core exam focus.
- Understand the full **migration process**, including:
  - Preparation steps
  - Deployment phases
  - Post-deployment verification
- Know the differences between **online vs. offline** migrations.

---

## 🌐 2. Differentiate between the cloud service models
- Compare **IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**, and **XaaS**.
- Know the traits of **public, private, hybrid, and community** cloud models.
- Review how deployment models align with different **use cases and risk tolerances**.

---

## 💻 3. Understand and differentiate the technical concepts of performing a migration
- Master CPU sizing concepts:
  - Hyperthreading
  - CPU performance metrics
  - Virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x, AMD-V)
- Memory sizing concepts:
  - **Overcommitment**, **bursting**, **ballooning**
- Shared vs. dedicated hardware resources

---

## 🗃️ 4. Explain the storage technologies used in cloud computing
- Understand cloud storage types:
  - **Block, object, file**
- Know redundancy and provisioning models:
  - Thin vs. thick provisioning
  - Snapshots and backups
- Study **storage security** and **availability** best practices

---

## 🔄 5. Identify and describe how to perform workload migrations
- Know the following migration types:
  - **V2V** (Virtual-to-Virtual)
  - **P2V** (Physical-to-Virtual)
  - **V2P** (Virtual-to-Physical)
- Recognize scenarios requiring each type
- Determine when **online vs. offline** migration is best

---

## 🕸️ 6. Explain the network services used in cloud computing
- Key services to understand and identify:
  - **DNS** (Domain Name System)
  - **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
  - **TLS certificates** for encrypted traffic
  - **Load balancers** for distributing requests
  - **Firewalls** for traffic filtering
  - **IDS/IPS** (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)
- Know how each service supports availability and security

---

📌 **Pro Tip:** Read this section multiple times until you can clearly describe each technology and service — including where, when, and **why** it is used in the cloud.
