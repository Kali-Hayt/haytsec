## 📘 02.11 Summary – Cloud Storage & Security Concepts

### 🔐 **Certificate Services**

- Most cloud providers support **TLS certificate** management.
    
- Certificates ensure **encryption and website authentication**.
    
- Providers often act as a **Certification Authority (CA)**.
    
- Certificates are used with **CDNs**, **load balancers**, and **web apps**.
    
- **Auto-renewal** helps manage certificate life cycles securely.

### 🔥 **Firewall Security**

- Firewalls inspect traffic and block anything not explicitly allowed (**whitelisting**).
    
- In cloud, firewalls are **virtual** and apply to **VMs and services**, not physical appliances.
    
- Often abstracted into the **network interface or service settings**.
    
- They log packets and can filter **inbound/outbound traffic** using IPs, ports, and protocols.

### 🔐 **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**

- Built on **OAuth 2.0** – adds an identity layer.
    
- Enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)** using trusted identity providers.
    
- Uses **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure and standardized identity data exchange.
    
- Supports **identity federation** with providers like Google or Microsoft.
    
- Enhances security using **claims-based identities** and reduces password fatigue.

### 🔄 **OAuth 2.0 Authorization**

- **Delegates access** without sharing passwords.
    
- Key players:
    
    - **Resource Owner** (user)
        
    - **Client** (app)
        
    - **Authorization Server** (issues token)
        
    - **Resource Server** (holds protected data)
        
- Grant types: **Authorization Code**, **Implicit**, **Password**, **Client Credentials**
    
- Widely used with APIs and mobile/web apps.
    
- Supports **PKCE** for extra protection (esp. on mobile).

### 👥 **Group-Based Access Control (GBAC)**

- Assigns permissions to **user groups**, not individuals.
    
- Common in **Active Directory**, **cloud identity**, and **ERP systems**.
    
- Improves **scalability**, simplifies onboarding, and reduces over-provisioning.
    
- Often used with RBAC (role-based) and ABAC (attribute-based) for layered security.
    

---

### 📊 **Audit Trail in Accounting**

- Tracks **financial transactions** (who did what, when).
    
- Ensures **transparency**, **fraud prevention**, and **regulatory compliance** (GAAP, IFRS).
    
- Modern systems use **automated, electronic audit trails**.
    
- Key for **SOX** and **GDPR** compliance.
