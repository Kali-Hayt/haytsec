## 10.2 Troubleshooting Security Issues

In this section, you will learn about troubleshooting security-related issues in the cloud. The focus is on the most common problems cloud customers face and how to begin troubleshooting them.

Keep in mind:
- The **cloud provider** handles security **of the infrastructure**.
- You, the **customer**, are responsible for **"top of the stack"** security:
  - User accounts
  - Sign-on issues
  - Authentication & authorization
  - Device hardening
  - Digital certificates

---

### üõë Account Privilege Escalation

**Privilege escalation** = user gets more access than they should.

Example:
- A regular user gets admin rights and can install/remove software or reconfigure systems.
- This could happen due to:
  - A bug
  - Poor design
  - Weak approval process

Fix it by:
- Giving users **only** the privileges they need
- Keeping **OS, apps, and antivirus** updated
- Ensuring apps run with **minimal privileges**
- Enforcing **mandatory access controls** (MAC)

## 10.2 Troubleshooting Security Issues

In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to identify and resolve common cloud security problems.  
Emphasis: Cloud providers secure the infrastructure ‚Äî you‚Äôre responsible for the **"top of the stack"** security like users, auth, hardening, and certs.

---

### üîê Account Privilege Escalation

- Happens when a user gains access to permissions they shouldn't have.
- Example: Regular user gets admin rights due to bug, oversight, or careless delegation.
- Can be caused by:
  - Design flaws
  - Improper delegation
  - Missing approval steps

**Prevention:**
- Grant **only needed privileges**
- Keep OS, software, antivirus updated
- Use **least privilege** and mandatory access controls

---

### üåê Network Access Issues

- Access control lists (ACLs) and firewalls must allow specific traffic.
- Cloud providers often restrict by **source IP range**.
- If IP isn‚Äôt in the allowed list, access is denied.

**Watch out for:**
- Security groups blocking traffic by default
- ACL misconfigurations
- Lack of allowed source IPs

---

### üîì Authentication

- Identifies **who** the user/device is
- Common methods: username + password, MFA, biometrics

**Troubleshooting tips:**
- Check logs for reasons: wrong password, disabled accounts, expired passwords
- Repeated failures ‚Üí account lockouts
- Look at **MFA failures** and biometric mismatches

---

### ‚úÖ Authorization

- Determines **what** a user can do after being authenticated
- Common setup issue: account created with **no or minimal privileges**

**Symptoms:**
- Can perform some actions, not others
- ‚ÄúAccess Denied‚Äù errors

**Fix:**
- Check logs to confirm which permissions were granted or missing

---

### üß© Federations

- Used to connect **on-prem Active Directory** to cloud auth
- Simplifies user management using federated identity

**When issues arise:**
- Check logs for federation health
- Review identity and permissions mapping
- Might require internal directory team support

---

### üîè Certificate Configuration Issues

- Most common cause = **expired cert**
- Also check for:
  - Subject name mismatches (usually after domain name changes)
  - Missing or misconfigured TLS

**Best practice:**
- Use a certificate management plan
- Monitor expiration dates
- Log and review failures thoroughly

---

## Summary

Troubleshoot cloud security by checking:
- Privileges and permissions
- Network access rules
- Auth + federation setup
- Certificate validity

Most answers live in the **logs**. Always start there.

### üå©Ô∏è Cloud Router

A Cloud Router in Google Cloud facilitates dynamic BGP routing between on-premises networks and Google Cloud.  
It dynamically propagates routes based on current network conditions, providing efficient and scalable connectivity for hybrid or multi-cloud environments.

Used for:
- Flexible routing policies  
- Seamless integration with Cloud VPN or Dedicated Interconnect

---

### üìú CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail captures and audits API activity within an AWS account.  
It offers visibility into user activity and security events.

It tracks:
- API calls via Console, SDKs, and CLI  
- Logs stored in Amazon S3 or CloudWatch

Helps with:
- Compliance  
- Detecting unauthorized access  
- Troubleshooting ops issues

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Device-Hardening Settings

To prevent intrusions and hacks, devices must be hardened.

Basics:
- Follow vendor/cloud best practices
- Use official support docs or whitepapers

üíÄ Trade-off:
- More hardening = less flexibility
- Changes like installs/updates can break things
- More secure = more time fixing stuff

üìù Document what was hardened and how‚Äîit helps later.

---

### ‚öíÔ∏è Cryptojacking

**Cryptojacking** = cybercrime where attackers hijack cloud or user systems to mine cryptocurrency (e.g., Monero).

Common methods:
- Malicious JavaScript in browsers
- Malware on endpoints
- Exploited cloud instances

üìâ Effects:
- Slows systems
- Increases electric/cloud costs

üîç Defense:
- Use endpoint security tools  
- Watch CPU/GPU usage  
- Harden browsers & monitor workloads  
- Patch all known vulnerabilities  
- Strong authentication to prevent access

---
## üßü Zombie Instances

- Zombie instances are inactive or underutilized cloud computing resources that still consume resources and incur costs.
- Common causes include poor cloud resource management and failing to decommission VMs or storage after use.
- Unmonitored zombie instances increase cloud sprawl, cost inefficiency, and security risk.

- These often result from automated provisioning with no matching deprovisioning policy.
- Neglected instances with outdated software are vulnerable to unauthorized access, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

- Solutions include:
  - Automated instance life cycle management
  - Idle resource detection tools
  - Tagging policies
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to dynamically provision/deprovision
  - Embed cost optimization and compliance into provisioning flows

---

## üåê External Attacks

- Cloud providers often provide basic external protections (DDoS, scanning).
- They can‚Äôt prevent all attacks‚Äîusers must still monitor for anomalies.
- Warning signs include:
  - Unusual network traffic
  - Login failures
  - Errors and spikes

- Strong baselines and firewall tools can help.
- Cloud providers may offer alerting or blocking of external attack sources.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Internal Attacks

- Most common type: **social engineering** (e.g., tricking someone to give credentials or open a door).
- Prevent with ongoing training, strong security culture, and healthy skepticism.

- Internal devices can:
  - Scan networks
  - Masquerade as other systems
  - Collect data from inside the perimeter

- Providers shut down malicious devices, monitor for intrusion, and respond to threats in real time.

---
## Maintain Sufficient Security Controls and Processes

- Cloud providers have dedicated security teams for physical and digital protection.
- But security of your cloud resources is **your responsibility**.
- No system is hacker-proof‚Äîdo your due diligence to stay ahead of threats.

- The threat landscape is always evolving.
  - As part of operations management, your cloud team should **regularly evaluate security posture**.
  - Identify novel attacks and vulnerabilities.

- üîê **Least privilege** principle:
  - Only grant the minimum access necessary.
  - Use **separation of duties**: no single person should have full access/control.
  - This reduces risk if an account is compromised or misused.

---
## Network Access Tunneling and Encryption

- Data sent across a network unencrypted is susceptible to interception and modification by an attacker.
- Encrypting data in transit is always a good idea, especially over public networks like the Internet.
- Strong encryption is **absolutely necessary**.

- üîê Standard approach: encrypt **all traffic** between cloud and on-prem using **VPN**.
  - Cloud providers offer **managed VPN services** to simplify this.
  - But VPNs can still suffer from:
    - Routing problems
    - Incorrect access control entries
    - Dropped connections
  - ‚úÖ Best practice: use **redundant VPNs** to multiple availability zones for continuous connectivity.

- When VPNs aren't feasible (e.g., cloud-to-customer scenarios):
  - Use secure application protocols:
    - **HTTPS**
    - **SSH**
    - **SFTP**
    - **SCP**
  - These protocols are secure **out of the box** and designed for transmitting sensitive data over public networks.
