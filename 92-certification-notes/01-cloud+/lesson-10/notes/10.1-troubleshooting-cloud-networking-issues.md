## 10.1 Troubleshooting Cloud Networking Issues

### 🧱 Why Cloud Networking Matters
- Networking in the cloud is just as essential as in traditional data centers.
- If the network goes down or slows, cloud services may degrade or fail.
- Fast and effective troubleshooting is critical—network is the lifeline.

### 🧱 Cloud Provider vs. Customer Responsibilities

**Cloud Provider handles:**
- Core infrastructure in their data centers
- Internet connections and high-speed interlinks between cloud **zones and regions**
- Internal backbone routing and switching
- These responsibilities are defined in the SLA (Service Level Agreement)

**You (the customer) handle:**
- Network architecture within your virtual cloud environment
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- Direct interconnects (e.g., ExpressRoute, AWS Direct Connect)
- Static or dynamic routing
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

### 🔍 What Happens in a Network Outage
- It’s not *if* but *when*—network impairments are inevitable
- You must pinpoint the **origin** of the issue: Is it your config? The provider? Routing between services?
- Know the **boundary of responsibility** so you can respond quickly and escalate properly

### ✅ Takeaway
When things break, be ready:
- Understand your role vs. the cloud provider
- Master the tools and configs you control
- Be familiar with the SLA for each service

## Identifying the Common Networking Issues in the Cloud

### 🧱 Key Areas to Understand
- IP addressing plans are a **core exam topic**
- You must know **subnetting** and **routing** as part of network design and troubleshooting

### 🧱 Network Latency
- **Latency** = Time for data to travel from source to destination
- Some delay is natural, but high latency causes:
  - Long delays
  - Timeout errors
  - Application performance problems

### 🧱 Congestion and QoS
- **Congestion** happens when traffic exceeds available bandwidth
- Result: **Dropped packets**
- Solution: Configure **Quality of Service (QoS)** to:
  - Prioritize certain traffic types
  - Control what gets dropped when under load
- Required understanding for the **Cloud+ exam**

### 🧱 Core Services to Troubleshoot
- DNS servers
- Firewalls
- Proxies
- These must be **understood and monitored** in cloud environments

### 🧱 Lower-Level Configurations (Data-Link Layer)
- **VLANs** (Virtual Local Area Networks)
- **VXLANs** (Virtual Extensible LANs)
- **Ethernet frame size**
- These settings may need tuning depending on your cloud platform

### ✅ Summary
- Know the **common causes** of cloud networking issues: latency, congestion, and misconfigurations
- Be able to **troubleshoot services** and configurations across multiple layers—from routing and IP to VLANs and QoS

---
## Incorrect Subnet Issues

### 🧱 Why Subnetting Matters in the Cloud
- Application servers are often grouped in the same IP subnet to allow **local communication** without passing through routers
- This reduces **latency**, improves **performance**, and keeps traffic local to the subnet

### 🧱 Subnet-Level Security
- When servers are grouped into subnets, you can:
  - Apply **firewall rules** at the subnet level
  - Control ingress and egress traffic more efficiently

### 🧱 IP Addressing and Subnet Masks
- A **32-bit IP address** has:
  - **Network portion** (left bits)
  - **Host portion** (right bits)
- The dividing line is controlled by the **subnet mask**
  - Example: `/24` means 24 bits for network, 8 for hosts

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Incorrect Subnets
- If a host uses the **wrong subnet mask**, it might:
  - Send packets to a router unnecessarily
  - Fail to reach other hosts in the same subnet
- Subnet misconfigs can cause **routing loops**, **unreachable services**, or **latency spikes**

### 🧱 Using Documentation
- Your network docs should define:
  - Addressing scheme
  - Subnet ranges
  - Gateway addresses
- Use this info to:
  - Check interface configs
  - Verify that IP, subnet mask, and gateway settings are correct

### ✅ Summary
- Incorrect subnetting = silent killer of network comms
- Always verify masks and host configs match the design doc

---
## Incorrect IP Addressing

### 🧱 Why IP Addressing Is Critical
- Every networked device must have a valid **IP address** to communicate.
- When deploying cloud infrastructure, part of the planning phase includes:
  - Creating an IP address scheme
  - Validating it at implementation

### 🔍 Troubleshooting IP Addressing Issues
- When problems arise **after deployment**, always ask:
  - Were any changes made recently?
  - Check **change logs**, **tickets**, and **emails** to trace the issue
- Investigate:
  - If the **IP address** and **subnet mask** are correct
  - If **reserved addresses** (like the gateway) have been reused or overwritten

### 🧱 Default Gateway and Reserved Addresses
- Some IPs in a subnet are **reserved**—especially the **default gateway**, often the lowest IP in the range
- Misusing a reserved address can break comms across the whole subnet

### ❌ Duplicate IPs = Silent Breakage
- Happens when **two devices** get the same IP—like giving two people the same phone number
- Symptom: **intermittent loss of connectivity**
- Tools:
  - `ping` to check for response consistency
  - Check the **ARP table** to see if a MAC address keeps changing for the same IP

### ✅ Best Practice
- Document the IP range, gateway, reserved blocks
- Confirm changes against your plan before rollout

---
## Incorrect Default Gateways and Routing

### 🧱 What Is a Default Gateway?
- A **default gateway** is the **IP address of the router** on a local subnet that provides a path to external networks
- Sometimes called a **router**, but the gateway is the device’s first-hop to destinations outside the subnet

### 🧱 How It Works
- Example: A cloud web server sends traffic to its default gateway, which then forwards it to the Internet
- Every device must know its **default gateway IP** to send data beyond the local subnet
- This gateway IP must be documented and configured correctly

### 🧱 Packet Routing Logic
- When a device sends data:
  - If destination is **inside the subnet**, it sends the data directly
  - If destination is **outside**, it sends the data to the **default gateway**, which uses routing tables to forward it

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Tips
- If you can **ping other devices in the same subnet** but not outside it:
  - Check the **default gateway IP config**
  - Try pinging the gateway itself
  - If that works, but external connections fail → **routing issue**
- Common signs:
  - Can't reach external IPs
  - Local subnet is fine
  - Misconfigured gateway or broken routes are likely culprits

### ✅ Summary
- The gateway is the bridge between your subnet and the wider world
- If it’s misconfigured or unreachable, all external connectivity fails

---
## Network Infrastructure Troubleshooting

### 🧱 Cloud Provider Responsibilities
- Cloud service providers manage all **hardware infrastructure**
  - Includes: power, cooling, physical security, and other facility-level components
- These elements are **not your responsibility** as the customer
- This is part of the **shared responsibility model**

### 🔍 How to Monitor Provider Infrastructure
- Cloud providers often offer:
  - **Uptime dashboards**
  - **Service health pages**
- These browser-based dashboards show:
  - Current service issues
  - Historical uptime metrics
  - Ongoing maintenance alerts

### ✅ Practical Tip
If you're troubleshooting network issues and suspect an infrastructure fault:
- Check the **provider’s status dashboard first**
- Helps you rule out broader outages before digging into your own configs

---
## Network Latency Troubleshooting

### 🧱 Why Latency Matters
- Latency is critical for **real-time apps** like voice and video
  - Delay in voice = disrupted conversation
- Cloud-based apps and storage access rely on **remote data paths**
  - Increases round-trip time
  - Congests the network and slows responses

### 🧱 Causes of Latency
- **Congestion** from high traffic volume
- **Wireless interference** (especially in Wi-Fi setups)
- **Compression delays**
- **QoS policies** that prioritize traffic can buffer low-priority packets
- Unknown **routing paths** make latency sources harder to pinpoint

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Strategy
- Don't try to trace each hop—track **end-to-end latency**
- Tools can:
  - Monitor and measure latency from source to destination
  - Trigger **alerts** when latency exceeds thresholds

### ✅ Practical Insight
- Use **network management platforms** with testing capabilities
- Focus on **total user experience**, not just individual device delay
- End-to-end latency is the real measure of cloud performance

### 🌐 Latency: What You Control vs. What You Don’t

- Cloud providers **monitor and manage latency** within their infrastructure to avoid impacting user experience
- But **internet-based latency** (outside the cloud data center) is often **out of your control**
  - Mobile networks (e.g., cell towers) introduce **variable latency**
  - Public internet paths can change dynamically

### 🧪 Measuring Latency
- **Network monitoring tools** track:
  - Standard latency benchmarks
  - Real-time delay metrics
- Common method: `ping`
  - Measures **round-trip time** (source → destination → back)
  - Useful for detecting **jitter**, **delay**, or dropped packets

### ✅ Summary
- Track **end-to-end latency**, not device-to-device
- Know which parts of the network are **yours to fix** vs. **provider-managed**
- Use ping and monitoring tools to spot problems early

---
## Domain Name System (DNS)

### 🧱 Why DNS Matters
- DNS maps **domain names** to **IP addresses** using **Type A records**
- DNS updates are needed whenever:
  - Devices are added/removed
  - Hostnames or IP addresses change

### 🧱 Who Manages DNS?
- Many cloud providers **offer DNS**, but you’re usually responsible for:
  - Day-to-day DNS operations
  - Updating records to reflect current infrastructure

### 🔍 Troubleshooting DNS Issues
- Verify that **DNS records match** current IP/host assignments
  - Mismatched records = devices resolve to **wrong IPs**
- Use tools:
  - `nslookup` or `dig` to query the DNS server
  - Confirm correct resolution for the domain in question
- Test connectivity:
  - `ping` to check reachability
  - `traceroute` to find where traffic is being blocked/stopped

### ✅ Practical Tip
- Keep DNS records **accurate and updated**
- Troubleshoot from both name-resolution and **network-path** angles

---
## Quality of Service (QoS)

### 🧱 Why Not All Traffic Is Equal
- Different applications have different **network requirements**:
  - File transfers and email = **delay-tolerant**
  - Voice/video calls = **delay-sensitive**
- Delay and **jitter** (latency variation) can ruin real-time experiences like video conferencing or VoIP
- QoS helps ensure critical apps (e.g., telemedicine, meetings) don’t get stuck behind Netflix streams or backups

### 🧱 What QoS Does
- **Quality of Service** = Network’s ability to prioritize traffic types based on:
  - Packet headers
  - IP/port
  - Protocol types
- Routers and switches can read these markings to:
  - Prioritize, delay, or drop packets accordingly

### 🔍 Where QoS Helps
- Realtime services (voice/video)
- Storage systems (some protocols break on packet loss)
- Backup traffic (can flood bandwidth without control)
- Routing control traffic (needs to stay alive or the whole system fails)

### 🧪 QoS in Practice
- IP header contains **Type-of-Service (ToS)** field
- Network devices can:
  - Read and **honor markings**
  - Modify or append them dynamically
- Must be configured **end-to-end**, device-by-device
  - If one device ignores the marking → QoS fails

### ⚠️ Limitations of QoS
- QoS doesn't **add** bandwidth; it just **prioritizes** use of existing bandwidth
- It doesn’t work over the **public internet**, only in **controlled domains** (e.g., inside a cloud VPC or data center)
- No effect when there's **no congestion**

### 🧠 Real-World Scenarios
- Email delay: No problem
- Voice delay: Big problem
- Backup replication: Can swamp the pipe
- Video jitter: Unusable meetings
- Medical traffic vs. entertainment traffic: One may be life-or-death

### ✅ Key Takeaways
- QoS becomes critical **only during congestion**
- Used to make sure the **most important traffic wins**
- Best used in **enterprise, cloud**, or hybrid setups where you control the path

## Maximum Transmission Units (MTU)

### 🧱 What Is MTU?
- **MTU** = Maximum size (in bytes) of an Ethernet frame
- Standard MTU = **1,518 bytes**
- If a frame exceeds the MTU, it gets **fragmented**
- Frames larger than standard = **jumbo frames**

### 🧱 Why Jumbo Frames?
- Fewer, larger frames = less **overhead**
- Improves performance by:
  - Reducing CPU interrupts
  - Lowering packet-processing frequency
- A **jumbo frame** can be up to **9,000 bytes**

### 🧱 Common Use Cases
- Jumbo frames are common in:
  - **Cloud environments**
  - **Enterprise data centers**
  - **iSCSI** and **Fibre Channel over Ethernet** for storage traffic

- Supported by most modern:
  - Switches
  - NICs (Network Interface Cards)
  - Network paths (if properly configured)

### 🔍 Troubleshooting MTU Issues
- Look for **fragmentation** in interface statistics
- Symptoms of misconfigured MTU:
  - Delays
  - Packet loss
  - Performance drops in data-heavy transfers
- **Verify** MTU settings at:
  - Source
  - Destination
  - Every hop in the path

### ✅ Best Practice
- Match jumbo frame settings across the entire path
- Default jumbo MTU size: **9,000 bytes** (used in storage-heavy networks)

---
## Available Bandwidth

### 🧱 Why Bandwidth Matters
- Low bandwidth leads to:
  - **High latency**
  - **Packet loss**
  - **App failures or degraded performance**
- Bandwidth = the actual **throughput capacity** of the network from source to destination

### 🧪 Measuring Bandwidth
- Tools like **iPerf** can test **end-to-end throughput**
- Simple method: download a large file and time it
  - Divide file size by time = bandwidth estimate

### 🧱 Cloud Network Design
- Cloud data centers use:
  - **High-speed links**
  - Optimized traffic routing for common data center patterns

### 🔍 Monitoring & Alerts
- Network management systems can:
  - Detect link saturation
  - Alert engineers when more capacity is needed

### ✅ Summary
- Don’t confuse “link speed” with real-world **available bandwidth**
- Regular monitoring helps avoid bottlenecks before they break production

---
## Validating Firewall and Proxy Configurations

### 🧱 Firewall Rule Validation

- After implementing new rules, validate that the firewall is **processing them as expected**
- Firewalls typically process rules **top-down**:
  - First match wins
  - No further rules are processed after a match
- Common issue:
  - A **deny rule** placed above a **permit rule** blocks traffic unintentionally
  - Solution: move permit rule **above** any conflicting deny rule
- ✅ Enable **logging**:
  - Helps see which rule matched
  - Aids troubleshooting by providing real-time feedback

### 🧱 Proxy Configuration

- A **proxy**:
  - Intercepts traffic between source and destination
  - Can filter, log, redirect, or balance traffic
- Two types:
  - **Web proxies**: used for filtering user traffic
  - **Reverse proxies**: load balance traffic to backend servers

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Proxy Issues

- Confirm the proxy:
  - Has a **valid IP, subnet mask, and default gateway**
  - Is not misconfigured in the browser or client
- Check the **proxy logs** for:
  - Rejected connections
  - Internal errors
- Verify:
  - Target URL is reachable
  - Other devices on the subnet can access the same destination
- Use tests from **multiple clients/subnets** to determine:
  - If issue is isolated
  - If it’s an **intermittent** or systemic problem

### ✅ Summary

- Rule order matters — **top-down processing** can break traffic flows
- Logging is your best friend for both firewalls and proxies
- Isolate proxy issues by testing from multiple clients/subnets

---
## VLAN and VXLAN Issues

### 🧱 VLAN Basics
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN)** = Layer 2 segmentation to isolate networks over shared infrastructure
- Based on IEEE **802.1Q** (Dot1Q), allows up to **4,094 VLANs**
- VLANs are identified by tags inserted in Ethernet frames
- Common in traditional office/data center networks

### 🧱 VXLAN: Scaling Beyond VLANs
- **VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)** was introduced to overcome VLAN scaling limits
- Hyperscale environments need **millions of networks**, not just 4,000
- VXLAN uses:
  - **MAC-in-UDP encapsulation**
  - UDP transport for Ethernet frames
  - An **8-byte (64-bit) header** including a **24-bit VNI (VXLAN Network Identifier)**

### 🧱 VXLAN Use Cases
- Ideal for:
  - Spanning **availability zones**
  - Extending L2 networks across **regions**
  - Providing tenant isolation in multi-tenant cloud environments

### 🔍 Troubleshooting VLAN/VXLAN

#### VLAN
- VLANs usually map to one **Layer 3 subnet**
- Check:
  - VLAN mappings
  - Switch trunk links
  - If VLAN tags are passing between switches

#### VXLAN
- Troubleshooting is mostly the **cloud provider’s responsibility**
- Still, you can:
  - Analyze **log files**
  - Use **vendor monitoring tools**
  - Run **CLI diagnostics**
  - Identify mismatches, failures, or misrouted VNIs

### ✅ Summary
- VLANs are easy to understand but **limited in scale**
- VXLANs solve scale by tunneling L2 over L3 using UDP
- VXLAN troubleshooting = more complex, often handled by the provider

---
## Software-Defined Network (SDN)

### 🧱 What Is SDN?
- SDN = **Software-Defined Networking**

- Critical for modern cloud-native and hyperscale environments

---
## Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

### 🧱 What Is BGP?
- BGP = **Border Gateway Protocol**
- De facto standard for routing between **autonomous systems (AS)** on the Internet
- Type: **Path-vector protocol**
  - Chooses routes based on **policies** and **routing attributes**
  - Not focused on performance (e.g., latency, congestion)

### 🌐 BGP Scope
- Operates **globally**
- Connects:
  - ISPs
  - Cloud providers
  - Large enterprise networks

### 🔁 BGP Behavior
- **Dynamically updates routes** as networks change
- Prevents routing loops using the **AS-path attribute**
- **Does not handle congestion** — that’s a job for lower-layer protocols
- Reliability depends on:
  - **Peering arrangements**
  - **Failover mechanisms**

### 🛡 Security Considerations
- BGP has **no built-in security**
- Vulnerable to:
  - **Route hijacking**
  - **Unauthorized traffic redirection**
- Security enhancements include:
  - **Route Origin Authorization (ROA)**
  - **Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)**

### ✅ Summary
- BGP is essential for Internet-wide routing
- It's policy-based, not performance-optimized
- Must be **hardened** with additional tools to maintain integrity
