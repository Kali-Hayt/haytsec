- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**  
  A symmetrical block cipher approved by many governments, including the U.S. and Canada, for encrypting sensitive data. It is also a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

- **Amazon GuardDuty**  
  A threat detection service that continuously scans AWS accounts, workloads, and data for malicious activity or unauthorized behavior.

- **Amazon Inspector**  
  A security assessment-as-a-service that helps identify vulnerabilities and best practice deviations in AWS workloads.

- **cipher**  
  Any method of encrypting data by concealing its readability and meaning.

- **Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP)**  
  The process for certifying IT security in computer systems. DIACAP compliance is required to meet U.S. Department of Defense security standards for contractors.

- **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)**  
  An asymmetrical encryption that uses a private key and a public key. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is the framework that uses protocols such as DSA for encryption. With PKI and DSA, the common implementation is an asymmetrical protocol using a public and private key pair, like DSA, to set up an encrypted connection for exchanging symmetrical keys. The symmetrical keys are then used for bulk encryption and decryption since they are faster and require less processing.

- **discretionary access control (DAC)**  
  Gives users the ability to grant or assign rights to objects and make access decisions.

- **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)**  
  A U.S. federal law that outlines the framework to protect federal government information, operations, and facilities.

- **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)**  
  A U.S. federal government-wide program that outlines the standards for a security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

- **FIPS 140-2**  
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication that coordinates the requirements and standards for cryptography modules.

- **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**  
  A standardized network tunneling protocol used to encapsulate any network layer protocol inside a virtual link between two locations. GRE is commonly used to create tunnels across a public network that carries private network traffic.

- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001**  
  A quality standard that ensures a cloud provider meets all regulatory and statutory requirements for its product and service offerings.

- **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)**  
  Restricts information from being disseminated to certain foreign entities that could assist in the import or export of arms. ITAR defines a list of data security requirements that cloud companies can certify compliance with to meet U.S. regulations.

- **IP Security (IPsec)**  
  A framework or architecture that uses many different protocols to provide integrity, confidentiality of data, and authentication of data on a TCP/IP network.

- **Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)**  
  A remote access communications protocol that is a common method for connecting to a remote device over the Internet.

- **mandatory access control (MAC)**  
  Highly controlled systems where access is defined by strict levels of clearance. Common in secure environments such as defense or financial systems.

- **Motion Picture Society of America (MPAA)**  
  Publishes best practices for storing, processing, and delivering protected media and content securely over the Internet.

- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**  
  A U.S. federal organization that defines cloud computing standards and models.

- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**  
  Sets the requirements to ensure that companies processing, storing, or transmitting credit card information handle data securely and in compliance with industry standards.

- **Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)**  
  Allows a remote PC or network to access a remote network, such as a cloud, by encapsulating PPP packets inside of GRE tunnels.

- **public key infrastructure (PKI)**  
  A standardized set of roles, policies, and procedures used to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates, and manage public/private key encryption.

- **Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4)**  
  Uses a shared key to encrypt and decrypt a stream of data. RC4 was commonly used to secure wireless connections and web transactions as an encryption protocol used in SSL.

- **Rivest Cipher 5 (RC5)**  
  The replacement for RC4. It is also a symmetrical block cipher algorithm that uses a variable-length key.
- **Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)**  
  An asymmetrical encryption that uses a private key and a public key. PKI is the framework that uses protocols such as RSA for encryption. With PKI and RSA, the common implementation is an asymmetrical protocol using a public and private key pair such as RSA to set up an encrypted connection to exchange symmetrical keys. Then the symmetrical keys are used to perform bulk encryption and decryption since they are faster and require less processing.

- **role-based access control (RBAC)**  
  A method in which access rights are granted to, or restricted from, users based on which roles they perform in an organization.

- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)**  
  Protocols that operate on top of TCP and provide an encrypted session between the client and the server.

- **security policy**  
  A document that defines your company’s cloud controls, organizational policies, responsibilities, and underlying technologies to secure your cloud deployment.
- **Service Organization Controls (SOC) 1**  
  Also known as SSAE 16 and ISAE 3402. This is a report that outlines controls on a service organization and the internal controls of financial reporting operations.

- **SOC 2**  
  A report that concerns a business’s nonfinancial reporting controls for availability, confidentiality, privacy, processing integrity, and security of a system.

- **SOC 3**  
  A report for public disclosure of financial controls and security reporting.

- **Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)**  
  A symmetrical cipher. Three encryption keys of various lengths are used. The first key is used to encrypt a block of data, a second key is then used to decrypt the block, and a third key is used to encrypt it again. This triple encryption function on each block of data is reversed to decrypt the data.
