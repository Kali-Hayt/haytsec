# 🔐 3.2 Access Control

## 👥 Authentication vs. Authorization
- **Authentication** = Identity proof (username, password, token)
- **Authorization** = Permissions assigned after authentication
- 🔑 Authenticate first, then authorize!

## 👤 Identities
- Users and services have accounts = "identities"
- Assign **roles** or **groups** instead of individual permissions

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Groups
- Create groups by job function (e.g., Help Desk, Admins)
- Assign roles/permissions to groups
- Users inherit group permissions

## 🌐 Network Access Control
- **Blacklist** = Block bad stuff, allow rest (less secure)
- **Whitelist** = Deny all by default, allow only what’s needed (more secure)

## ☁️ Cloud Service Models & Security
| Model  | You Manage     | Cloud Provider Manages |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| IaaS   | OS, Apps, Data | VM host, networking     |
| PaaS   | Apps           | OS, runtime             |
| SaaS   | Just Data      | Everything else         |

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment Models
- **Private** = Org-owned, full control
- **Public** = Shared, security split with provider
- **Hybrid** = Combo of private/public
- **Community** = Shared by group/orgs

## 🧱 Access Control Types
- **RBAC** = Permissions by job role (e.g., admin, dev)
- **MAC** = Security labels (e.g., Top Secret)
- **DAC** = User sets permissions on their own files/resources

## 🔐 MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Uses 2+ of:
  - Something you know
  - Something you have
  - Something you are

## 🔐 SSO (Single Sign-On)
- One login for multiple systems
- Faster, easier, centralized control
