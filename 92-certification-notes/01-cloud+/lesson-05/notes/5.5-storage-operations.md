## 📚 Overview

In this section, you’ll learn about _storage operations_ related to backing up and restoring your data.

Backups are a critical part of your IT strategy and are **usually required** for:
- ✅ Regulatory compliance  
- ✅ Corporate policy  
- ✅ Business continuity

---
## ☁️ Cloud Backup Strategy

Backups may be performed in two ways:
- 🔹 **By the cloud provider** (as part of their service offering or managed service)
- 🔹 **By the customer**, using their own tools or custom strategies

### Why this matters:
Cloud customers may:
- 🔐 Need to meet specific business or compliance requirements
- 📈 Require custom scheduling, retention, or encryption policies
- ⚙️ Want to reduce reliance on provider-managed recovery services

---

> 💡 Tip: Always verify that backup solutions align with your organization’s **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** and **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** goals.

---
## 🔁 Types of Backups

Many different types of backups are available to meet use cases and objectives.  
This section covers the most common backups relevant for the **Cloud+ exam**.

---

### 🧠 Two Critical Metrics

- **🕒 Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**  
  ➤ The maximum amount of time you're willing to wait to recover data and get systems back online after a failure.

- **📉 Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**  
  ➤ The maximum amount of data you're willing to lose, measured by the time between backups.

---

### ⚠️ Why They Matter

- If you have a **low RTO**, you need **faster recovery methods**.  
  Example: Recovering from **tape** is slower than from **hard drives or SSDs**.

- If you have a **low RPO**, you need to **back up more often**.  
  Example: Daily backups may not be enough — you might need **hourly or real-time** backups.

---

> 🧩 As you continue, consider how each backup method affects your ability to meet both **RTO** and **RPO**.

---
## 🖼️ Image Backups

**Image backups** are byte-by-byte copies of entire block storage volumes.

Also known as:
- *Disaster backup*
- *Cloning*
- *Ghosting*
- *Block-level backups*

---

### 🔁 Use Cases

- 🛠️ Recover VMs after failure or corruption  
- 🔄 Roll back after a bad update  
- 🚀 Rapid workstation provisioning with pre-installed apps/settings  

---

### 🧪 How It Works

The process involves:
1. Copying a **source hard drive** with all apps and configurations
2. Saving that copy as an image
3. Deploying the image to other systems

> Example: Clonezilla, Norton Ghost, Acronis True Image

---
## 📸 Snapshots

Storage **snapshots** are point-in-time copies of a storage volume or image, useful for reducing RTO and RPO.  
Two common types:

---

### 🔹 Copy-on-Write Snapshot

- 🧠 Stores **changes** after the snapshot in a separate reserved area  
- 🛡️ **Original data remains untouched**  
- ✍️ Any write after the snapshot redirects the old data to snapshot space  
- ⚠️ **Impact on performance** because writes are delayed while data is saved to snapshot block

📝 Snapshot is in-sync with the time it was taken.

---

### 🔸 Redirect-on-Write Snapshot

- 🧭 Instead of copying blocks, it uses **pointers** to redirect new data writes  
- 🔄 Original data stays in place  
- ⚡ Less I/O overhead than copy-on-write  
- 🚀 **More efficient** and faster response time  

---
## 🗄️ Database Backups

There are a couple of ways to back up a database:

---

### 🔹 Volume-Based Backup  
- Backup the **volume** on which the database resides  
- Allows **remounting** on another VM  
- Commonly used with **VM snapshots**  
- Useful for **quick recovery** of the full environment

---

### 🔸 Transaction Log Backup  
- Backup **transaction logs** every **5–15 minutes**  
- Helps capture **real-time changes** between full backups  
- Enables **point-in-time recovery**

---

### 🔻 Full Database Dump  
- Also known as a **database dump**  
- Saves database as a **file or collection of files**  
- Can be restored or transferred to another system  
- Used when **structure + data** need to be archived

---
## 🧩 Application-Level Backups

Some applications can back up and restore their own:
- **Configuration files**
- **Data files**

These are called **_application-level backups_**, and they're useful when:

- You want to **reinstall the app from scratch**,  
  but restore it to its **previous state**  
- You want a **faster, cleaner recovery** than block-level methods

---

### 📦 Example: Database Dump  
- You reinstall the database application  
- Then **restore** the database using a previous dump  
- ✅ Less time-consuming than full image restoration

> **Key Advantage:**  
> Lightweight, app-specific recovery — avoids touching the whole system

---
## 💾 Full Backups

A _full backup_ is a **complete copy of all data** — not just the changes.

While similar to a clone, it differs in that:
- A **clone** copies the entire disk **block by block**
- A **full backup** copies files **at the file level**
- Full backups are often **compressed** and **encrypted**

---

### 🔁 Backup Strategy
- Full backups are typically scheduled **infrequently**
- Often followed by **incremental** or **differential** backups

---

### ✅ Advantages
- One-shot: Complete, up-to-date snapshot
- Useful for clean restoration

### ⚠️ Disadvantages
- **Time-consuming** to perform
- Uses **significant storage space**
- Must copy **everything**, even unchanged data

> 🛠️ Use full backups as a reliable base —  
> then build faster strategies (like incrementals) on top

---

## 📘 Differential Backups

A _differential backup_ uses the **most recent full backup** as its base.

It backs up **all changes made since the last full backup** — not just since the last differential.

---

### 🔄 How It Works:
- You start with a full backup (e.g., Sunday)
- On Monday, the differential backup stores all changes since Sunday
- On Tuesday, it stores changes from both **Monday + Tuesday**
- The set **grows larger** each day until the next full backup

---

### ✅ Advantages
- **Fast restore**: You only need the **full backup** + **latest differential**
- Easier to manage than incremental backups

### ⚠️ Disadvantages
- Backup size **increases daily**
- More storage used than incremental, less than full

> 🧠 Think of it as cumulative:  
> It captures the "difference" since the last full backup — hence the name!

---
## 🔁 Synthetic Full Backup

A _synthetic full backup_ is an **outdated full backup** that’s updated with all **later incremental backups** — effectively creating a new full backup **without rerunning a full backup job**.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works
- Combines the **original full backup** with all **incremental backups** since then.
- Built **offline** using backup storage, **not by re-copying** data from live systems.
- Saves **time** and **performance** impact on production environments.

---

### 📌 Backup Block Tracking
- When data is modified, it's **flagged** for backup.
- After a full, differential, or incremental backup, flags are **reset**.
- Backup software uses these flags to skip or include blocks in future operations.

---

### ✅ Advantages
- **No strain** on live systems
- **Faster** than redoing a full backup
- Efficient for systems with **limited maintenance windows**

> 🧠 Think of it like patching your last full backup with all the updates since, rather than re-downloading everything from scratch.

---
## 🎯 Backup Targets

The _backup target_ is the **endpoint or storage system** where the backup data is stored.

---

### 📦 Common Backup Targets

**In a data center:**
- Disks
- Tape drives
- Optical media

**In the cloud:**
- File/object stores
- Block storage volumes
- Managed filesystems
- Virtual tape libraries

---

### 🧠 Selection Based on Source Data
The way your source data is stored **determines your backup target**:
- 🔹 Block storage → snapshot → stored in object storage
- 🔹 Database → copy to another DB server + dump to file

---

### 🔁 The 3-2-1 Rule (Backup Best Practice)

> You should always have:
> - ✅ **3 copies** of your data  
> - ✅ **2 different media types**  
> - ✅ **1 copy off-site**

Example: Use a **DR (Disaster Recovery)** site as your off-site backup location. If your main data center goes offline, the DR site can restore operations.

---
## 🔁 Replicas

_Replicas_ serve as **live, secondary data stores**.

---

### 📘 Examples of Replicas

- **Read Replicas (Databases)**  
  - Create one or more read-only copies.
  - Stored locally or remotely.
  - Updated in **real time** from the master.
  - Used to **scale** read performance and **reduce load** on the master.

---

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**  
  - Store **cached copies** of web assets (video, audio, etc.) at edge locations.
  - Geographically distributed.
  - Provide **faster performance** for end users.
  - Improve **resiliency** if the main source fails.

---

### ⚙️ System-Level Replication

- Operating systems, storage management software, and virtualization platforms use **storage replication**.
- Data written to one volume is **automatically copied** to another.
- Supports:
  - High **availability**
  - Fault **tolerance**
  - Disaster **recovery**
- A **replica** is the secondary location that receives the synced copy.

---
## 🖴 Local Backups

_Local backups_ are stored **in proximity to the original data**.

---

### ⚙️ Example
Cloning a **VM's disk volume** and storing it on the same storage system as the VM — this counts as a local backup.

---

### ✅ Advantage
- **Speed** — backups and restores are much faster when everything is local.

---

### ❌ Disadvantage
- **Single point of failure** — if the local storage fails, **both the original and backup** are lost.

---
## 🌐 Remote Backups

_Remote backups_ are stored **separately from the original data** — typically **at a significant geographic distance**.

---

### ✅ Advantages
- Survive catastrophic events like **fire**, **flood**, or **natural disasters**.
- Required by many **corporate policies** and **regulations**.
- Improves **resiliency** and **disaster recovery** readiness.

---

### 🏢 Cloud & Data Centers
- Data is often stored in **separate data centers**, located **geographically apart**.
- Cloud providers use **regions and availability zones** connected via **high-speed fiber**.
- Large backup sets can move efficiently across regions.

---
## 🏢 On-Site Infrastructure

On-site infrastructure provides **computing, storage, and network resources** within an organization’s physical location.

---

### ✅ Benefits
- Full **control over IT resources**, with minimal reliance on third-party providers.
- Ideal for organizations with **high security** and **compliance** requirements.
- Reduces risk of external threats through **physical retention** of data.
- Supports **custom configuration** of hardware, software, and disaster recovery systems.
- Enhances **resiliency** via:
  - Physical access controls
  - Custom networks
  - Redundant power sources
- Meets **regional legal frameworks** for data processing.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges
- **High capital** and **maintenance costs**.
- Requires dedicated IT staff for monitoring and management.
- **Scalability** is limited; expansion demands more space and money.
- Many businesses now use **hybrid models**, combining on-site and cloud resources.

---
## 🔁 Backup and Restore Operations

So far, we've covered *what* to back up and *where*. In this section, you'll learn operational considerations for the **"when"** and **"how"** of backing up and restoring data.

---

### 📄 Backup Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Cloud service providers offering backups as a managed service will publish **service level agreements (SLAs)** that define:

- **Service levels** for backup operations
- **Guaranteed uptime** (e.g., 99.9% availability/month)
- **Scheduled maintenance windows**
- **What is covered and what is not**
- **Responsibilities** of the provider
- **Remedies** if SLAs are not met (typically monetary credits)

SLAs define the **boundaries of responsibility** and what compensations are available when expectations aren’t met.

---
### ⏰ Scheduling

The *backup window* is the designated time period during which a backup operation can occur.

Backup applications allow you to define:
- **When** the backup happens
- **What type** of backup is performed

**Example:**
- Full backup: Sundays, 1:00 a.m. – 5:30 a.m.
- Incremental backups: Every other day, 1:00 a.m. – 2:00 a.m.

🛠️ **Key consideration:**  
The window must be long enough to complete the operation, accounting for:
- Volume of data
- Network transfer time
- Write time to storage media

Don't shortchange the schedule or you'll risk incomplete backups.

---
### ⚙️ Backup Configurations

Backup setup and management depends on the **level of service** you've purchased from the cloud provider.

Most providers offer **storage as a managed service**, giving you tools to define:
- Backup rules
- Lifecycle operations

You can configure these using:
- Web interface
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- API

Once configured, the provider uses **automation** and **orchestration systems** to carry out the backups.

✅ Set it once. Let automation do the rest.

---
### 🔗 Dependencies

When planning backups, **consider system dependencies**.

For example:
- An application might rely on a database.
- Backing up only one won’t cut it — you must back up **both** the app and its database.
- Even then, during **restore**, both must interoperate properly.

🧠 A backup is only as good as your ability to **restore it**.

✅ Always test restore operations to make sure your backup strategy actually works.

---
### 💾 Online vs. Offline

**Offline storage** means the storage medium is **physically removed** from the system and must be reattached to access the data.

Examples:
- Tape drives (require manual insertion)
- DVDs, CDs
- USB drives
- Off-site storage vaults

🔒 **Advantages**:
- Safe from remote threats
- Great for **long-term archival**
- **Cost-effective** for infrequently accessed data

---

**Online storage** stays connected to the system and is accessible at any time.

⚡ **Advantages**:
- Always available
- Easy and quick to access
- Ideal for frequent backups

**Summary**:  
- **Offline = Secure & archival**  
- **Online = Fast & always available**

---

### 🗂️ Retention

Regulatory requirements may define **how long** backups must be retained. Be aware of these laws so you know:
- ✅ When you **must** keep backups
- ❌ When you **may not** destroy them

---

**Versioning** can help protect against accidental deletion in **object storage**.

🔒 **WORM Media** (Write-Once, Read-Many):
- Can only be written once, **cannot be modified**
- Helps meet compliance for unchangeable backups
- Common WORM-capable types:
  - 🎞️ Tape drives  
  - 💽 Hard drives  
  - 💾 SD cards

**⚠️ Note:** Data can still be **destroyed** even on WORM media.
