## 7.4 Summary â€“ Cloud Management Operations

This lesson focused on the ongoing operational tasks associated with managing a cloud deployment. A major topic was the collection of monitoring and management data. Once collected, this data can be used to establish a **baseline** by tracking key performance metrics over a specified period. That baseline serves as a reference point for detecting anomalies, forecasting growth, and planning for expansion.

- If a system deviates from the baseline, a **trigger** can generate alerts.
- **Notification systems** distribute alerts via text, email, or API.

### Resource Allocation and Support Agreements

The lesson covered how to assess whether your current resource allocations are sufficient or excessive, and how to scale capacity appropriately.

- **Support agreements** are critical for managing cloud infrastructure.
- You reviewed provider responsibilities and escalation procedures.

---

### Configuration and Change Management

Configuration and change management are ongoing responsibilities in cloud environments.

- Backups and device configuration documentation must be maintained.
- The **change management process** minimizes the risk of errors and ensures smooth implementation.

---

### Autoscaling and Elasticity

Cloud workloads are dynamic. As demand increases or decreases, your environment must adapt.

- **Cloud bursting** allows workloads to temporarily expand into additional resources.
- **Autoscaling systems** automatically add/remove resources based on metrics.
- These features leverage the **elasticity** of virtualized cloud infrastructure.

---

### Application Lifecycle Management

You were introduced to **application lifecycle concepts**, including:

- Initial deployment
- Updates and upgrades
- Eventual **retirement**

Understanding these stages is essential for managing long-term cloud applications.

---

### Business-Driven Cloud Management

Cloud strategies often need to evolve in response to business conditions.

- **Mergers, acquisitions, and spin-offs** can disrupt cloud operations.
- Regulatory changes may require updates to configurations or policies.

---

### User Account Management

The lesson concluded with a detailed review of user identity and access control:

- **Identification and authentication** concepts
- **Federated systems** and external directory services
- Role- and permission-based access
- **Single sign-on (SSO)** and **password policies**
- User account **creation**, **management**, and **disablement**

These practices support secure and efficient cloud resource usage.
