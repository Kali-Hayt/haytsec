## Cloud+ Quiz Recap Notes (Lesson: Intro to Cloud Computing)

### ✅ Key Terms & Concepts

#### 🔁 Elasticity vs Bursting

|Feature|Elasticity|Bursting|
|---|---|---|
|Duration|Ongoing scaling (up/down)|Temporary boost|
|Triggered by|Normal demand fluctuations|Sudden performance spike|
|Resources|Automatically adds/removes resources|Temporarily taps into shared pool|
|Example|Website scaling up during peak hours|VM needing extra CPU for a heavy task|

#### ⚙️ App Service Plan

- Controls: CPU, memory, scaling features, and pricing tier
    
- Purpose: Defines performance level for web apps
    
- NOT for monitoring or storing code
    

---

#### 🤖 Orchestration

- Automates: Deployment of cloud services (e.g., VM, storage, networking)
    
- Uses: Templates, self-service portals
    
- Purpose: Rapid provisioning at scale
    

---

#### 💥 Enablers of On-Demand Computing

- ✅ Automation – Speeds up provisioning and teardown
    
- ✅ Virtualization – Makes hardware resources cloud-usable
    
- ❌ Autoscaling = uses on-demand, doesn’t enable it directly
    

---

#### 🧪 Penetration Testing

- Tests cloud security by simulating attacks
    
- Goal: Find exploitable vulnerabilities
    
- Not to be confused with load testing (performance)
    

---

#### 🚫 Security Is NOT a Pooled Resource

- Pooled resources:
    
    - ✅ CPU
        
    - ✅ Storage
        
    - ✅ Networking
        
- ❌ Security is a _concept_, not a measurable resource
