## 🧠 Lesson 1.6 Summary — Cloud+ (Sections 1.0 to 1.5)

### ☁️ 1.0: What is Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing provides **on-demand access** to computing resources over the internet.
    
- Key benefits: **Scalability, flexibility, cost efficiency, and remote accessibility**.
    
- Supports **on-demand computing**, elastic scaling, resource pooling, and metered usage.

### 🔧 1.1: Cloud Service Models

- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service): You manage OS, storage, and apps; provider manages hardware.
    
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service): You manage applications; provider manages the platform.
    
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service): You just use the app; provider manages everything.
    
- Includes newer services like CaaS, DBaaS, FaaS, and more.

### 🤖 1.2: Revolutionizing Technology with AI and ML

- AI and ML support **automation, predictive analytics, and intelligent cloud services**.
    
- Enables smarter services like auto-scaling, diagnostics, data processing, and content personalization.
    
- Cloud providers offer **AI toolkits and APIs** to integrate intelligence into applications.

### 🏗️ 1.3: Creating and Validating a Cloud Deployment

- Use **staging, QA, and development** environments before going live.
    
- **Autoscaling** and **load balancing** optimize performance.
    
- Tools like **RDP** and **SSH** support remote VM management.
    
- **Testing types**: Vulnerability, penetration, performance, regression, functional, usability.
    
- Monitoring and automation ensure ongoing stability and scaling.

### ✅ 1.4: Verifying System Requirements

- Validate requirements such as **regions, availability zones (AZs), edge computing**, and connectivity.
    
- **Regions** provide fault tolerance and geo-redundancy.
    
- **Availability Zones** ensure high availability within a region.
    
- **Edge computing** processes data closer to users to reduce latency.

### 🌐 1.5: Routing Issues

- **Missing routes**: Caused by misconfiguration or lack of dynamic protocol updates.
    
- **Misconfigured routes**: Wrong next-hop, black holes, or routing loops.
    
- Use `ping` and `traceroute` to test route paths.
    
- Backup routes and proper dynamic protocol configuration are essential.
