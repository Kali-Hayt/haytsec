# Lesson 1.1 – Cloud Service Models

# What is Cloud Computing?

## ☁ Definition

**Cloud computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources like  
servers, storage, databases, networking, and software — over the  
internet — with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

You don't build or maintain the physical infrastructure. Instead,  
you rent computing power from a **cloud provider** like:  
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
- Microsoft Azure  
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

---

## ⚡ Top 3 Advantages of Cloud Computing

### 1. Speed to Deploy
In the past, setting up computing resources required buying, waiting for delivery, installing, and configuring equipment.  
With cloud computing, the infrastructure is already running in the provider’s data center.  
You can host an application in **minutes**, not days or weeks.

### 2. Cost Efficiency
Cloud avoids high up-front costs of equipment purchases and support.  
You don’t buy servers — you **pay for what you use**.  
The **pay-as-you-go model** frees up your company’s cash for other needs.

### 3. Scalability & Elasticity
Cloud infrastructure grows with your needs — automatically.  
If demand increases, you scale up. If traffic drops, you scale down.  
In-house? You’d need to buy and configure more equipment.

---

## 🏢 In-House Computing (The Old Way)

**In-house computing** means:
- You own the hardware
- You build and maintain your own data center
- You hire staff to manage it

### Downsides:
- Expensive up front (capital expenses)
- Slower to scale or adapt
- Requires a dedicated team for updates, patches, and management

---

## 🔄 Cloud vs. In-House

### Cloud Computing
- Cost: Pay-as-you-go — only pay for what you use.
- Setup Time: Launch resources in minutes.
- Physical Control: No — the provider manages the hardware.
- Maintenance: Cloud provider handles updates, security, and infrastructure.

### In-House Computing
- Cost: High up-front investment in servers, networking, and facilities.
- Setup Time: Can take days or weeks to purchase and configure systems.
- Physical Control: Yes — full control over hardware and data location.
- Maintenance: Your internal IT team is responsible for everything.

---

## 🕰️ History of Computing

Before cloud:  
- Companies used massive **mainframe computers**  
- Required specialized staff and huge capital  
- Cloud evolved from this model to offer flexible, on-demand computing

---

## 🛠 Real-World Scenario

You spin up a **Kali Linux VM** in AWS to practice Nmap scans.  
- Fast, disposable, scalable  
- You don’t manage physical servers — just the instance

---

## 🔑 Key Terms

- **Cloud computing**: Renting IT resources like servers, storage, and networking over the internet instead of owning physical hardware.
- **On-demand**: Access resources instantly whenever needed, without waiting for setup or approval.
- **Scalability**: The ability to increase capacity (like CPU, memory, storage) to handle growing demand.
- **Elasticity**: Automatically grow or shrink resources based on workload (like auto-scaling up during high traffic).
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use — no up-front hardware costs.
- **In-house computing**: You buy, own, and maintain your own servers and data center infrastructure.
- **Mainframe**: Large, centralized computers used before cloud computing became popular — expensive and complex to manage.



## 🌀 Virtualization, Infrastructure, and Hypervisors

Cloud computing is made possible by **virtualization**, which allows one large physical server to run many small, separate computers called **virtual machines (VMs)**.

Each VM has its own operating system, storage, memory, and network access — but it's actually just a software-based copy running on shared physical hardware.

This is all controlled by a special piece of software called a **hypervisor**.

---

## 🧠 Hypervisor Explained Simply

A **hypervisor** is like a landlord managing an apartment building.

- The **physical server** is the apartment building.
- Each **virtual machine (VM)** is a separate apartment or office.
- The **hypervisor** is the landlord or manager.

Each VM is isolated — just like tenants. They can’t see into each other's apartments, but they all share the same building (hardware).

The hypervisor hands out resources like CPU, RAM, and storage to each VM, and makes sure they stay separated and secure.

---

## 🔎 Type 1 vs. Type 2 Hypervisors

### Type 1 (Bare-metal)
- Installed directly on the physical server with **no OS underneath**.
- Super efficient and fast.
- Used in **cloud data centers** and enterprise environments.
- Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (bare-metal), KVM.

This is what **AWS and Azure** use behind the scenes.

### Type 2 (Hosted)
- Installed **on top of an operating system** like Windows or macOS.
- More flexible but slower than Type 1.
- Used for home labs, testing, learning environments.
- Examples: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels.

This is what **you run on your laptop** when testing Kali Linux or building local labs.

---

## 🧱 Where the Physical Hardware Lives

All the real physical hardware (servers, drives, switches) lives inside **data centers** owned by cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

When you launch a VM in AWS, it’s hosted on **a real physical machine** in one of their data centers. You don’t know exactly where — the provider hides the physical location and details.

Cloud providers handle:
- Server maintenance and upgrades
- Power and cooling
- Physical security (like guards and cameras)

You only manage your **virtual environment**.

---

## 🏗️ What is Infrastructure?

**Infrastructure** is everything that supports computing systems — both physical and virtual.

That includes:
- Servers (bare-metal and virtual)
- Networking (IP addresses, firewalls, switches, routing)
- Storage (local disks, cloud storage, backups)
- Power, cooling, cables, and data center buildings
- Hypervisors and virtualization platforms

In cloud computing, you're **renting infrastructure** instead of building and owning it. This is called **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**.
---
## 🌐 Virtual Networking (a.k.a. Private Cloud Networking)

Cloud networking is virtual too. You build your own private network using:
- VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds)
- Subnets
- Security groups
- Route tables
- Virtual firewalls and NAT

This lets your VMs communicate securely — even across regions or availability zones — just like they’re in the same office LAN.

There are no cables — it’s all **software-defined networking (SDN)**.

---

## ❓ “You Won’t Know Where You Are”

In cloud computing:
- You don’t see the physical server.
- You don’t know the rack or switch.
- You don’t touch anything physical.

You just get control over:
- Virtual machines
- Your storage
- Your network
- Your firewall rules

The provider handles the rest. This keeps the cloud secure, scalable, and flexible.

## 🔗 Peering

Peering is when two or more networks — like cloud providers, ISPs, or content delivery networks — connect directly to share traffic without going through a third-party internet provider.

This direct connection makes data move faster, reduces delays, lowers costs, and increases reliability.

---

### Why Peering Matters in the Cloud

Peering is used to:
- Reduce latency (faster data delivery)
- Improve performance (less congestion)
- Lower transit costs (no middlemen)
- Increase reliability (multiple routes available)

Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud use peering to connect with other major networks, data centers, and CDN services.

---

### Types of Peering

- **Public peering**: Happens at internet exchange points (IXPs). Many networks share one big public connection to trade traffic.
- **Private peering**: A dedicated, private connection between two networks for high-priority or high-volume data.

---

### Real-World Example

If Microsoft and Google set up a private peering connection:
- Emails from Outlook to Gmail flow directly.
- No slow public routing.
- Faster, more reliable service.

---

## 📦 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Peering

CDNs like **Cloudflare** and **Akamai** use peering extensively to move large volumes of traffic quickly across the globe.

- **Cloudflare** protects and accelerates websites using caching, DNS, and security services. You’ve used it any time you saw “Checking your browser…” before a site loads.
- **Akamai** serves high-bandwidth content like software updates, streaming media, and gaming downloads for huge companies.

Both CDNs peer with cloud providers and ISPs to make sure content gets delivered from the nearest possible location.

---

## 🧠 DNS and Peering Work Together

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet’s address book. It helps your computer find the **nearest server** hosting what you’re asking for — like a video or a website.

Here’s how it works:
- You click a video on YouTube.
- Your device uses DNS to find the closest CDN edge server with that video.
- The CDN streams the video from that location.
- Peering ensures the traffic takes a **direct, fast route** to you.

Without DNS and peering, content would be slow, delayed, or possibly even blocked during peak usage.

---

## 🧠 Final Insight

Peering, DNS, and CDNs all work together behind the scenes to:
- Make internet traffic move fast
- Keep data reliable and available
- Improve the cloud experience for users and apps

## 🌐 Peering and Cloud Connectivity Services

### 🔗 VPC Peering Connection

- VPC peering is a secure, private network link between two **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)**.
- It allows easy communication between VPCs **as if they were in the same network**.
- No need for internet gateways, VPNs, or NATs.
- Enables **low-latency, high-bandwidth communication**.
- Used for secure interdepartmental communication, multi-region designs, and hybrid setups.
- **Non-transitive**: if VPC A connects to B, and B connects to C, A cannot talk to C.
- For more complex routing, use a **Transit Gateway** or **AWS PrivateLink**.

---

## 🔄 Internet Gateway vs. NAT Gateway

### 🔓 Internet Gateway
- Used for **public subnets** and **public-facing instances**.
- Assigns a **public IP address** and allows **bidirectional internet access**.
- Best for web servers or APIs that need to be reachable from the internet.

### 🔐 NAT Gateway
- Used for **private subnets** to access the internet **outbound only**.
- Keeps instances secure (they have no public IP).
- Lets internal services like databases:
  - Download updates
  - Access external APIs
  - Communicate outward securely
- Blocks all **inbound** connections unless specifically configured.

---

## 🧠 Lambda Function (Serverless)

- AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service**.
- You write code that runs **in response to events** — like S3 uploads, API calls, or database changes.
- **No servers to manage** — AWS handles scaling and infrastructure.
- Supports Python, Node.js, Java, and more.
- You only pay for the compute time used.
- Ideal for:
  - Automation
  - Stream processing
  - Event-driven microservices

---

## 🧭 Transit Gateway

- A **Transit Gateway** connects many VPCs and on-premises networks through one central hub.
- Simplifies network architecture by reducing the number of connections.
- Scales better than VPC peering for large environments.
- Supports **multi-region** and **hybrid cloud** setups.
- Uses **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** for dynamic routing.
- Centralizes traffic routing and policy enforcement.

---

## 🔒 NAT Gateway (Detailed)

- NAT = **Network Address Translation**.
- Used in **private subnets** to access the internet **outbound only**.
- Prevents direct inbound traffic from the internet.
- Auto-scales and provides high availability.
- Common use cases:
  - Private EC2 instances downloading security updates
  - Internal services calling external APIs
  - Hybrid cloud setups with secure outbound access
  
#### 🔧 **Technical Behavior**

- A **NAT Gateway must reside in a public subnet** and be associated with an **Elastic IP** to route traffic to the internet.
    
- Instances in private subnets use a **route table** that points **0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway** for internet-bound traffic.
    
- It **only supports IPv4** — for IPv6, AWS uses an **Egress-Only Internet Gateway**.
    
#### 🧠 **Certification Insight (Cloud+ or AWS Certified Questions)**

- NAT Gateway is **managed by AWS** — you don't maintain it.
    
- **Not stateful** like security groups — it's purely for **outbound access** translation.
    
- **Elasticity**: AWS automatically scales it up based on traffic.
    
- **One NAT Gateway per Availability Zone recommended** for high availability.
    
#### 💸 **Pricing Reminder**

- Billed **per-hour** + **per GB of data processed**.
    
- For smaller setups, a **NAT Instance** (EC2-based alternative) may be more cost-effective but requires manual maintenance.
