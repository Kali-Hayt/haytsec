**Question 1**

**Q:** Harold is creating a disaster recovery plan based on corporate requirements that service be restored in the shortest amount of time possible if the primary cloud data center is down. What disaster recovery model would you suggest to Harold?

- ☐ Recovery time objective  
- ✅ Hot site  
- ☐ Cold site  
- ☐ I don't know

**Explanation:**  
A **hot site** is a fully redundant, synchronized backup data center that allows for the quickest possible restoration of service, minimizing downtime.

**Question 4**

**Q:** Which disaster recovery measurement defines when you can expect your systems to be back online after an outage?

- ☐ Warm site  
- ☐ Recovery point objective  
- ✅ Recovery time objective  
- ☐ I don't know

**Question 5**

**Q:** Which disaster recovery measurement defines the amount of lost data after a recovery?

- ☐ Hot site  
- ✅ Recovery point objective  
- ☐ Recovery time objective  
- ☐ I don't know

**Explanation:**  
The **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** specifies the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time, indicating how much data may be lost during recovery.

---
**Question 6**

**Q:** What is long-term storage of cloud data called?

- ☐ Recovery point objective  
- ✅ Archive  
- ☐ Orphaned resources  
- ☐ I don't know

**Explanation:**  
**Archive** refers to the long-term storage of inactive or infrequently accessed cloud data.
