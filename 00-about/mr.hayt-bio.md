# 🧑‍💻 Mr. Hayt – Founder of HaytSec

## 🏢 About Me

I'm the **founder of HaytSec**, a fictional-but-functional cybersecurity company built to simulate the operations of a real-world cloud security team.  

At present, I'm a **cybersecurity student at San Diego City College**, actively studying to earn the five foundational CompTIA certifications. But HaytSec isn’t just an academic project — it’s a personal mission to bridge the gap between certification theory and operational reality.

Through this project, I’m developing secure AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), writing enforcement bots, and building tools that I believe real companies could use. Every script, every policy, and every procedure in HaytSec reflects a hands-on, professional approach to enterprise security.

## 📚 Study Approach

Every certification module becomes a live simulation. Every topic is written down, version-controlled, tested, tagged, and treated like part of a company-wide operation.  

This vault isn’t just notes- it’s my R&D lab, my documentation repo, and my company handbook.
