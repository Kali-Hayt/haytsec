### 📜 Company Lore

HaytSec began as one student’s warpath through the cybersecurity world — not by watching, but by building. It wasn’t enough to study cloud security or memorize frameworks. The only way forward was to simulate the real thing.

So HaytSec was born: a one-person security company forged in virtual infrastructure, automated deployments, threat modeling, and script-driven ops. Every lesson became a test. Every note became documentation. Every mistake became a log entry.

From cloud builds to compliance policies, HaytSec is where theory becomes systems — and where systems get stress-tested.

### 🎯 Mission

> **To architect secure systems from scratch, simulate enterprise-grade infrastructure, and automate defensive strategy — all while documenting everything.**

HaytSec is built on the belief that cybersecurity is _practical_. That you learn more by deploying a hardened cloud environment than by reading about it. That if you want to understand the threat landscape, you need to walk in it.

This project is not a lab. It's a long-term simulation of a company in the making — with standards, automation, structure, and strategy.

### 💡 Principles

- **Security is an architecture problem**
- **Documentation is a form of defense**
- **Tools should be self-explaining and self-healing**
- **Good ops are boring, but good failures teach fast**
- **Learn by doing. Share by documenting. Improve by breaking.**
