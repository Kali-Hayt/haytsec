## 🌤️ Morning Journal

I am feeling solid today and confident in my preparation for the Network+ exam scheduled for tomorrow evening. My focus will be on completing drills for IPv4 subnetting, IPv6, and MAC addressing, while alternating with CompTIA video review throughout the day. To maintain focus and avoid burnout, I will take short breaks as needed, then return to push forward with maximum effort.

## 🌙 Early–Late Evening Journal

I have achieved understanding how to do subnetting for Network+ since this morning and performed drills to build muscle memory. I also reviewed and took notes from CompTIA Network+ videos to prepare for the exam.  

Later in the evening, I rushed through the final lab exam for my course after mistakenly thinking it was due at midnight. I realized afterward that I had more time than I thought, but still managed to complete it under pressure — and passed!
