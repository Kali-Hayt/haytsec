# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-07-27

## 🔥 Focus of the Day  

Today’s focus is to close out the Cloud+ course for the summer by taking the final exam, then prepare a Networking+ study plan to start on Monday. After that, I plan to enjoy some well-earned free time by working on the HaytSec project, setting up my own automation environment, and learning new tools like VS Code or Vim. Whether it’s scripting system routines or refining my terminal workflow, today is about finishing strong and investing in what comes next.

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

I’m feeling confident heading into the Cloud+ exam today after a focused warm-up review. It feels good knowing I pushed through and completed the entire certification prep course in just seven weeks. That momentum drives me forward — I’m excited to keep learning, explore new tools, and take on whatever challenges come next.
