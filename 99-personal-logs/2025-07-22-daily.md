## 🧠 Notes & Learnings

### 🔹 TCP vs. UDP  
- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented (3-way handshake), used by HTTPS, FTP, SSH.  
- **UDP**: Unreliable, connectionless, faster—used by DNS queries, VoIP, video streaming.  

### 🔹 TCP Handshake  
1. **SYN** – Client: “Hey, I want to start talking.”  
2. **SYN-ACK** – Server: “Sure, I’m listening.”  
3. **ACK** – Client: “Cool, let’s do this.”  
➡ That’s the "handshake"—required before sending application data.  

### 🔹 TCP Flag Values (seen in Wireshark)  
- `0x002` – SYN  
- `0x012` – SYN-ACK  
- `0x010` – ACK  

### 🔹 Ports to Know  
- **TCP 443** – HTTPS  
- **TCP 80** – HTTP  
- **TCP 22** – SSH  
- **UDP 53** – DNS  
- **UDP 69** – TFTP  
- **TCP 20/21** – FTP (data/control)  

### 🔹 DHCP Process (DORA)  
1. **Discover** – Client says “Anyone out there?”  
2. **Offer** – Server responds “Here’s an IP.”  
3. **Request** – Client replies “I’ll take it.”  
4. **ACK** – Server confirms lease: “It’s yours.”  

### 🔹 CIDR Quick Tip  
- `/24` → 255.255.255.0 → 256 total addresses  
- `/48` → Typically seen in IPv6 (massive address space)  
- IP like `192.168.0.34` is in `192.168.0.0/24` if subnet is 255.255.255.0  

### 🔹 Useful Linux Commands  
- `ip a` – View IP config  
- `netstat -tunlp` – Show open ports and services  
- `vncserver` – Start remote graphical session

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

I made strong progress on my Network+ coursework yesterday and built solid momentum.  
Today is about finishing the remaining assignments for Lessons 6 and 7.  
I’m staying focused and cutting out distractions to get everything done and stay balanced.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection  

Today I decided to move at my own pace.  

After staying up late last night, I took the morning to rest, which helped me regain focus in the afternoon.  
Even with the delayed start, I managed to complete Lessons 6.1 and 6.2, and I’m now on 6.3.  

I’m wrapping up earlier tonight so I can wake up refreshed and hit tomorrow’s study session with a sharp mind.  
My goal is to finish the rest of Lesson 6 and, if possible, knock out all of Lesson 7 as well.  

Momentum is still going strong—just managing it wisely.
