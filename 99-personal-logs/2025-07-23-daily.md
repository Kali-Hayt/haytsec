## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  
  
I'm feeling grounded and ready to make solid progress on my networking assignments today. Yesterday moved at a slower pace—I gave myself room to rest and recover from some mental exhaustion. That reset helped. I'm feeling clear-headed now and ready to lock in. Later this evening, I plan to shift focus back to HaytSec and move forward on some key project work.
