# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-07-19

## 🔥 Focus of the Day
- Finish Network+ assignments (due July 21)
- Light subnetting practice
- Prep mentally for evening AWS Phase 1 tasks

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- [x] Review subnetting and CIDR math  
- [ ] Complete all assigned Network+ lesson tasks (readings, lab, quiz)
- [ ] Organize notes in `05-certification-notes/Network+`  
- [ ] Start AWS account setup tonight (Phase 1 from haytsec-aws-plan)

---

## ✍️ Journal / Reflection  
Feeling a bit overloaded with the dual demands of cert study and building HaytSec. Need to balance rigor with rest.  

Today’s focus is light but effective progress—no burning out. AWS work begins tonight after a successful Network+ sprint.

## ✅ What I Completed  
- Completed IPv4 troubleshooting lab (4.4.6)  
- Practiced using traceroute, ping, whois tools  
- Reviewed subnet mask to CIDR relationships  
- Understood bit weighting (128–1) for subnetting  
- Completed notes and drill practice for CIDR ranges and binary conversions

---

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings  
- Bit weights (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1) clarify how subnet masks convert from binary to decimal.  
- CIDR / subnet mask → defines block size → defines IP range.  
- IPs in different subnets (e.g., 0–63 vs 64–127) can't communicate without a router.  
- Binary practice helps make subnet math fast and automatic.  
- Subnetting requires repetition—not memorization, but pattern recognition.
