## 🔥 Focus of the Day
- Finish Network+ assignments (due July 21)
- Light subnetting practice
- Prep mentally for evening AWS Phase 1 tasks

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- [x] Review subnetting and CIDR math  
- [x] Complete all assigned Network+ lesson tasks (readings, lab, quiz)
- [x] Organize notes in `05-certification-notes/Network+`  
- [x] Start AWS account setup tonight (Phase 1 from haytsec-aws-plan)

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection
Feeling a bit overloaded with the dual demands of cert study and building HaytSec. Need to balance rigor with rest.  

Today’s focus is light but effective progress—no burning out. AWS work begins tonight after a successful Network+ sprint.

## ✅ What I Completed  
- Completed IPv4 troubleshooting lab (4.4.6)  
- Practiced traceroute, ping, and whois in Linux  
- Understood CIDR-to-subnet mask mapping  
- Learned binary weight logic for subnetting (128 to 1)  
- Completed CIDR drill notes and bit math practice  
- Documented everything clearly in Obsidian 

---

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings  
- CIDR notation controls how many host IPs exist in a subnet.  
- Bit weights (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1) help convert binary subnet masks.  
- Subnets like 192.168.1.0/26 range from 0–63, 64–127, etc.  
- IPs in different subnet ranges can't talk directly without a router.  
- Binary is power-of-two math—pattern recognition matters more than memorization.  
- Practice and repetition are key—write, calculate, repeat.

## ✍️ Evening- Journal / Reflection 
Networking+ work wasn’t full-day, but I got quality hours in. CIDR and subnet math finally started to click.  

Tonight: shift gears to HaytSec.  
Tomorrow: full focus on completing 4.5–7.5 before deadline. Stay sharp.
