## ✅ Cloud+ Core Concepts Recap (from Lessons 1.0–1.6)

### 🛠️ What You Need to Know

#### 🔌 Cloud Computing = Utility Model

- Functions like water/electricity: pay-as-you-go
    
- Enables **on-demand, scalable** access to shared IT resources
    

#### ☁️ Cloud Service Models

- **SaaS** (Software as a Service) – e.g., Gmail, Salesforce
    
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) – e.g., Google App Engine, Heroku
    
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) – e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VM
    
- Also includes: **CaaS, DaaS, DBaaS, FaaS**, etc.
    
- Know **how to differentiate** between service models
    

#### 🚛 Cloud Delivery Models

- **Public Cloud** – Shared infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure)
    
- **Private Cloud** – Internal or organization-specific
    
- **Community Cloud** – Shared by organizations with common goals
    
- **Hybrid Cloud** – Combines two or more of the above
    

#### 🧱 Cloud Components

- Application
    
- Automation
    
- Compute
    
- Networking
    
- **Security**
    
- **Storage**
    

#### 🏊 Resource Pooling

- Resources are **abstracted from physical hardware**
    
- Dynamically assigned from a **shared pool**
    
- Ensures **multi-tenant separation**
    

#### 🚀 Autoscaling (Elasticity)

- Automatically adjusts resources (CPUs, RAM, storage)
    
- Triggered by workload or schedule
    
- Enables scaling **on-demand or "on the fly"**
    
- Example: More EC2 instances spin up as traffic increases
    

#### 🌍 Regions & Availability Zones

- **Region** = Geographic area (e.g., us-west-1)
    
- **Availability Zone (AZ)** = Physical data center(s) in a region
    
- AZs = Redundancy and failover
    
- Large cloud operations separate **critical systems** across AZs

## 📚 Cloud+ Lesson 1.7 – Glossary (Key Terms)

### 🔁 **Autoscaling**

Automatically adds/removes cloud resources based on demand.

### 💵 **AWS Pricing Calculator**

Tool to estimate costs of AWS services based on usage.

### ⚡ **AWS Lambda Function**

Serverless compute to run code in response to events — no server management needed.

### 💽 **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**

Spinning disk storage used for long-term data retention.

### 🌐 **Availability Zones**

Isolated data centers inside cloud regions for redundancy and high availability.

### ☁️ **Cloud Computing**

On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with utility-style billing.

### 🛍️ **Cloud Service Provider**

Company that sells computing services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

### 🏢 **Colocation**

Shared data center space provided by a third-party vendor.

### 🧠 **CPU Affinity**

Pins a processing thread to a specific CPU core to improve performance.

### 🧪 **Development Environments**

Used for creating/testing apps. Common in DevOps pipelines.

### 🔒 **Hypervisor Affinity**

Ensures VMs don’t run on the same physical host for resilience.

### ⚖️ **Load Balancing**

Spreads traffic across servers to ensure performance and uptime.

### 📲 **On-Demand**

Users can provision cloud resources instantly through self-service portals.

### 🛡️ **Penetration Testing**

Tests security by simulating attacks to find exploitable weaknesses.

### 🧪 **Performance Testing**

Measures response under load/stress to evaluate system capacity.

### 🚀 **Production Environment**

The live system where real users interact with applications.

### 📤 **Replication**

Stores duplicate data across multiple systems for redundancy.

### 🏊 **Resource Pooling**

Shared pool of computing resources allocated dynamically to tenants.

### 🖼️ **Snapshot**

A frozen state (image) of a VM or system for rollback or backup.

### 🔐 **Secure Shell (SSH)**

Encrypted remote terminal access protocol (Port 22).

### 🌎 **Ubiquitous Access**

Cloud can be accessed from anywhere via any device.

### 🧊 **Virtualization**

Creates virtual versions of hardware so multiple OSes/services can run on one system.

### 🕵️ **Vulnerability Testing**

Scans systems for security flaws that can be exploited.

### 🌿 **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

Simplifies app deployment and scaling in AWS.

### 🚪 **NAT Gateway**

Allows private instances to access the internet without accepting inbound traffic.

### 🛰️ **Edge Computing**

Runs workloads closer to the user for speed and performance.

### ⚙️ **App Service Plan**

Azure service that defines pricing and performance tier for hosting web apps.

### 🧠 **Function App**

Azure service to run serverless functions — like AWS Lambda.

### 🧭 **Application Gateway**

OSI Layer 7 firewall that filters and routes traffic to back-end apps.
