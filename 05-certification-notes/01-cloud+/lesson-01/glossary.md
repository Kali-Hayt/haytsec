# 📘 Cloud+ Lesson 1 Glossary

## 🔧 A

- **App Service Plan**  
  A service that defines the compute resources and pricing tier for hosting web apps, mobile backends, and APIs in cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure.

- **Application Gateway**  
  A specialized service in the OSI model (application layer) that takes requests from a client and hands them to the backend application.

- **Autoscaling**  
  A cloud feature that automatically adds and removes resources based on demand.

- **Availability Zones**  
  Isolated locations within data center regions that public cloud services originate and operate from.

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**  
  A fully managed service that simplifies deployment, scaling, and management of web apps and services.

- **AWS Lambda Function**  
  A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.

- **AWS Pricing Calculator**  
  Tool to estimate the prices of AWS services based on individual usage needs.

## 🌐 C

- **Cloud Computing**  
  Outsourcing of data center operations, applications, or part of operations to a cloud provider.

- **Cloud Service Provider**  
  A company that sells and hosts cloud computing systems to consumers.

- **Colocation**  
  A shared data center operation offered by a service provider.

- **CPU Affinity**  
  Binding a processing thread to a specific core instead of letting the hypervisor dynamically allocate it.

## 👨‍💻 D

- **Development Environments**  
  Used by programmers and DevOps to create and test new cloud-based services and applications.

## 🌍 E

- **Edge Computing**  
  Brings computing resources near the data source, instead of relying on centralized servers.

## 🔁 F

- **Function App**  
  A cloud service for serverless functions triggered by events, often used for automation and microservices.

## 💽 H

- **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**  
  Traditional spinning magnetic platter storage.

- **Hypervisor Affinity**  
  Rules that ensure VMs don’t run on the same host, improving resiliency.

## 🌐 L

- **Load Balancing**  
  Distributes traffic across redundant servers to improve availability and scalability.

## 🌐 N

- **NAT Gateway**  
  Allows private instances in a subnet to access the internet or AWS services securely.

## 🛡️ P

- **Penetration Testing**  
  Tests your cloud access to find exploitable vulnerabilities.

- **Performance Testing**  
  Tests how well your app or system performs under demand/load.

- **Production Environment**  
  Where live, in-use applications run for end users.

## 🔁 R

- **Replication**  
  The process of copying data across multiple systems for redundancy and disaster recovery.

- **Resource Pooling**  
  Grouping compute resources into a pool available to multiple tenants.

## 🔒 S

- **Secure Shell (SSH)**  
  A secure command-line interface used to remotely access systems.

- **Snapshot**  
  An instance-in-time image used for backups or rollbacks.

## 🌍 U

- **Ubiquitous Access**  
  Ability to access cloud services from anywhere in the network.

## 🧱 V

- **Virtualization**  
  Hardware abstraction that enables multiple OSs and services to run on the same physical machine.

- **Vulnerability Testing**  
  Scans your cloud deployment for weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
