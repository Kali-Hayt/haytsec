- **Ansible**  
    A powerful open-source tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
    
- **Asynchronous replication**  
    Writes data to the primary storage location and later sends copies to remote replicas. There may be a delay before the backup site becomes consistent (store-and-forward design).
    
- **Audit trail**  
    A controlled record of financial transactions that provides an unambiguous, auditable history of data processing, alteration, or entry.
    
- **AWS CodeCommit**  
    A fully managed source control service hosting secure and scalable Git repositories.
    
- **Cloud object storage**  
    Storage data (e.g., a common file) paired with metadata and combined into a storage object.
    
- **CPU wait time**  
    Time a process/thread waits to access a CPU for processing.
    
- **Data center**  
    A facility housing computing systems.
    
- **Ephemeral storage**  
    Storage that doesn't retain data if the virtual machine is removed or deleted.
    
- **Extended metadata**  
    A detailed list of data attached to a file, used for index schemas.
    
- **Fault tolerance**  
    A system's ability to remain operational despite a degradation or failure of components.
    
- **Git (Global Information Tracker)**  
    A distributed version control system (VCS) for efficient collaboration and version tracking in software projects.
    
- **Grafana**  
    An open-source tool for interactive visualization and monitoring real-time data from multiple sources.
    
- **Group-Based Access Control (GBAC)**  
    Access management based on user groups instead of individual accounts.
    
- **High availability**  
    The ability of a system or resource to remain available after a failure.
    
- **Intrusion detection system (IDS)**  
    Detects suspicious activity on a network in real time by passively monitoring traffic and generating alerts.
    
- **Intrusion prevention system (IPS)**  
    Similar to IDS but actively shuts down the intrusion based on pre-defined rules.
    
- **Jenkins**  
    An open-source server used in CI/CD pipelines for automation and deployment.
    
- **Memory ballooning**  
    A hypervisor feature allowing memory to be reclaimed from VMs and reallocated dynamically.
    
- **Metadata**  
    Identifying data used to describe other data in storage systems (e.g., file headers, sectors).
    
- **Obfuscation**  
    A technique to hide or obscure data to complicate access or understanding, commonly used in cloud security.
    
- **OAuth 2.0**  
    An industry-standard authorization framework for secure access without shared credentials.
    
- **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**  
    A method to combine multiple physical disks to achieve redundancy and improve performance.
    
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**  
    A document that outlines uptime guarantees, performance expectations, and penalties for failure.
    
- **Synchronous replication**  
    Real-time data copying to a remote facility; replicas are updated simultaneously for consistency.
    
- **Templates**  
    Software-based representations of system configurations. Used to build cloud systems quickly and consistently.
    
- **Terraform**  
    An open-source Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool from HashiCorp for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
    
- **Thick provisioning**  
    Allocates the entire requested virtual storage at disk creation time.
    
- **Thin provisioning**  
    Allocates only the minimum required storage initially and expands as needed.
