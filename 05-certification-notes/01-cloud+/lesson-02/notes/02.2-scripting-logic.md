### 🔁 **Scripting Logic Overview**

- Scripting logic is the brain behind automation—used to build routines, tasks, and tools.
    
- Important whether you’re writing simple scripts or advanced applications.
    
- This section covers:
    
    - Variables
        
    - Conditionals
        
    - Operators
        
    - Data types
        
    - Functions
        
    - And even **how Generative AI** fits into scripting!

### 🧠 **Variables**

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Name-Based Storage** – Every variable has a unique name (identifier).
    
2. **Data Assignment** – You can change the value during script execution.
    
3. **Memory Allocation** – The system holds values temporarily during use.
    

**Example (Python-style):**
username = "Alice"     # String
age = 25               # Integer
price = 99.99          # Floating-point number

**Takeaway:**  
Variables allow scripts to react to changing data. Instead of hardcoding values, we can adjust dynamically—just like passing arguments to a command in terminal.

---
### 🔀 **Conditionals**

Conditionals let scripts _make decisions_ based on input or changing conditions—so they can behave differently depending on what happens.

---

### 🔑 **Key Conditional Statements** (Python syntax shown):

- **`if`** – Runs a block of code **if the condition is true**.
    
- **`if-else`** – Adds a backup block if the condition is **false**.
    
- **`elif`** – Adds more conditions to check **in order** (like else-if).
    
- **`switch/case`** – (used in other languages, like C/JavaScript) for **clean multi-option logic**.

### 🧪 Example:
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")
➡️ Output:
Grade: B
### 💡Why it matters:

- Adds **decision-making power** to scripts.
    
- Makes automation **reactive** to real input.
    
- Cleaner than writing tons of nested `if`s.
    
- Key to **error checking**, **workflow branching**, and **dynamic output**.

### ⚙️ **Operators in Scripting**

Operators are the **symbols** that perform actions on variables and values—basically, how scripts _do things_, _compare things_, and _make decisions_.

---

### 🔢 **Types of Operators (with examples)**

#### **1. Arithmetic Operators**

Used for math:

- `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide)
    
- `%` (modulus/remainder)
    
- `**` (exponentiation)
    

#### **2. Comparison Operators**

Used to compare values:

- `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater), `<` (less), `>=`, `<=`
    

#### **3. Logical Operators**

Used in conditionals:

- `and`, `or`, `not`
    

#### **4. Assignment Operators**

Used to assign or update values:

- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
    

#### **5. Bitwise Operators**

Used in binary math:

- `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`

### 💻 Example:
x = 10
y = 5

sum = x + y        # 15
is_greater = x > y # True

### 🧠 Why It Matters:

- Operators let scripts **calculate, compare, and react**.
    
- You’ll use them in **every script** you write—from setting prices to building logic trees.
    
- Mastering operators = mastering **control over data**.

### 🧱 **Data Types in Scripting**

Data types define _what kind of value_ a variable can hold. Without 'em, your script's just chaos in curly braces.

---

### 📦 **Common Data Types (with examples)**

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Integer|Whole numbers|`42`|
|Floating-Point|Decimal numbers|`3.14`|
|String|Text data|`"Hello, World!"`|
|Boolean|True/False logic|`True`, `False`|
|List/Array|Ordered list of items|`[1, 2, 3]`|
|Dictionary|Key-value pairs|`{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`|

💻 Example in Python:
my_string = "Python"
my_number = 42
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}
### 🧠 Why It Matters:

- Knowing your data types = fewer errors, less RAM drama.
    
- Efficient memory use.
    
- Clean logic and predictable behavior.
    
- Your script won’t crash over something like `"7" + 3`.
