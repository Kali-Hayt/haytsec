## 🧠 Lesson 2.4 – Application Migration Strategies

---

### 📍 Overview

As companies grow, their infrastructure must evolve to stay **competitive**, **scalable**, and **cost-effective**. Cloud migration is one of the most powerful modernization tools—but choosing the _right_ migration strategy is key.

This lesson covers the **6 Rs** of application migration—each with its own use cases, trade-offs, and benefits:

### 🔧 The Six Migration Strategies (a.k.a. the 6 Rs)

|Strategy|Also Known As|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Rehost**|"Lift and Shift"|Move app with **minimal to no changes**. Fastest migration type.|
|**Replatform**|"Lift, Tinker, and Shift"|Make **small changes**, like moving from on-prem DB to cloud DB.|
|**Refactor**|"Re-architect"|**Redesign** the app to be cloud-native. Requires dev effort.|
|**Repurchase**|Switch to SaaS|Buy a **replacement app** (e.g., Salesforce instead of internal CRM).|
|**Retire**|Decommission|Shut down unused or obsolete apps.|
|**Retain**|Keep as-is|Leave app on-premises temporarily or permanently.|

---

### ⚙️ Rehost – “Lift and Shift”

**Definition:**  
Rehosting is the process of moving an application from a traditional on-premises environment to the cloud **without modifying the core code or architecture**. You’re basically taking the app as-is and dropping it into a virtual machine or container in a cloud provider like AWS or Azure.

It’s often called **“Lift and Shift”** because you're lifting the app out of its current server and shifting it to the cloud—no frills, no rebuilds.

---

#### ✅ Advantages of Rehosting

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Speed**|Because no code changes are required, the migration can happen **quickly**, making this ideal when time is critical (e.g., data center shutdowns).|
|**Cost-Efficiency**|Since you avoid time-consuming development or testing, the **initial costs** are much lower than other strategies.|
|**Familiarity**|The app behaves exactly as it did before. No need to retrain staff or redesign processes—it’s a **“plug and play” move** in many cases.|
#### ⚠️ Challenges of Rehosting

|Challenge|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Underutilization of Cloud Benefits**|Apps moved without changes may not take advantage of **cloud-native features** like autoscaling, managed services, or automation. They’re running in the cloud, but not thriving in it.|
|**Potential Performance Problems**|Legacy applications that weren’t designed for cloud infrastructure might run **slower** or inefficiently in a cloud environment.|
|**Technical Debt**|By not reworking or modernizing the app, you risk dragging along **old, inefficient code** and limitations—basically carrying old problems into a new environment.|
### 📦 When to Use Rehosting

- ✅ You have a **tight deadline** and need quick migration
    
- ✅ You plan to **modernize later** but not now
    
- ✅ You’re running legacy apps that are hard to rebuild
    
- ✅ You want a **low-risk migration** with minimal disruption
    

> 🔁 Rehost is like moving your old couch into a new apartment: it fits, it works, but it might not match the new space—and it doesn’t recline like the new ones do.

### 🛠️ Replatform – “Lift, Tinker, and Shift”

**Definition:**  
Replatforming is when you move an app to the cloud, but **make minor changes** to improve performance or compatibility. Think of it as upgrading parts of the engine during a car move—**you’re not rebuilding**, but you’re not doing a straight copy either.

It’s like Rehosting with some optimization. Common tweaks include:

- Switching to a **managed cloud database**
    
- Updating the **runtime environment**
    
- Using **cloud-native OS options**
    

---

#### ✅ Advantages of Replatforming

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Moderate Improvement**|Moving to managed services (e.g., AWS RDS instead of your on-prem SQL server) brings **better performance** without overhauling code.|
|**Cost Effectiveness**|Still cheaper than full refactoring—**some value without big dev costs**.|
|**Rapid Migration**|Much faster than re-architecting—**quick wins** for modest cloud gains.|
#### ⚠️ Challenges of Replatforming

| Challenge                  | Explanation                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Limited Gains**          | Improvements are **incremental**, not revolutionary. You’ll see **some speed or scaling**, but not full cloud-native power. |
| **Partial Cloud Benefits** | You might miss out on **autoscaling**, **containerization**, or **microservices** if your changes aren’t deep enough.       |
### 📦 When to Use Replatforming

- You want **some cloud advantages** but not a full rebuild
    
- Your app works fine but could use **a tune-up**
    
- You have dev time to tweak small things like database or OS
    
- You’re migrating under a **tight budget or timeline**

🧠 Think of it like switching your app from a personal garage to a managed service shop—**you’ll run smoother**, but you didn’t rebuild the whole car.

### 🧱 Re-architect – Full Redesign for Cloud-Native

**Definition:**  
Re-architecting (or Refactoring) means **completely redesigning** the app to take full advantage of **cloud-native features** like microservices, autoscaling, and serverless. You’re not just lifting and shifting—you’re building **for** the cloud from the ground up.

It’s the **most complex and resource-heavy** strategy—but also the one with the **highest long-term payoff**.
#### ✅ Advantages of Re-architecting

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Cloud-Native Benefits**|Full use of **scalability**, **autoscaling**, **containers**, **microservices**, and **serverless** tech.|
|**Future-Proofing**|Sets the foundation for **modern DevOps**, CI/CD pipelines, and evolving tech stacks.|
|**Better Performance**|Rebuilt apps can run **faster, leaner, and smarter** than legacy versions. You’re optimizing, not just surviving.|
#### ⚠️ Challenges of Re-architecting

|Challenge|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Time and Cost**|This is **not a weekend project**. It requires **significant time, money, and skilled developers**.|
|**Disruption**|Users may face **downtime or performance issues** during the rebuild and cutover. Risk must be managed carefully.|
### 🧠 When to Choose Re-architecting

- You’re **modernizing a critical app** for long-term use
    
- Your app **can’t scale or perform well** in its current form
    
- You have **resources and time** to invest in full redesign
    
- You’re ready to **commit to cloud-native architecture** and evolve with the tech

### 🧍 Retain – Keep It On-Prem (Do Not Migrate)

**Definition:**  
To **retain** an application means choosing **not to migrate it at all**. This is a valid strategy when the app:

- Still meets business needs as-is
    
- Doesn’t benefit from cloud scalability
    
- Must remain on-premises for **security**, **regulatory**, or **compliance** reasons
    

Think: **“If it ain’t broke (or legally can’t be moved), don’t touch it.”**

#### ✅ Advantages of Retaining

|Advantage|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Stability**|Nothing changes—no downtime, no learning curve, no user confusion.|
|**Regulatory Compliance**|Sensitive systems (like healthcare records or gov data) often **must** stay local.|
|**Cost Control**|If it runs cheap and smooth now, keeping it may cost less than moving it to the cloud.|

#### ⚠️ Challenges of Retaining

|Challenge|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Missed Cloud Benefits**|You won’t get autoscaling, elasticity, pay-as-you-go pricing, or other cloud perks.|
|**Technical Debt Risk**|Over time, non-cloud apps may fall **behind in updates**, making them harder to support and secure.|
### 🧠 When to Choose Retain

- The app is **stable and secure** in its current setup
    
- Compliance laws **prevent migration**
    
- It **doesn’t need** elasticity, scaling, or cloud-native upgrades
    
- You’re **not ready** to invest time or money in changing it

### 🧹 Retire – Shut It Down and Move On

**Definition:**  
To **retire** an application means to **permanently decommission** it—stop using it entirely.  
You typically retire when:

- The app is **obsolete**, **redundant**, or **replaced**
    
- It’s too expensive to maintain
    
- Its functions are absorbed by another system
    

---
#### ✅ Advantages of Retiring

| Advantage               | Explanation                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cost Savings**        | You avoid the costs of keeping, upgrading, or migrating an outdated app.                   |
| **Simplification**      | Eliminates clutter and reduces **infrastructure complexity**. Less to manage = more focus. |
| **Improved Efficiency** | Frees up resources for modern, scalable solutions that **align with new goals**.           |
#### ⚠️ Challenges of Retiring

|Challenge|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Data Migration**|You still have to **preserve critical data**—meaning exports, archives, or integration with newer systems.|
|**Business Disruption**|If the app was still being used, its removal could **interrupt workflows** or require **retraining** and **process changes**.|

### 🧠 When to Retire

- The app is **no longer used** or has low value
    
- It has been **replaced** by a better tool (e.g., SaaS)
    
- Its cost to maintain exceeds its benefit
    
- You’re decluttering your architecture for better **performance and security**
    
☠️ Retire is less about deletion and more about **intentional offboarding**.  
Good migration means knowing **when to walk away**.

### 🧬 Refactor – Clean Code, Lean Future

**Definition:**  
Refactoring is the process of **revising and improving the application's internal codebase** without changing its external behavior.  
It’s often used to:

- Improve **performance**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**
    
- Reduce **technical debt**
    
- Get cloud-ready **without total re-architecture**
    

This is ideal when an app still works, but the codebase is messy, outdated, or hard to scale.

---
#### ✅ Advantages of Refactoring

|Advantage|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Enhanced Performance**|Optimized code = faster execution and better resource use.|
|**Scalability**|Clean code can scale easier when future business demand grows.|
|**Less Technical Debt**|Reduces bugs, streamlines maintenance, and avoids legacy messes.|
#### ⚠️ Challenges of Refactoring

|Challenge|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Ongoing Process**|Refactoring isn’t a one-and-done task. It’s often done in phases over time.|
|**Cost of Change**|While not a total rebuild, it still takes **time, dev resources, and QA effort**—especially for large/complex codebases.|
### 🧠 When to Choose Refactoring

- You want to **modernize** without full re-architecture
    
- The app **works**, but the codebase is **ugly or bloated**
    
- You need **future-proofing** and better **performance**
    
- You’re not ready for re-architecting, but want to **move in that direction**
    

🛠️ Refactor is like remodeling your house room by room—smarter layout, better flow, and a stronger foundation over time.

### 🛒 Bonus Strategy: **Repurchase** (the “SaaS Switch”)

**Definition:**  
Repurchasing means **replacing** your current application with a **commercial cloud-based SaaS product** instead of migrating or rebuilding it.

Think:

- Instead of migrating your internal CRM → just buy **Salesforce**
    
- Instead of hosting your own email → use **Google Workspace** or **Office 365**
    
#### ✅ Advantages

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Speed**|You’re not migrating—just **adopting** a working SaaS product.|
|**Simplicity**|No need to manage updates, hosting, or patching. SaaS providers handle it.|
|**Cost-Effective (Long-Term)**|Lower operational overhead—just pay monthly or per-user pricing.|

#### ⚠️ Challenges

|Challenge|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Vendor Lock-In**|You're now tied to that SaaS provider’s pricing, features, and uptime.|
|**Data Migration**|You still have to **move your data** into the new SaaS platform.|
|**Less Customization**|SaaS may not offer the same level of **custom config or control**.|

---
### 🧠 Repurchasing – Strategic SaaS Adoption

**Reality Check:**  
You might personally prefer **repurchasing** (SaaS) for simplicity and speed,  
but **business needs, data sensitivity, or compliance** can override that.

---

#### 🔐 When Repurchasing _Doesn’t_ Work:

- Company data must **stay on-prem** for legal reasons
    
- You need **full control/customization** of the app
    
- Vendor doesn’t offer a feature you rely on
    
- Migration to SaaS would break existing **integrations or workflows**
    

---

#### ✅ When Repurchasing _Is_ the Move:

- The legacy app is too expensive or painful to maintain
    
- You can replace 80–100% of functionality with a SaaS product
    
- You want **rapid onboarding**, **auto-scaling**, and **reduced maintenance**
