# 📦 Full Notes: Cloud+ Storage Configurations (NAS, DAS, Block, Object, File)

---

## 🔹 1. Types of Cloud Storage

Cloud storage comes in three major types — each with different use cases and behavior in the cloud:

### 📌 Block Storage
- Think of it like a blank hard drive — it's raw, unformatted space.
- You can't use it until it's **formatted with a file system** like NTFS, EXT4, etc.
- After formatting, the OS can store files on it.
- Common in high-performance environments, like SANs (Storage Area Networks).
- Example: AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)

### 📌 Object Storage
- Stores files as "objects" with metadata and a unique ID.
- Great for large-scale, scalable storage like backup, media, or data archives.
- You access objects using HTTP-based APIs, not as traditional files.
- Example: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage

### 📌 File Storage (Filesystem)
- Traditional file/folder structure you’re used to: folders, paths, permissions.
- Uses a network-shared file system (NFS or SMB/CIFS).
- Common in NAS setups.
- Easy to understand and manage, especially for shared team storage.

---

## 🔹 2. Network-Attached Storage (NAS)

📘 **What It Is**:  
NAS is a dedicated storage device connected to a network that lets multiple users or systems access shared files.

### ✅ Key Points:
- Used for **file-level access** (not block-level).
- Devices access files over a **network**, typically LAN.
- Uses **file-sharing protocols**:
  - **NFS** (Linux/Unix)
  - **SMB/CIFS** (Windows)
- Runs on **TCP Port 445** (SMB)

### 🧠 What Happens:
1. Files are stored on a remote NAS device.
2. A server (like a VM or user PC) connects to the NAS.
3. Files are accessed remotely — but it feels local.
4. The OS handles the connection; the NAS does the heavy lifting for file storage.

### 💡 Use Cases:
- File servers
- Home media centers
- Shared company folders
- Centralized document storage

---

## 🔹 3. Direct-Attached Storage (DAS)

📘 **What It Is**:  
DAS means storage is **physically connected** to the computer or server. No network, no fancy protocols.

### ✅ Key Points:
- Simple, fast, local connection.
- No sharing unless the OS sets it up.
- Used for internal drives, USB sticks, external SSDs.

### 💻 Interfaces:
| Interface | Status | Cable Type            | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-------|
| ATA (IDE/PATA) | Old     | Flat ribbon cable        | Legacy desktop use |
| SATA          | Modern | Thin, fast serial cable   | Most common today |
| SCSI          | Legacy Enterprise | Multi-pin bulky | Used in servers; replaced by SAS/NVMe |

### 🔁 In the Cloud:
- Temporary drives in VMs are often DAS-style (ephemeral storage).
- They're fast, but **not persistent** — data is lost if the VM is rebooted or shut down.

---

## 🔹 4. Key Differences: NAS vs DAS

| Feature              | NAS                          | DAS                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Connection           | Over network (Ethernet)       | Direct cable (SATA/SCSI)        |
| Access Type          | File-level                    | Block-level                     |
| Shared?              | Yes (multiple users)          | No (only local)                 |
| Use Case             | File sharing, backups         | Local storage, fast access      |
| Protocols            | SMB, NFS                      | None (direct hardware access)   |
| Example              | Synology NAS, Windows Share   | External SSD, Internal HDD      |

---

## 🔹 5. Fast ID Reference

| Storage Type | Fast?     | Old/New | Shared? | Interface  | Note                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| ATA          | ❌ Slow    | OLD     | ❌       | PATA       | Legacy PC storage                 |
| SATA         | ✅ Fast    | MODERN  | ❌       | Serial     | Common in modern desktops/laptops |
| SCSI         | ⚠️ Medium | OLD     | ❌       | Parallel   | Used in older servers             |
| NAS          | ✅ Shared  | MODERN  | ✅       | Ethernet   | Uses file protocols like SMB      |
| DAS          | ✅ Fast    | MODERN  | ❌       | SATA, SCSI | Local-only, not shared            |

---

Figure 2.13: Storage area network
## 🧠 Storage Area Network (SAN) 
### ⚙️ What’s in the Picture:

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|🖥️ **Server**|The computer/VM host that needs to read/write files|
|🔌 **HBA (Host Bus Adapter)**|A special card in the server to connect to Fibre Channel|
|☁️ **Fibre Channel SAN**|A fast, dedicated storage network (not your usual internet or LAN)|
|📦 **SAN Storage Array**|The actual hard drives or SSDs storing your files, available over the SAN|

---
### 🔹 What Is a SAN?

A **Storage Area Network (SAN)** is a dedicated high-speed network that connects servers to **shared block storage** (like RAID arrays or SSDs).  
It’s **not local storage** and **not file-based** — it’s used for **performance-critical** enterprise environments. (COMPANY; BIG, TOO COMPLEX)

### 📦 Key Components in the Image:

|Component|Role|
|---|---|
|Server|Runs your apps or VMs|
|HBA (Host Bus Adapter)|Specialized network card that talks to SAN over Fibre Channel|
|Fibre Channel SAN|High-speed network fabric (cloud in the image)|
|SAN Storage Array|Big pool of disks, SSDs, or RAID arrays used by many servers|
### 🚀 How It Works:

- The server uses a **block-level protocol** (Fibre Channel or iSCSI) to communicate with the storage
    
- The storage appears like a **local disk** to the server, even though it's remote
    
- **Multiple servers** can share the SAN but see only their own assigned blocks

### 🆚 Fibre Channel vs iSCSI vs NVMe:

|Protocol|Uses|Speed/Performance|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Fibre Channel**|High-end SAN networks|Very fast (up to 128 Gbps)|Not Ethernet-based|
|**iSCSI**|SAN over TCP/IP|Slower, but cheaper & easier|TCP 3260|
|**NVMeOF**|Next-gen SAN tech|Fastest (low latency, SSDs)|Often uses RDMA|

### ☁️ Cloud+ Tip:

- **Fibre Channel = super fast, enterprise use**
    
- **iSCSI = budget SAN option**
    
- **NVMeOF = cutting edge performance (new)**

### ✅ Benefits of SAN:

- **Decouples storage from compute**  
    VMs can move across servers without losing access to their data
    
- **Centralized management** of storage
    
- **Cloud bursting** and **disaster recovery** ready

---
### 🧩 What Is Object Storage?

**Object storage** (sometimes called file storage) is a modern method for storing data in the cloud.  
It does **not** use traditional folders or file systems — instead, it stores each file as an independent “object” inside a **bucket**.

### 🔹 Key Concepts

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**No Filesystem**|Doesn’t use folders, paths, or drive letters|
|**Uses Buckets**|Buckets store objects — like containers|
|**Each Object = File**|Stored with metadata + a unique object ID|
|**Access via API/HTTPS**|No SMB or NFS, only cloud/web protocols|
|**Immutable**|You can't edit a file — you have to re-upload it|
|**Redundancy Built In**|Files stored across multiple physical locations automatically|

### 🪣 Buckets Are Not Folders

- Buckets **can’t be nested** (no folder trees)
    
- You must delete **all files inside** before deleting the bucket
    

### 🛠️ Object Storage vs Filesystem Storage

|Topic|Filesystem (e.g. NTFS)|Object Storage|
|---|---|---|
|Deleting a folder|Deletes everything inside|Doesn’t apply (no folders)|
|Editing a file|Open and change specific parts|Must re-upload entire file|
|Path structure|Uses `/folders/subfolders/`|No folder structure|
|Use case|Local or NAS-style storage|Cloud apps, web backups, media CDN|

### 🏷️ Object ID

- Like a **filename**, but globally unique
    
- Used to locate the object across the storage provider’s cloud
    
- Works even if the physical location of the object changes
    

### 🧾 Metadata

Object storage includes two kinds of metadata:

#### 🔹 Standard Metadata:

- File size
    
- Creation date
    
- Type (e.g. .jpg, .txt)
    
- Application type
    

#### 🔹 Extended Metadata:

- Author name
    
- Encryption details
    
- Tags
    
- Authentication info
    
- **Custom attributes** set by admins or users
    

🧠 **Why It Matters:**  
This metadata makes searching and sorting massive cloud data efficient — especially in **big data** and **AI** applications.

---

### 🔐 Cloud+ Exam Notes

- **Access object storage via API or HTTPS**, not SMB or NFS.
    
- **Object = File + Metadata + Object ID**
    
- Designed for **massive scalability** (billions of files)
    
- **Read/write limitation**: entire file must be re-uploaded if modified
    
- Used by services like **Amazon S3**, **Azure Blob Storage**, **Google Cloud Storage**
    

---


## 🧠 **What Is Software-Defined Storage (SDS)?**

> SDS isn’t new hardware — it’s a **new way to control storage** using software.

You’re still using regular storage systems (like SAN, NAS, local drives), but instead of asking an admin every time you want something, the software handles it for you.

---

### 📦 **What SDS Really Does:**

| Feature                         | What It Means                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💻 **Control via software**     | You manage storage through software (APIs, portals), not physical hardware.                        |
| ⚙️ **Elastic block storage**    | Cloud VMs use SDS to get storage instantly. You ask for a volume — the system handles the backend. |
| 🧍‍♂️ **No need to bug admins** | You don’t wait for a SAN admin to resize LUNs (logical unit numbers) — you do it yourself.         |
| 🔁 **Decentralizes control**    | Shifts control from the storage team to the **user or VM admin**.                                  |
### 🛠️ **What’s a vSAN (Virtual SAN)?**

> SDS example: **vSAN** = virtual SAN across multiple hosts.

- Combines **local storage** on multiple servers
    
- Acts like a SAN, but it’s **software controlled**
    
- Adds features like:
    
    - ✅ Encryption
        
    - ✅ Compression
        
    - ✅ Deduplication
        
    - ✅ Replication
        

---

### 💡 Why It Matters for Cloud+:

- **Speeds up deployment** (you don’t need to wait for IT to allocate storage)
    
- **Scales easily** (need more? Add it yourself)
    
- **Reduces admin overhead** (no more resizing LUNs manually)
    

---

### 🔑 Key Terms:

| Term                      | What It Means                                              |     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **SDS**                   | Software-defined storage — abstracted, software-controlled |     |
| **LUN**                   | Logical Unit Number — block storage chunk on a SAN         |     |
| **vSAN**                  | Virtual SAN made of local+shared storage                   |     |
| **Elastic Block Storage** | Dynamically provisioned storage volumes                    |     |
|                           |                                                            |     |

---

## 🛡️ Encrypted EBS Volume (AWS)

### 🔐 What It Is:

- EBS = **Elastic Block Store**, used by EC2 instances for block-level storage.
    
- This is **data-at-rest encryption** using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**.
    

### 🔒 What Gets Encrypted:

- The **volume itself**
    
- **Snapshots**
    
- All **data in transit** between EBS and the EC2 instance
    

### ⚙️ How It Works:

- Managed **seamlessly** by AWS (no need for manual config)
    
- **No performance impact**
    
- Integrated with **IAM policies** for fine-grained access control
    

### ✅ Why It Matters:

- Meets **compliance and security requirements**
    
- Ensures **unauthorized users can’t access data**
    
- Helps with **data protection in cloud environments**
---
## 📦 Storage Provisioning

### 🧠 What It Means:

- **Provisioning** = the act of creating and assigning storage to be used in the cloud (usually as volumes).
    
- Volumes are mounted from a **server** or accessed by **remote users**.
    

### 🏢 Traditional (Enterprise Data Center):

- Storage provisioning = complex process requiring:
    
    - Storage engineers
        
    - Installation/config of **SANs**, **LUNs**, and **vSANs**
        
    - Mounting storage using **HBAs (Host Bus Adapters)**
        
- Security, redundancy, backup—all must be configured manually.
    

### ☁️ Cloud-Based Provisioning:

- Cloud platforms **automate** this process.
    
- Can provision storage in **minutes** using a **web console**.
    
- Select options like:
    
    - 🔁 Replication
        
    - 🔐 Encryption
        
    - 📏 Volume size
        
    - 🧱 Storage type
        
    - 🛡️ Security levels / tiers
        

🛠️ Just click **Create** and it’s ready to deploy.

## 🪵 Thick vs 🧊 Thin Provisioning

### 🪵 Thick Provisioning

- **Allocates full requested storage immediately.**
    
- Example: You request **100 GB**, and the system **reserves all 100 GB** upfront.
    
- No matter how much you use, the full space is locked for that volume.
    

✅ Pros:

- Guaranteed space
    
- Predictable performance
    

❌ Cons:

- Can waste storage if not fully used
    

---

### 🧊 Thin Provisioning

- **Allocates storage only as needed.**
    
- Example: You request 100 GB, but only **5 GB is used initially**, so only that is allocated at first.
    
- More space is added later **automatically** as usage grows.
    

✅ Pros:

- Saves space
    
- Efficient for unpredictable growth
    

❌ Cons:

- Can run into space issues if the system isn't monitored properly

---
## 💥 Storage Overcommitment

### 🔍 What It Is:

- You allocate **more storage space than physically exists**.
    
- Done using **thin provisioning**, which allows virtual machines (VMs) to expand their disk space **on demand**.
    

### 🛠 How It Works:

- Example: You have 1 TB of real storage.
    
- You assign **1.5 TB total** across all VMs.
    
- Each VM **thinks** it has full access, but space is only used **as they actually write data**.
    

### ✅ Why Use It:

- Efficient use of available storage.
    
- Saves money on unused space.
    
- Good for environments with **bursty or unpredictable workloads**.
    

### ⚠️ Dangers:

- If all VMs try to use their full allocation, **you can run out of real disk**.
    
- This leads to **write failures**, **VM crashes**, or even **data loss**.
    

### 🧠 Pro Tip:

- **Monitor closely!** Overcommitment is powerful but risky.
    
- Not recommended for **critical systems** that can't afford downtime.

---

## 🔄 Physical to Physical (P2P) Migration

### 🖥 What It Is:

Some legacy apps run directly on physical servers and **can’t be virtualized**. These apps must be migrated to **another physical machine**, either in a cloud data center or on-prem.

### ⚙️ How It Works:

- Cloud providers may offer **bare-metal servers** for this use case.
    
- P2P migrations typically move **both the OS and application** to a new physical host.
    

### 🧰 Tools Used:

- **Conversion utilities** handle:
    
    - Driver compatibility
        
    - Hardware differences
        
- These may be included with cloud services or provided by third-party software.
    

### 🚚 Migration Options:

1. **Reinstall + Manual Setup**: Install OS and app from scratch.
    
2. **Migration Utility**: Automate transfer of OS and data.
    
3. **Drive Shipping**: Physically ship hard drives to the cloud provider.
    

### 💰 Considerations:

- More expensive due to **dedicated hardware**.
    
- Slower than virtual migrations.
    
- Necessary for **non-virtualizable apps** or **hardware-bound workloads**.

## 🔐 Encrypting Data at Rest

### 📦 What is _Data at Rest_?

Data stored on a **disk or storage medium**, not currently being transmitted. Unlike _data in transit_ (moving across networks), data at rest is idle but still vulnerable.

### 🔑 Why Encrypt It?

Encryption ensures **no unencrypted data** is written to disk. Protects sensitive info even if the storage is breached. Required by many regulations.

### 🧰 Key Management Options:

- Encryption keys are used to encrypt/decrypt files.
    
- Keys may be managed by:
    
    - The **cloud provider** (simpler, but provider can access it)
        
    - The **customer** (more secure, but higher responsibility)
        

---

### 🔒 Server-Side Encryption

> Cloud provider handles everything.

- Provider manages keys and encrypts/decrypts data on the fly.
    
- Transparent to the user.
    
- Downside: **Provider has access to keys** and can be compelled to hand over data.
    

---

### 🧠 Client-Side Encryption

> Customer encrypts data before sending it.

- User manages the keys.
    
- Stronger security: **even the provider can’t read it**.
    
- If the key is lost, data becomes **inaccessible forever**.
    
- Ideal for high-security environments.

---
## 🏷️ Token-Based Access to Storage

### 🔐 What is a Token?

A **token** is a **temporary credential** that grants secure, time-limited access to cloud resources such as:

- 🔸 Object storage (files, backups)
    
- 🔸 Virtual machines (VMs)
    
- 🔸 PaaS or SaaS applications
    

---

### 🧪 How Tokens Are Used

Tokens are often used instead of traditional usernames/passwords, especially for:

- Command-line/API access
    
- Short-term download links
    
- Automating temporary access
    

---

### 🛍️ Real-World Example:

Imagine an **e-commerce website** that sells software. You store the files in **cloud object storage**, but you don’t want random people downloading them.

Here’s how a token helps:

1. A customer buys software.
    
2. The website generates a **special download URL** that includes a **token**.
    
3. That token provides **read-only access** for a **limited time**.
    
4. Even if someone else sees the URL, it **expires soon** (or after one use).
    
5. Pirates can’t steal your stuff. 👏
    

---

### ✅ Key Benefits:

- 🔒 Time-limited access
    
- 🔁 Single-use option for added control
    
- 🛡️ Reduces exposure of cloud storage to unauthorized access
    
- 🚫 No need for individual accounts per user

---
## ⚙️ Input/Output Operations per Second (IOPS)

- **IOPS** = how many input/output (I/O) operations per second your storage can handle.
    
- Higher IOPS = faster performance for reading/writing data.
    
- Cloud providers often let you choose guaranteed IOPS levels for block storage.
    

🧠 **Example**:

- 20 GB volume → ~60 IOPS
    
- 100 GB volume → ~300 IOPS  
    → More storage = more disks = more parallel read/write power.

## 📦 Compression and Deduplication

These are two methods to **save disk space**, but they work differently:

### 🔽 Compression:

- Stores **repeated content only once** in a file.
    
- Uses **pointers** to refer to reused data.
    
- Analogy: Replace every “the” with “#” to save space.
    

---

### 🧹 Deduplication:

- Goes beyond a single file—looks for redundant data **across the entire system**.
    
- Example: A SAN detects that **100 VMs all use the same OS image** → stores it once.
    
- Results: Gigabytes or even **terabytes** of storage savings.
    

---

## ⚖️ Trade-Off: Speed vs Storage

Using compression/deduplication:

- Saves space ✅
    
- Slows down performance ❌ (uses CPU to compress/decompress)
    

Use wisely:

- ✅ Good for: Archive, backup, infrequently accessed data
    
- ❌ Avoid for: High-speed databases, real-time workloads, latency-sensitive apps
---
## 📚 Storage Tiering: Organizing Data by Priority

Storage tiering means assigning data to different classes (tiers) based on how often it's accessed, how critical it is, and the performance or redundancy it needs. This helps balance cost, performance, and data protection.

---

### 🔺 **Tier 1** – _Critical / Frequently Accessed_

- ⚡ Highest speed, redundancy, and quality
    
- 💾 Stored on enterprise-grade, high-performance media
    
- 🔁 Can tolerate disk failure with **no data loss or downtime**
    
- 🛠️ Best for: Mission-critical systems, transactional databases, hot data
    

---

### 🔹 **Tier 2** – _Moderate / Occasionally Accessed_

- 🐢 Lower performance than Tier 1
    
- 🌐 Can be accessed remotely or over a network
    
- 💰 Less expensive, uses mid-range hardware
    
- 📧 Best for: Email storage, shared drives, web servers
    

---

### 🧊 **Tier 3** – _Cold / Archival Storage_

- 💤 Rarely accessed data, backups, archives
    
- 🐌 Slowest performance, cheapest storage
    
- 🗃️ Best for: Regulatory data, old records, archived emails
    

---

## 🧠 Key Points

- Lower tiers = **lower performance** but **cheaper cost**
    
- Data can move between tiers automatically over time (via scripting/automation)
    
- Only store data in Tier 1 **if it actually needs it** — don’t overpay
    

---

### 🏷️ Example Use Case:

- **Current emails** = Tier 1
    
- **1-year-old emails** = Tier 2
    
- **7-year-old archived emails (for audits)** = Tier 3

--- 

## 🛡️ Managing and Protecting Stored Data

### 📦 **Durability**

- **Durability** = how well a storage system preserves your data over time
    
- A durability rating of 100% would mean _zero data loss_ in a year (not realistic—nobody guarantees that!)
    
- Cloud providers **aim for high durability**, but they know some data loss is still statistically possible
    

---

### 🔐 **Who’s Responsible?**

- **Cloud provider**:
    
    - Maintains availability and infrastructure reliability
        
    - May offer replication and redundancy features
        
- **You (the customer)**:
    
    - Still responsible for data **integrity and availability**
        
    - Even with provider guarantees, **you must take action to protect your data**
        

> 💡 TL;DR: Just because the cloud provider promises high uptime and durability doesn’t mean you should skip backups, encryption, or access control.

---
## 🔄 High Availability and Failover

### 💡 **High Availability (HA)**

- The ability of a system to **recover quickly and automatically** after a component failure.
    
- Requires **redundant components** (e.g., multiple servers, power supplies, network paths).
    
- If one component fails, its backup **takes over automatically**.
    
- There may be a short **delay during failover**.
    
- ⚠️ **Important:** _High availability does not mean zero downtime!_ Outages may still happen, even in cloud environments.
    

---

### 🛠️ **Fault Tolerance**

- The ability of a system to **remain operational** even _after_ a component fails.
    
- Achieved through **resilient design** (e.g., redundant power supplies).
    
- Example: If a server has dual power supplies and one fails, the other keeps it running.
    
- Focuses on **eliminating downtime entirely** by designing around possible points of failure.
    

---

### ✅ Summary

|Concept|Key Feature|Downtime Risk|
|---|---|---|
|High Availability|Fast failover using redundancy|🔸 Low|
|Fault Tolerance|Continuous operation without interruption|🟢 Very Low|
## 🌍 Cross-Region Replication

### 📦 **Data Replication**

- The process of placing **copies of stored data** on multiple systems for:
    
    - ✅ Disaster recovery
        
    - ✅ Increased resiliency and availability
        

### 🚨 Why It Matters

- If all data is stored in **one availability zone**, and that zone fails:
    
    - Data becomes **inaccessible** until services are restored
        
    - In catastrophic events (e.g., earthquakes, fire), data could be **lost permanently**
        

### 🧠 Cloud Provider Strategy

- Providers often replicate storage **across multiple zones**
    
    - Example: Block storage may be auto-copied across availability zones
        
    - If the zone fails:
        
        - 🛑 VMs might go down
            
        - ✅ Block storage data survives
            

---

### ⚠️ Replication ≠ Immunity

- **Data corruption** can still happen—and get **replicated**
    
- ➕ Best practice: Always keep **backups** of critical data
    
- Especially valuable data should be replicated:
    
    - Across **different regions**
        
    - To satisfy **retention** and **availability** needs
---
## 🔁 Replication Types: Synchronous vs Asynchronous

### ⚙️ Synchronous Replication

- **Goal**: Zero data loss
    
- **How it works**:
    
    - Writes data to both **primary and secondary** systems **simultaneously**
        
    - Only confirms success once **both locations complete** the write
        
- **Best For**:
    
    - High-end **transactional databases**
        
    - Systems requiring **real-time consistency**
        
    - Environments needing **instant failover**
        
- **Benefit**:
    
    - Fastest recovery time (low RTO = Recovery Time Objective)
        
- **Downside**:
    
    - Costly due to **cross-region latency and bandwidth**
        
    - May not scale well for **busy, high-transaction workloads**
        

---

### 💸 Asynchronous Replication

- **Goal**: Save cost while maintaining redundancy
    
- **How it works**:
    
    - Data is written **first to primary**, then **forwarded to secondary**
        
    - Uses a **store-and-forward** approach (delayed)
        
- **Best For**:
    
    - Systems with **infrequent writes**
        
    - Use cases where **eventual consistency** is acceptable
        
- **Benefit**:
    
    - **Lower cost** option for backup/archival
        
- **Downside**:
    
    - **Potential data loss** if failure occurs before sync completes

---

## 📦 Cloning Your Stored Data

- **Purpose**: To create backups or replicas of block storage volumes across regions.
    
- **How it works**:
    
    - Cloud providers allow replication of **block storage** by using **snapshots**.
        
    - Snapshots can be taken **automatically** every few hours.
        
    - These snapshots can be **replicated to another region** for disaster recovery or redundancy.
        
- **Methods**:
    
    - Use a **custom script** (e.g., scheduled snapshot + sync to region)
        
    - Use **built-in functionality** from providers (like AWS EBS Snapshots)
        
- **Recovery**:
    
    - Snapshots can be used to **provision a new volume**.
        
    - The volume can then be **attached to a VM** to restore services.
        

---
## 🔁 Using RAID for Redundancy

**RAID** = Redundant Array of Independent Disks  
RAID combines multiple physical drives to improve:

- **Redundancy** (survivability)
    
- **Performance** (speed, IOPS)
    
- **Capacity** (usable storage)
    

There are different RAID configurations, referred to as **RAID levels**. Some focus on speed, others on redundancy, or a mix of both.

---

### 🔹 RAID 0 — Striping (No Redundancy)

- **Splits data** across two or more disks (striping)
    
- **Boosts performance** by parallel reads/writes
    
- **No redundancy** — one disk fails, all data is lost
    
- Good for: Speed-hungry tasks (temporary cache, dispensable data)
[Disk 0] Block 0, Block 2, Block 4  
[Disk 1] Block 1, Block 3, Block 5

### 🔹 RAID 1 — Mirroring

- **Duplicates data** on two drives
    
- Strong **redundancy**, but **storage cost = 2x**
    
- **Read performance** improves (can read from both), write is slower
    
- Good for: High-value data, system boot drives
[Disk 0] Block 0, Block 1, Block 2  
[Disk 1] Block 0, Block 1, Block 2

### 🔹 RAID 10 (1+0) — Mirrored Stripes

- Combines **RAID 1** and **RAID 0**
    
- Stripes across mirrored pairs
    
- High **performance + redundancy**
    
- Requires minimum **4 disks**

RAID 0 across RAID 1 mirrors:
[RAID 1] <--> [RAID 1]
     \            /
     [RAID 0 stripe]


### 🔹 RAID 0+1 — Striped Mirrors

- Mirrors across striped arrays (opposite of RAID 10)
    
- Less fault-tolerant than RAID 10
    
- If one stripe fails, entire array fails
    

---

### 🔹 RAID 5 — Striping with Single Parity

- Data + parity distributed across 3+ disks
    
- **Efficient**: Only ~1 disk's worth used for parity
    
- **Can lose 1 disk** and recover using parity
    
- Read = fast, Write = slower (due to parity calculation)

Parity is calculated using XOR logic (e.g., 1 ⊕ 0 = 1)
[Disk 0] Block 0a, Block 1a, Block 2p  
[Disk 1] Block 0b, Block 1p, Block 2a  
[Disk 2] Block 0p, Block 1b, Block 2b

### 🔹 RAID 6 — Striping with Dual Parity

- Similar to RAID 5, but can tolerate **2 disk failures**
    
- Needs **minimum 4 disks**
    
- Dual parity = more overhead
    
- Writes are slower than RAID 5

[Disk 0] Block 0a, Block 1a, Block 2p1  
[Disk 1] Block 0b, Block 1p1, Block 2a  
[Disk 2] Block 0p1, Block 1b, Block 2b  
[Disk 3] Block 0p2, Block 1p2, Block 2p2

### 🧠 Key Concepts

|RAID|Minimum Disks|Redundancy|Speed|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|2|❌ None|✅ Fast|High performance, risky|
|1|2|✅ Yes|🟡 Read only|Simple, but costly|
|5|3|✅ 1 disk|🟡 Read fast|Balanced, write slow|
|6|4|✅ 2 disks|🟡 Slower writes|Great fault tolerance|
|10|4|✅ Yes|✅ Fast|Expensive but powerful|
|0+1|4|✅ Weaker|✅ Fast|Not as fault-tolerant as RAID 10|

## 📦 Quotas and Expiration (Cloud+)

One major benefit of cloud storage: **seemingly unlimited space**  
Downside: potentially **unlimited cost** — so tools like quotas and expiration help control it.

---

### 🔒 Quotas (Limit Usage)

- Quotas limit how much data a user can store on a system.
    
- Common with **file system storage** (like NFS or SMB) to stop users from hoarding space.
    
- Example: Shared drives mapped to user desktops.
    
- Good for:
    
    - Preventing abuse (e.g., downloading full music libraries)
        
    - Keeping costs and space usage in check
        
- **Some providers allow quotas for object storage**, too.
    

---

### ⏳ Object Expiration (Auto-Delete)

- Applies mainly to **object storage**
    
- Automatically **deletes files** past a defined age
    
- Can also **move data to cheaper storage tiers** before deletion
    
- Great for:
    
    - Logs
        
    - Temporary files
        
    - Old backup versions
        

---

### 🧱 Block Storage: What About It?

- Block storage is **allocated up front** (e.g., during VM setup)
    
- Does **not grow automatically**
    
- You won’t need quotas or expiration
    
- You can **manually resize** block volumes if needed
    

---

## 🔐 Storage Security Considerations (Cloud+)

Storage isn't just where data _sits_ — it's where data _lives_. So, protecting that data is a critical part of cloud security.

---

### 🧱 Why Storage Security Matters

- Data spends most of its life **at rest** in storage.
    
- Security here is essential for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    

---

### ⚖️ Legal & Regulatory Pressure

- Many **laws and regulations** govern how data is stored, especially when it comes to:
    
    - **Privacy**
        
    - **Jurisdiction** (e.g., data must stay in its country of origin)
        
    - **Encryption** (required **in transit** and **at rest**)
        

---

### 🛡️ What to Expect from Cloud Providers

Cloud providers typically offer:

- Built-in encryption (default or optional)
    
- Storage region selection (for compliance with data sovereignty)
    
- Role-based access controls (RBAC)
    
- Object-level permissions
    
- Logging and monitoring

---
## 🔐 Access Control for Your Cloud-Based Storage

### 📋 What is an ACL?

- An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a security mechanism used to permit or deny access to cloud storage objects.
    
- Similar to network ACLs for routers and firewalls, but applies to cloud storage resources.
    

---

### 🎯 Purpose

- ACLs **control who can read, write, modify, or delete** data in storage buckets.
    
- Users or groups (e.g., everyone, authenticated users, admins) can be given specific access.
    
- Each file or object can have a unique ACL.
    

---

### 🧪 Example

- A customer is given a **read-only token** to download software.
    
- This token is backed by an ACL that only allows **read** access — no delete, no modify.
    
- If a developer also needs **modify** access, a second ACE (Access Control Entry) must be added to allow both **read and write**.
    

---

### 🧱 Key Term

- **ACE (Access Control Entry)**: An entry in an ACL that defines what a user or group can do with an object.

---
## 🕵️ Understanding Obfuscation

### 🧠 What is Obfuscation?

- **Obfuscation** is a technique used to make information **difficult to read, interpret, or understand**.
    
- It’s used to protect sensitive details from unauthorized access or misuse.
    

---

### 🧪 Example Use

- Replacing obvious usernames like `admin` with random strings like `user_98k2slx` helps obscure identity or access roles.
    
- This slows down attackers trying to exploit default or predictable names.
    

---

### 🔐 Benefits

- Makes it harder for attackers to understand stolen or exposed data.
    
- Adds a **layer of defense** against brute-force or automated scanning attacks.
    

---

### ⚠️ Risk: Dual Use

- While obfuscation helps defend, **attackers also use it**:
    
    - Malware in webpages often uses obfuscated JavaScript to appear harmless.
        
    - Reverse engineering becomes harder if code is obfuscated.
        

---

## 🧩 Storage Area Networking, Zoning, and LUN Masking

### 🧠 What is Zoning?

- **Zoning** is a SAN (Storage Area Network) security feature that controls which devices (initiators) can access specific storage targets (like LUNs).
    
- Think of zoning as a **firewall for your SAN fabric**—it isolates devices for security and traffic management.
    

#### 🔒 Types of Zoning:

- **Hard Zoning**: Based on port numbers.
    
- **Soft Zoning**: Based on device worldwide names (WWNs).
    

#### 🏗 How it Works:

- Zoning is configured on **SAN switches** (e.g., Fibre Channel).
    
- Devices in different zones **cannot communicate**.
    
- Each **VM or host** is only allowed to mount its assigned storage volumes.
    

#### 🛠️ Real-World Uses:

- Prevents Linux from accessing Windows LUNs and vice versa.
    
- Ensures VMs mount only the storage they’re assigned.
    
- Example: Restrict boot from SAN volumes to only the intended VM.
    

---

### 🧱 LUN Masking

#### 🔐 What is LUN Masking?

- Similar to zoning, but done at the **storage controller level**, not the switch.
    
- Controls **which servers or VMs can access which LUNs**.
    

#### 🎛️ Function:

- Prevents one server from accessing another server’s storage unintentionally.
    
- Especially important when:
    
    - Booting from SAN.
        
    - Sharing a storage array across a cluster.
        
    - Using bare-metal servers that need isolated boot LUNs.
        

---

### 📊 Zoning vs LUN Masking Summary

|Feature|Zoning|LUN Masking|
|---|---|---|
|Configured on|SAN Fabric Switch|Storage Controller|
|Controls|Who can talk to whom|What LUNs can be seen/used|
|Main Use|Traffic segmentation & access|LUN-level access restriction|
|Granularity|By port or WWN|By LUN and host|

---

### 🔧 **Hyperconverged Appliances – What It Means**

**Hyperconvergence** = Combining compute power **(like CPUs and RAM)** + **storage** into one system. No more separate boxes.

- In old-school setups:  
    You had **virtualization servers** (like VMWare or Hyper-V) that connected to **centralized storage** (SANs) somewhere else.
    
- In hyperconverged setups:  
    Everything is **inside the same box** (storage + compute). Each server has **lots of storage** (terabytes) **built in**.
    

> These servers are called **hyperconverged appliances**.

🧠 **Why it matters:**

- You manage **one unit**, not two separate systems.
    
- It’s simpler, faster to scale, and more cloud-like.

---
### 🔐 **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** — What It Actually Means

**DLP** = Tools that stop sensitive data from leaking out, either **by accident or on purpose**.

---

### 🧠 How DLP works:

- Instead of just “Allow” or “Deny” (like firewalls), DLP looks at:
    
    - **What kind** of data it is (e.g., Social Security Numbers)
        
    - **How much** is being transferred
        
    - **Where** it’s going (USB, cloud, email, etc.)
        
    - **When** it’s happening (odd time of day?)
        
    - **Who** is doing it (is it normal for them?)
        

---

### 🤖 DLP + Machine Learning:

- Flags weird behavior like someone copying **gigabytes of files** they normally don’t touch
    
- Detects private info (SSNs, credit card numbers) and auto-classifies it as **sensitive**
    
- Blocks or logs suspicious data transfers (like outbound network traffic)
    

---

### 🔐 DLP for Encryption:

- Can **auto-encrypt** stuff like USB drives as soon as they’re plugged in
    
- If someone loses the drive, data is still protected
    
- Policies decide who can do what with the data

---
### 🔐 **Endpoint Protection**

**Goal:** Stop threats from getting into your devices (laptops, desktops, servers, phones).

---

### 🚨 What it Does:

- Uses software to **monitor**, **analyze**, and **act fast** on threats.
    
- Protects against:
    
    - **Viruses**
        
    - **Malware**
        
    - **Ransomware**
        
    - **Zero-day exploits** (unknown, unpatched attacks)
        
    - **Suspicious behavior** (weird stuff your system shouldn’t be doing)
        

---

### 🧠 Key Tools:

- **EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform):** Combo of antivirus, anti-malware, behavior checks.
    
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Watches your systems like a hawk 24/7. Uses AI/ML to catch sneaky threats **before** damage is done.
    
- **XDR (Extended Detection and Response):** Same as EDR but it watches **networks and cloud**, not just devices.
    

---

### 🛡️ How Organizations Protect Endpoints:

- Least privilege access (users only get the access they truly need)
    
- Application whitelisting (only trusted apps run)
    
- Threat intel feeds (uses real-world data to stay ahead of new threats)
    
- **ZTA (Zero Trust Architecture)**: Trust no one—not even your own devices or users.
    

---

### 🏢 Why It Matters:

- Especially critical now that people work remotely
    
- Protects company resources no matter where employees are logging in from

---

### ☁️ **How You Access Cloud Storage:**

When you run **virtual machines (VMs)** in the cloud, they need space to save stuff—just like your computer’s hard drive. That’s where **cloud storage volumes** come in. These are cloud-based drives that your VMs treat like local disks.

---

### 🔑 **How You Get to Your Stuff:**

- **Cloud software clients** (apps) help you sync your files between devices and the cloud.
    
    - Examples: **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, **OneDrive**
        
- **Web browsers** can also be used to access storage (like with **Amazon S3**).
    
- **Developers/Admins** might use:
    
    - **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) — coded access
        
    - **CLI** (Command Line Interface) — text-based commands
        

---

### 🚀 The Point:

Whether you’re using a VM, desktop app, browser, or terminal command—cloud storage is flexible and you can get to it from pretty much anywhere, depending on what tools you prefer.

---

### 🧱 What’s an Image Registry?

An **image registry** is a place (like a server or cloud platform) where **container images** are stored, versioned, secured, and shared. Think of it like a warehouse for Docker containers that lets devs:

- Store and share their app builds
    
- Avoid version conflicts
    
- Keep everything consistent across environments (dev, test, prod)
    

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Two Types of Registries:

1. **Public Registries**
    
    - Open to anyone (examples: **Docker Hub**, **Red Hat Quay**)
        
    - Offer tons of ready-to-use images
        
    - Great for speeding up app development
        
2. **Private Registries**
    
    - Locked down for internal use
        
    - Good for companies that need extra **security**, **compliance**, and **control**
        
    - Use authentication to stop unauthorized access
        

---

### 🔐 Security & Automation Features:

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Detect known issues in images
    
- **Digital Signing**: Verify that images haven’t been tampered with
    
- **Role-Based Access**: Only the right people can access/use certain images
    
- **CI/CD Integration**: Registries can plug into your build pipeline so new images are pushed and pulled automatically (e.g., using **Harbor** or **Azure Container Registry**)
    

---
