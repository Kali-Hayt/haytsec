#### 🌩️ Why Server Migration Matters

Migrating to the cloud means moving your old servers and apps into a virtual, cloud-based environment. You need to understand **how to lift and shift** those systems without breaking them or losing performance.

---

#### 🔧 Step-by-Step Breakdown

##### 1. **Baseline Requirements**

Before doing anything:

- Record specs: CPU, memory, storage, network.
    
- Know when peak usage happens (time of day, workload spikes).
    
- Understand what applications the server runs.
    

> 🎯 **Goal**: Use this info to design your VM (Virtual Machine) in the cloud so it performs just like — or better than — the original.

---

##### 2. **Prepare for Downtime**

- Some downtime is likely.
    
- Use scheduled maintenance windows (nights, weekends).
    
- Write an **implementation plan**:
    
    - What will be changed
        
    - How to roll it back if things go south
        
    - Steps to **validate** (i.e., test if it works afterward)
        

---

##### 3. **Watch for Bottlenecks**

During migration:

- Look for performance problems: CPU limits, memory pressure, disk I/O, or network slowness.
    
- Fix issues on the fly by adjusting your VM setup.
    

---

##### 4. **Post-Migration Testing**

- Follow a **testing plan** after the move.
    
- Validate that the cloud VM runs correctly.
    
- Take **another baseline** to compare with the old server’s performance.
    

> 🧠 Think of it like doing “before and after” photos for your infrastructure.

---

#### ✅ Summary

Server migration isn't just copying files. You:

- Analyze the current system
    
- Plan for migration and downtime
    
- Monitor and adjust during the move
    
- Test everything after
    
- Confirm the new system works just as well (or better)

---
#### 🧭 Different Types of Server Migrations

When migrating to the cloud, there are two main strategies:

---

#### 🔹 1. Start Fresh (Clean Install)

- Create **new VMs (Virtual Machines)** in the cloud.
    
- Install a **clean OS**, then manually install applications.
    
- Migrate your data as needed.
    
- ✅ **Pros:** Fewer technical issues.
    
- ❌ **Cons:** Time-consuming, requires manual effort.
    

---

#### 🔹 2. Migrate Existing Machines

- Move **your current system as-is** into a cloud-compatible format.
    
- Requires conversion and often special migration tools from your cloud provider.
    
- ✅ **Pros:** Keeps existing setup, apps, and configs.
    
- ❌ **Cons:** Compatibility issues may arise.
    

---

#### 📝 Note

> Most cloud providers support **bare-metal installation** for cases where your app doesn’t support virtualization.
> 
> Example: You might bypass VMs and install the OS directly onto cloud hardware for performance or compatibility reasons.

#### 🖥️ Physical to Virtual (P2V) Migration

A **P2V migration** means converting a traditional, physical server (running an OS and apps) into a **virtual machine (VM)**.

---

#### 🔧 What Happens in a P2V Migration?

- The **physical server’s data** is copied to a **virtual disk**.
    
- Two methods of copying:
    
    1. **Block-level copy**  
        ➤ Copies each disk block exactly (bit-for-bit).  
        ➤ Result: Full disk clone (same as the physical one).
        
    2. **File-level copy**  
        ➤ Copies only files, not the entire disk.  
        ➤ Useful for smaller disks or when changing file system format.
        

---

#### 🛠️ Tools Used for P2V

- **VMware vCenter Converter**
    
- **Microsoft Virtual Machine Manager**
    
- **Other third-party or cloud-based automated tools**
    

---

#### 📌 Use Case Tip:

- Use **block-level copy** for complete migrations or backups.
    
- Use **file-level copy** when switching file systems or shrinking disk size.

#### 💻 Virtual to Virtual (V2V) Migration

A **V2V migration** means taking an **existing virtual machine (VM)** and converting its virtual disk to a **format supported by a cloud provider**, so it can be launched in the cloud.

---

#### 🔁 How V2V Migration Works

- No need to convert from physical—just modify the VM disk image.
    
- You **convert the existing VM** to a **cloud-compatible format**, then deploy it on the cloud platform.
    

---

#### 📦 Common Virtual Disk Formats

Each cloud platform and hypervisor supports different disk formats. Here are a few:

|Format|Vendor|Full Name|
|---|---|---|
|**VDI**|Oracle VirtualBox|Virtual Disk Image|
|**VMDK**|VMware|Virtual Machine Disk|
|**VHD**|Microsoft|Virtual Hard Disk|
|**AMI**|Amazon AWS|Amazon Machine Image|
#### 🧠 Key Reminder:

Always verify that the **VM disk format is supported by the target cloud provider**—conversion may be needed!


#### 🖥️ Virtual to Physical (V2P) Migration

A **V2P migration** means taking a virtual server (VM) and converting it back to a **physical server**.

---

#### 🛠️ Use Cases

- Rarely used, but helpful when:
    
    - A vendor **doesn't support running the app inside a VM**
        
    - Legacy software or hardware-specific configurations are required
        

---

#### ⚙️ Considerations

- V2P is **not straightforward** – may require:
    
    - **Fresh install** of OS and apps
        
    - Matching hardware to the original VM setup
        
    - Research and planning for unique configurations
        
- Many **technical details** depend on the virtualization software and hardware compatibility
    

---

#### ⚠️ Heads-Up:

- This is the **least common** type of migration
    
- Often more trouble than it's worth unless there’s a hard technical blocker to virtualization
    

---
#### 🔁 Online vs Offline Migration

---

#### 🟢 Online Migration

- **Faster** and often preferred
    
- Performed over a network between:
    
    - Source data center (current VM/server)
        
    - Target cloud data center (new VM)
        
- **Limitation:** Requires **high bandwidth**
    
- If bandwidth is poor → expect delays or failure
    

---

#### 🔴 Offline Migration

- Used when online migration isn’t possible
    
- Data is **written to physical media** and **shipped** to the cloud provider
    
- Cloud provider then:
    
    - **Imports the disk image**
        
    - Makes it available for provisioning new VMs
        
- **Slower** due to:
    
    - Physical shipping delays
        
    - Import/activation time
        

---

#### ⚖️ Quick Tip:

> **If bandwidth is good ➝ go online**  
> **If bandwidth sucks ➝ go offline**

---

#### ☁️ Migrating Your Storage Data

---

#### 🔄 Why It's Important:

Even if you're using **P2V**, **V2V**, or **V2P**, you still need to **migrate storage data** separately — especially if it's stored on:

- **SAN (Storage Area Network)**
    
- **NAS (Network-Attached Storage)**
    

Most cloud migrations involve copying **files** from local storage to **cloud storage** over the network.

---

#### 🛠️ Factors to Consider:

- **Bandwidth limitations** can seriously delay transfers.
    
- Transferring **petabyte-scale** data over the Internet can take **weeks** or **months**.
    

---

#### 💡 Workarounds and Solutions:

1. **Use physical appliances**:
    
    - Ship a device to your data center
        
    - Copy the data **locally** into it
        
    - Ship it to the cloud provider to upload directly
        
2. **Local staging with background uploads**:
    
    - Use cloud-provided hardware as a **local data store**
        
    - It uploads in the background later
        
3. **Shipping containers of drives**:
    
    - Some providers offer literal **container-sized storage systems** to move bulk data efficiently
        

---

#### 🧠 Pro Tip:

> If you’ve got **tons of data** and a **weak internet pipe**, don’t even try to upload it all — ship it.

---
#### 🔀 Addressing Application Portability

---

#### ⚠️ Why It Matters

Vendor lock-in happens when your applications depend too heavily on a specific cloud provider's **proprietary services**. If there's:

- A **SLA breach**
    
- A **major outage**
    
- A **pricing hike** or **geopolitical restriction**  
    → You need to be able to **move your application elsewhere**.
    

---

#### 🧱 Traditional Applications (Good Portability)

- Run on standard **Linux** or **Windows** servers
    
- Fit well into **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
    
- Depend on basic analogs: **compute, storage, networking**
    
- Easy to migrate between providers
    
- May require **V2V conversion** or **VM rebuild**
    

---

#### ☁️ Cloud-Native Applications (Low Portability)

- Rely on **proprietary, platform-specific services**
    
- Use terms like **“managed”** or **“elastic”**
    
- Examples: object storage, managed databases (SQL/NoSQL)
    

These are harder to move because:

- May require **code rewrites**
    
- Must replace **connection strings**
    
- Often require provider-specific **SDKs** or **APIs**
    

---

#### 🧠 Example:

If an app uses AWS's **managed database** or **S3**, you can’t just “lift-and-shift” it to Azure or GCP. You’ll need to:

- Change database configs
    
- Rework code to fit Azure Blob or Google Cloud Storage

---
#### 📦 Workload Migration Common Procedures

---

#### 🛠️ Key Preparation Steps

- **Extensive planning** is required before migrating any workload.
    
- Only migrate apps that are tested and **proven interoperable** with the cloud environment.
    
- **Set up a test environment** to ensure the app works before moving it into production.
    

---

#### ✅ What to Validate Before Migration:

- **Performance**
    
- **Service levels & uptime**
    
- **Serviceability**
    
- **Compliance**
    
- **Security**
    
- Check for **trade-offs** between internal hosting (data center) vs. cloud.
    

---

#### 👥 Project Management & Collaboration

- Migration must be **led by a project manager**
    
- All relevant departments should **collaborate actively**
    
- **Best practices** must be followed to ensure a smooth, stable migration.
---

## 🧠 2.X – Examining Infrastructure Capable of Supporting a Migration

### 🔌 Available Network Capacity

- **Critical for planning** — especially for online migrations.
    
- **Low bandwidth = long transfer times** → may require buying more bandwidth or switching to offline migration.
    
- Must calculate **how much data** is being migrated and **how long it’ll take** with current capacity.
    

---

### 🕐 Downtime During the Migration

- **Some downtime is inevitable** — plan for it.
    
- Strategies to reduce downtime:
    
    - Use **prototype cloud builds** before cutting over.
        
    - **Test VMs** or apps in the cloud to resolve bugs early.
        
- Always include **buffer time** in case of failure or rollback.
    

---

### ⚖️ Legal & Regulatory Considerations

- Investigate:
    
    - **Compliance requirements**
        
    - **Data sovereignty laws**
        
    - **Licensing impacts**
        
- Must be addressed during **pre-migration planning** — not as an afterthought.
    

---

### 🌍 Time Zones & "Follow-the-Sun" Support

- Be careful when migrating **across time zones** to avoid impacting operations unnecessarily.
    
- **Follow-the-sun model** = global support teams in different time zones hand off to each other.
    
    - Reduces downtime and improves coverage.
