## 🧠 Lesson 2.3 – Migration Types: On-Premises to Cloud

> Moving data, apps, and workloads to the cloud is called **migration**. The type of migration depends on tech limitations, business needs, and goals.

---

### 🚚 On-Premises to Cloud Migration

#### 🔍 Definition:

Migrating infrastructure, applications, and data from **physical servers** (on-premises) to **cloud infrastructure** (like AWS, Azure, GCP).

#### 🎯 Why It’s Popular:

- Avoids hardware upkeep
    
- Cuts operational expenses
    
- Boosts scalability + flexibility

### 📌 Key Considerations

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|**Scalability & Flexibility**|Cloud platforms offer **on-demand resources**, adapting to business needs (scale up/down).|
|**Cost Saving**|Pay-per-use pricing model saves money over time—no wasted capacity.|
|**Security & Compliance**|Sensitive data must be handled carefully to meet **security** and **regulatory** standards.|
|**Risk Management**|There's always a chance of downtime. Planning minimizes disruption and ensures smooth transition.|

### ☁️➡🏢 Cloud to On-Premises Migration

> Not all roads lead to the cloud. Sometimes, businesses _reverse migrate_ services back to on-premises.

#### 🔑 Key Considerations

|Consideration|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Regulatory / Legal Constraints**|Some industries (like healthcare or finance) require **on-prem storage** to comply with laws.|
|**Latency Issues**|Real-time apps (e.g., trading platforms) may perform **better on-prem** than over cloud networks.|
|**Cost of Cloud Operations**|Cloud costs may exceed on-prem costs if resource usage is constant or heavy.|
|**Hybrid Method**|Some companies blend both cloud + on-prem—**hybrid deployments**—to get the best of both worlds.|
### ☁️➡☁️ Cloud-to-Cloud Migration

> In multi-cloud strategies, orgs move between providers for better pricing, services, or capabilities.

#### 🔑 Key Considerations

| Consideration                     | Explanation                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vendor Lock-In**                | Proprietary tech makes switching **difficult**. A flexible architecture helps.            |
| **Data Transfer Latency & Costs** | Transferring large datasets = $$$ and can be **slow**, depending on data center location. |
| **Re-architecting Applications**  | Code may need **tweaks** to work with the new provider (features, APIs, services).        |
| **Downtime Implications**         | Always plan migrations **off-peak** to minimize impact from any downtime.                 |
