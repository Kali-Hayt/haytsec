#### ✅ Overview

To protect cloud resources, you must control who gets in (_authentication_) and what they can do once inside (_authorization_). It's a balance — too strict, and users get blocked; too loose, and you're open to threats.

#### 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Authentication**  
    Verifying _who_ a user is.  
    _Example: Username + password, biometrics, or smart cards._
    
- **Authorization**  
    Granting permissions — what the authenticated user _can_ do.  
    _Example: Read-only access vs. admin rights._
    

#### 🛡️ Topics Covered in This Section:

- Role-based access rights (RBAC)
    
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC) vs. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
    
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**: Requiring multiple verification methods for access.
    
- **Federation**: Trusting external identity systems for login access (e.g., logging in with a Google account to a third-party app).
    

---
### 👥 RBAC: Identifying Users and Their Roles

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** grants or restricts access based on the user's job role within the organization. Each **role** includes a collection of permissions that determine:

- What actions the user _can or cannot_ perform
    
- What **resources** those actions apply to
    

Once roles are defined, users are assigned to them and automatically inherit their permissions.

#### 📋 Example RBAC Roles

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|**Administrator**|Full control over the cloud environment|
|**Auditor**|View-only access for audits — licenses, usage stats, compliance data|
|**Patch Management**|Rights to apply software upgrades and patches|
|**Storage Administrator**|Rights to manage cloud storage (monitoring, configuration, maintenance)|

---
### 🔐 What Happens When You Authenticate?

**Authentication** is how a system verifies _you are who you say you are_. Once verified, the system can assign permissions based on your identity.

#### 🔑 Typical Authentication Methods

- **Username + Password** (most common)
    
- **Token-based** (e.g., one-time passcodes, TOTP)
    
- **Biometric** (e.g., fingerprint, face scan)
    
- **Access Cookies** (used in web applications to track authenticated sessions)
    

Once authenticated:

- A **cookie** or **token** is stored in your browser to maintain identity.
    
- For **applications**, authentication often uses a cloud provider's **API** and a **security token** assigned to a role.
    

> ✅ Once you're authenticated, the system moves on to **authorization** — deciding what you're allowed to access or do.

---
### 🤝 Understanding Federation

**Federation** = Using a **third-party identity provider** (like Microsoft Active Directory) to authenticate users into **cloud services**.

This means:

- Users **don’t need separate logins** for cloud resources if they already have corporate credentials.
    
- Makes **cloud migration easier** since existing identity infrastructure can be reused.
    

#### 🌐 How It Works

Federation relies on **industry standards**, especially:

- **SAML** (Security Assertion Markup Language): Enables identity info to be shared between organizations.
    

#### 💡 Real-World Example

- You log into an **e-commerce site**.
    
- That site **federates** identity with **banks** or **payment processors**.
    
- You can check out, manage shipping, and view warranties — all without re-logging into each system.
    

> 🔁 Federation = Single login that works across multiple systems by trusting a central identity provider.

---
### 🔐 Single Sign-On (SSO) Systems

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** = One login → Access to multiple systems.

SSO simplifies authentication by letting users sign in once and gain access to everything they're authorized to use — no more logging into each system separately.

#### 🧠 How It Works:

- One-time login = centralized authentication.
    
- SSO systems use services like **LDAP** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
    
- Once authenticated, users can access all approved systems without re-entering credentials.
    

#### 💡 Example:

A cloud admin manages multiple web servers. Instead of logging into each server, they’re part of an SSO group like "web administrators" and get access to all relevant systems after logging in once.

#### 🏁 Bonus Benefit:

When the user logs out, the SSO system logs them out of **all linked systems**, boosting security and cleanup.

> 🔁 SSO = Login once, access all → log out once, leave no loose ends.

---
## 🛠️ Understanding Infrastructure Services

Infrastructure services = The backbone of cloud networking operations. These services manage and secure how devices and applications communicate.

### Key Components:

- **IP Address Management** – Assign and track network addresses for devices.
    
- **Load Balancing** – Distribute traffic across multiple systems to ensure availability and performance.
    
- **Firewalls** – Control traffic flow and protect against unauthorized access.
    
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** – Monitor and respond to suspicious or malicious activity.
    
- **Security Services** – Broader category that includes antivirus, anti-malware, and data protection tools.
    
- **DNS Services** – Handle domain name resolution (translating names like `example.com` to IPs).
    

> These services make cloud infrastructure functional, scalable, and secure.

---

### 🌐 Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS is like a phone book for the internet: it translates easy-to-remember domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses (like `142.250.190.78`) so systems can communicate.

---

#### 🔁 **How DNS Works**

1. A user requests a website (e.g., `example.com`).
    
2. The **DNS client** on their system sends a query to a DNS server.
    
3. The server responds with the correct IP address.
    
4. The system uses that IP to connect to the desired remote resource.
    

---

#### ⚙️ **Technical Specs**

- DNS runs over **TCP and UDP port 53**
    
    - **UDP** is used for most queries.
        
    - **TCP** is used for zone transfers and larger responses.
        
- Think: “Name-to-IP translation.”
    

---

#### 🔒 **DNS Security Issues + Fixes**

By default, DNS is **not secure** and is vulnerable to:

- **Man-in-the-middle attacks**
    
- **DNS spoofing / poisoning**
    
- **Fake responses (e.g., malicious IP instead of the real one)**
    

##### 🛡️ Security Enhancements:

|Feature|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**DNSSEC** (DNS Security Extensions)|Adds **authentication + integrity**, but **not encryption**. Prevents tampering, verifies response legitimacy.|
|**DoH** (DNS over HTTPS)|Sends DNS queries over **encrypted HTTPS** — hard to inspect, great privacy.|
|**DoT** (DNS over TLS)|Sends DNS queries over TLS (on a dedicated port), making traffic easier to filter in enterprise environments.|

---
### 🧭 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP stands for **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**. It's used to automatically assign network configuration settings to devices on a network so you don’t have to manually enter them.

---

#### 🔧 What DHCP Provides

When a device joins the network, the DHCP server can assign:

- ✅ **IP address**
    
- ✅ **Subnet mask**
    
- ✅ **Default gateway**
    
- ✅ **DNS server info**
    
- ✅ **Lease duration** (how long the IP is valid)
    
- ✅ Optional extras (e.g., NTP server, domain name)
    

---

#### 🔄 DHCP Process (a.k.a. DORA)

1. **Discover** – The client sends a broadcast to find a DHCP server.
    
2. **Offer** – The DHCP server replies with an available IP address.
    
3. **Request** – The client requests to use the offered IP.
    
4. **Acknowledge** – The server confirms and locks in the lease.
    

Think: `D-O-R-A` → Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge

---

#### 🔐 Port Numbers

- **Client listens** on: **UDP port 68**
    
- **Server sends from**: **UDP port 67**
    

> 🧠 _DHCP simplifies networking but can be a security risk without proper controls (e.g., rogue DHCP servers)._

---
### 🔐 Certificate Services (TLS & CA)

Cloud providers offer certificate services to handle the full lifecycle of **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** certificates — used to secure web traffic and verify identity.

---

#### ✅ Key Functions:

- **TLS certificates** encrypt data between client and server.
    
- Used for **authenticating websites**, **load balancers**, and **CDNs** (Content Distribution Networks).
    
- Cloud providers may act as a:
    
    - **Certificate Authority (CA)** → They can issue new certificates.
        
    - **Certificate Manager** → Let you import third-party TLS certificates.
        

---

#### ♻️ Renewal & Management:

- TLS certs **expire by design**.
    
- Cloud services can automatically **renew certificates before expiration**.
    
- This helps prevent service disruption and reduces manual overhead.
    

---

### ⚖️ Load Balancing

**Load balancing** distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.

---

#### ✅ Key Benefits:

- Increases **redundancy** and **scalability**
    
- Improves **availability** and **performance**
    
- Enables **horizontal scaling** by adding more servers behind the balancer
    

---

#### 💡 How It Works:

- The **domain name** resolves to the **IP of the load balancer**, not to individual servers.
    
- The **load balancer** receives traffic and forwards it to a **pool of backend servers**.
    
- It can also:
    
    - **Offload encryption** (e.g., TLS/SSL termination)
        
    - Handle **TCP handshakes**
        
    - Perform **compression**
        
    - Run **health checks** and avoid sending traffic to failing servers
        

---

#### 📈 Example Use Case:

- If you host a website that gets heavy traffic, the load balancer ensures:
    
    - Sessions are distributed evenly
        
    - Traffic is rerouted if a server goes down
        
    - Performance remains stable under load
        

---

### 🔐 Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

**Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** adds an extra layer of security by requiring two or more types of credentials from different categories:

---

#### 🎯 MFA Factors:

1. 🧠 **Something you know** – e.g., password, PIN
    
2. 🛠️ **Something you have** – e.g., key fob, smartphone app, ID badge
    
3. 🧬 **Something you are** – e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition
    

---

#### 🏦 Real-World Example:

Using an ATM:

- You swipe your **bank card** (something you have)
    
- Then enter your **PIN** (something you know)
    

---

#### 🧾 One-Time Tokens:

- Often **numeric or alphanumeric codes**
    
- Generated by an app (e.g., Google Authenticator) or key fob
    
- Valid only for a **short time window**
    
- Must be entered during login
    

---

#### 🔁 Delivery Methods:

- **Physical**: Hardware key (e.g., YubiKey)
    
- **Virtual**: Authenticator apps, cloud tokens
    
- **Fallback**: Email or SMS (less secure, but commonly used)
    

---

#### ⚠️ Risks & Considerations:

- If you **lose your MFA device**, you're locked out and must recover access
    
- **SMS/email MFA** is convenient but more vulnerable to interception
    
- Stronger MFA is preferred in **enterprise/cloud environments**

---
## 🔥 Firewall Security (Cloud+ 2.0)

### 🔍 What is a Firewall?

A **firewall** inspects **network traffic** and compares it against a **rules list** to determine whether the traffic is **allowed** or **denied**.  
If traffic **is not permitted**, the firewall **blocks** it. This is known as a **default deny** behavior, often called **whitelisting**.

---

### 🧠 Key Criteria Firewalls Use:

- **Source IP Address**
    
- **Destination IP Address**
    
- **Protocol Number** (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)
    
- **Port Type and Number** (e.g., TCP 80, UDP 53)
    

---

### ☁️ Cloud-Based Firewalls:

In cloud environments, firewalls often **don’t exist as physical devices**. Instead, the functionality is:

- **Abstracted** into **cloud services**
    
- Applied to **VM network interfaces**, **security groups**, or **firewall rules**
    
- Provisioned as **virtual firewalls** to inspect and filter traffic across cloud boundaries
    

---

### 🔐 Behavior:

- Firewalls only **allow explicitly permitted traffic**
    
- Everything else is **denied by default** unless specifically allowed
    

---

### 🧱 Benefits in Cloud Environments:

- Sits at the **edge of cloud networks**
    
- Can **inspect and log packets**
    
- Can be **centrally managed**
    
- Works with **cloud-native firewall policies**
    
- Scales with virtual infrastructure
    

---

### 🧰 Optional Integration:

You can:

- Deploy firewall **VM appliances**
    
- Integrate with **on-premises firewall management systems**
    
- Apply firewall rules **per network interface**

---
## 🔐 OpenID Connect (OIDC)

### 🧩 What is OIDC?

**OpenID Connect (OIDC)** is an **identity layer** built on top of **OAuth 2.0**. It provides **authentication** and **authorization** for web and mobile apps in a **secure and user-friendly** way.

---

### ✅ What OIDC Does:

- Allows **users to log into applications** using a **trusted identity provider** (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Okta)
    
- Enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)** — log in once, access multiple apps
    
- Uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** to pass identity data securely between systems
    

---

### 🔒 Security Benefits:

- Reduces **password fatigue** and **security risks**
    
- Supports **token expiration** and **refresh tokens**
    
- Uses **claims-based identity verification** for strong authentication
    
- Easy to integrate with existing platforms via standardized **endpoints**:
    
    - Authentication
        
    - Token issuance
        
    - User info retrieval
        

---

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Efficient User Management | Automatically applies access when users join a group         |
| Simplified Onboarding     | New users inherit permissions by group membership            |
| Reduced Overprovisioning  | Limits risk by ensuring users only get access they need      |
| Scalable & Consistent     | Easy to apply policies uniformly across departments or teams |
| Reduced Admin Overhead    | Fewer manual changes = less room for error                   |

---
## 🔐 OAuth 2.0 — Open Authorization Protocol

### 📌 What It Is:

**OAuth 2.0** is an industry-standard **authorization framework** that lets users grant third-party applications access to their resources **without revealing login credentials**.

---

### 🔄 How It Works:

OAuth 2.0 uses a **delegation model**, allowing users to:

- Authorize applications to act on their behalf
    
- Use **access tokens** to avoid storing user passwords
    
- Safely connect web/mobile apps to secure APIs (e.g., Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
    

---

### 🔑 Grant Types:

|Type|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Authorization Code**|Most secure, used in server-side web apps|
|**Implicit**|Used in client-side apps (less secure, deprecated)|
|**Resource Owner Password (ROPC)**|User shares credentials directly (rare, risky)|
|**Client Credentials**|Machine-to-machine communication (no user involved)|

---
