### 🛡️ Establishing a Business Continuity Plan

The first step in implementing any **Disaster Recovery (DR)** offering is to **evaluate your organization's needs**.

Based on the findings, you can:

- Architect a tailored DR plan  
- Ensure it fits your budget and technical requirements  
- Choose a cloud provider that supports your specific needs  

---

### 🧪 Testing & Updating the Plan

Once implemented, it's **critical to test** the DR plan’s design and effectiveness against the documented objectives.

Benefits of testing include:

- 🧩 Identifying unforeseen issues in processes or technology  
- 🔁 Making necessary modifications  
- 🔄 Adjusting for evolving DR needs over time  

📌 *Regular reviews are essential to keep your DR strategy aligned with business changes.*

---
### 🗺️ Determine Alternate Sites

Disaster recovery (DR) site placement should consider **geographical separation** from the primary location.  
🌀 You don't want a hurricane or earthquake wiping out both your primary and backup at once.

- Corporate governance policies often require **physical separation** between DR and primary sites  
- Cloud providers usually offer **regional redundancy** and availability zones  

✅ Additional factors:
- Compliance with regulations like **HIPAA** or **PCI DSS**  
- **In-country data restrictions**  
- Availability of certified providers  

---

### 🔁 Define Continuity of Operations

Business continuity means maintaining operations during or after a disruptive event.

Key considerations:
- What functions must continue?
- What’s the **minimum requirement** to resume operations?
- Which **technical and process gaps** must be filled?

📌 Leadership must:
- Identify what’s needed for business continuity  
- Document operational requirements  
- Align business processes with enabling technology  

---

### 🌐 Addressing Network Connectivity

Your DR strategy must account for **network connectivity** with:
- The **cloud provider**  
- Your **ISP or WAN provider**

Evaluate whether current infrastructure meets business continuity needs.

✅ Action items:
- Require **SLAs** from connectivity providers that guarantee uptime during DR events  
- Plan for **extra bandwidth** needs like data replication or load spikes  
- Upgrade infrastructure if necessary to meet DR traffic demands  

---
### 🌍 Deploying Edge Sites

Large cloud vendors often deploy **points of presence** at key global locations without building full data centers.  
These are known as **edge facilities**.

Edge sites provide:

- ✅ Low-latency connections for local user access  
- ✅ Caching and localized data access at DR locations  
- ✅ Easy provisioning via cloud provider dashboards or APIs  

They’re especially useful when speed and regional access matter.

---

### 🖥️ Procuring Backup Equipment

- **Cloud-based backup sites:** No hardware needed — the provider handles it  
- **Traditional backup sites:** You must buy all the required infrastructure:
  - Servers  
  - Storage  
  - Networking gear  
  - Software/licenses  

⚠️ **Warning:** Equipment may sit unused until disaster strikes and can become outdated or underpowered.

📌 Be careful:
- Don’t cheap out on hardware if it can’t handle the workload under real disaster conditions.

---

### 📶 Recovery Site Availability

Always ask:  
> What if the DR site itself becomes unavailable?

When planning your DR strategy:
- Account for **access restrictions**  
- Identify **alternative plans**  
- Consider **redundancy of the DR site itself**

---

### 🛑 On-Site Access Considerations

- DR facilities are **high-security** locations  
- You need prior approval and clearance to enter  
- Often requires:
  - Advance scheduling  
  - Escorting by staff  
  - Equipment inspection and approval  

🚷 Don’t assume you can just show up and plug in — most cloud data centers **deny unscheduled access**.

---

### 🔒 Facility Visibility & Security

- No flashing signs or labels — **data centers are deliberately inconspicuous**  
- Usually:
  - No company names  
  - Hidden behind fences and cameras  
  - Resemble secure fortresses  

🧭 Bring directions — you probably won’t even recognize the building.

---

### 🧩 Third-Party Disaster Recovery Vendors

A full **disaster recovery industry** exists:

- Some providers run **specialized DR data centers**  
- Others manage the **entire DR lifecycle**, end-to-end  
- Consulting firms offer services to:
  - Design your DR plan  
  - Implement continuity solutions  
  - Maintain compliance and operations  

📈 Great option if you lack internal expertise or want enterprise-level support.

---
### 📄 Establishing Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

An **SLA** is a formal agreement between a service provider and a customer that defines:
- Responsibilities
- Service expectations
- Recovery requirements  
SLAs are critical in disaster recovery planning.

---

### 📘 Disaster Recovery SLAs

A **disaster recovery SLA** includes:
- Business impact evaluation  
- Risk assessments and mitigation planning  
- Definitions of RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)  
- Clarification of **provider vs customer responsibilities**  

SLAs vary depending on the service model:
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service)  
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)  
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service)  

---

### 🧮 RTO & RPO Review

- **RPO:** How much data can be lost during an outage  
- **RTO:** How long it takes to bring a system back online  

SLAs define:
- Maximum downtime allowed  
- Data loss tolerance  
- Recovery response time during a critical event  

More aggressive RTO/RPO = Higher cost

---

### ⚠️ Real-World Failover Realities

You might wish for **instant failover** — but in practice, it’s rarely possible.

In large-scale outages (e.g., power failure or fiber cut), workloads must shift to backup locations.  
This can lead to:
- **Data loss**  
- **Delayed recovery**  
- **Extended outage durations**

---

### 🧩 Infrastructure Activation Sequence

Failover steps must follow a **precise order**:
1. Activate virtual infrastructure at remote location  
2. Ensure data replicas are current  
3. Bring up networking and servers  
4. Restore databases  
5. Connect and verify systems  

Delays in one step can hold up the entire recovery process.

---

### 💸 SLA Cost Considerations

- Tight RTO/RPO = Higher cost  
- Shorter recovery times require more:
  - Resources  
  - Dedicated infrastructure  
  - Pre-provisioned services  

📌 *Balance your SLA expectations with budget realities.*
