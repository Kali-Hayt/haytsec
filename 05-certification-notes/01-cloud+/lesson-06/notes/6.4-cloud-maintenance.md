### 🔧 Maintenance Operations in the Cloud

Maintenance is a constant in any IT operation — cloud included.  
This section focuses on **operational maintenance** rather than hardware-level technical maintenance.

---

### 🔄 Shared Responsibility: Who Does What?

Cloud providers and customers **share responsibility** for maintenance tasks. It’s critical to know:

- **Who** is performing the maintenance  
- **When** it will occur  
- **What** the potential impact will be  

🛠️ With highly redundant cloud architectures, many maintenance events are invisible to customers.

📣 If the **cloud provider** is doing maintenance:
- They post notices on dashboards  
- Send email notifications  
- Provide timeframes and expected impact  
- Send an “all clear” when the job is done  

---

### 🧠 Change Management for Your Cloud Workloads

If you’re handling your own cloud maintenance:

- Always follow a formal **change management process** (see Lesson 2: Cloud Deployments)  
- This reduces risk and provides clear documentation  
- Unplanned maintenance? Then your job is to:
  - **Get systems operational fast**  
  - **Do a postmortem review** when it's done  

📌 *Plan it. Execute it. Document it.*

---
### 🕒 Establishing Maintenance Windows

Your **IT operations team** must define **when** system changes can safely occur.

🧠 These maintenance windows are driven by:
- **Business priorities**  
- **Operational schedules**  
- **Peak load periods**

📌 Example:
- Retailers avoid making changes during the **holiday shopping season**  
- Companies limit updates during **end-of-month** or **quarter-close processing**

✅ Best practice:  
Schedule changes during periods with **minimal operational impact**.

---
### ⚠️ Maintenance Interruptions to Operations

Modern cloud infrastructure uses **virtualization** to spin up or remove VMs rapidly — supporting high resilience.  
However, **you** are responsible for designing a resilient architecture.

If you skip **high availability best practices**, you risk operational impact during maintenance.

---

### ✅ Ideal Design Approach

## 🗑 Orphaned Resources

**Definition:**  
Orphaned resources are unused cloud assets left behind from processes or services that are no longer active or needed. These are typically caused by improper cleanup or oversight during operations.

---

### 💸 Financial Impact
- Cloud assets like VMs, storage arrays, DNS records, or load balancers may continue to incur costs even after the service has ended.
- Example: A VM is deleted, but the storage volume remains and continues to be billed.
- Cloud billing consoles should be regularly reviewed to catch these lingering charges.

---

### 🧠 Organizational Oversight
- Sometimes internal teams don't realize certain resources are inactive.
- These may be billed to the company without anyone actually using them.
- Redundant provisioning increases operational costs unnecessarily.

---

### 🛠 Resource Management Practices
- Identify orphaned assets and:
  - Decommission them.
  - Reallocate them to active projects.
- This cleanup can cut costs and boost operational efficiency.

---

### 📉 Underutilized Resources
- Resources like VMs with unused CPU/memory, or idle load balancers, are considered underutilized.
- Downsizing or adjusting these can lower billing.
- Examples of orphaned resources:
  - Unattached volumes
  - Unused databases
  - Idle load balancers

---

### 🤖 Automation & Monitoring
- Monitoring tools help detect idle or orphaned assets.
- Some cloud providers offer automated analysis tools that:
  - Review usage.
  - Suggest cost-saving adjustments.
  - Improve your cloud security posture.

---
## Orphaned Resources

**Orphaned resources** are unused components left over after a service is terminated or no longer needed.

When deploying cloud resources like:
- VMs
- Storage arrays
- Load balancers
- DNS
- Databases

...it’s easy to forget something got left behind.

**Problem:** These resources often stay **active and chargeable**, even when unused.

**Example:**  
You spin up a VM, delete it — but the attached storage volume keeps running and **continues billing**.

> 🔍 **Tip:** Regularly audit your cloud provider’s billing dashboard. Know what’s running — and why.

---

## Inactive Resources from Other Groups

Different teams may leave cloud resources active — unaware they’re no longer needed.

**Risks:**
- Redundant provisioning
- Unnecessary costs

**With better visibility, you can:**
- 🧹 Identify unused assets  
- 🗑️ Terminate or repurpose them  
- 💰 Cut waste and improve ROI  

---

## Underutilized Resources

These are running — but not pulling their weight.

**Common signs:**
- VMs with low CPU/RAM usage  
- Unattached volumes  
- Idle databases or balancers

🎯 **Goal:** Downsize or consolidate to save money.

---

## Monitoring & Automation

Cloud platforms often include **built-in tools** to flag idle resources.

These tools:
- Review account activity
- Recommend actions
- Highlight cost and security risks

> ⚠️ Automation doesn’t fix things for you — it just tells you where to look.

---

## Firewall Rule Sprawl
