## 📘 8.2 Summary – Cloud Operations & Performance Monitoring

---

## 🧱 Baselines and Metrics

- **Baselines** define “normal” performance for cloud operations.
- By tracking **CPU, storage, network throughput**, etc., you can:
  - Spot issues early
  - See usage patterns
  - Determine if resources need scaling
  - Verify if SLAs are met

- Baselines are:
  - Developed quickly
  - Continuously updated
  - Core to ongoing **cloud health monitoring**

---

## 📈 Scaling Operations

- You learned how to **scale up (vertical)** or **scale out (horizontal)**:
  - **Vertical Scaling**: Add power to a single server
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers
  - **Autoscaling**: Automates horizontal scaling based on load

- The goal: **boost performance while controlling cost**

---

## 📊 SLA Compliance and Adjustments

- Operational data helps you verify **SLA attainment**
- If SLAs no longer align with needs:
  - Upgrade to a better SLA or service class
  - Modify your baseline metrics
- Continuous evaluation is key to staying aligned with business needs

---

## 🧾 Reporting and Dashboards

- Reports cover:
  - Usage
  - Capacity
  - Billing
  - SLA compliance
  - Latency
  - Incidents
  - Availability

- Reports can be exported (Excel, PDF) and tailored for:
  - **Internal decision-makers**
  - **Regulatory or compliance requirements**

- **Dashboards** provide live visual status:
  - Graphs, charts, alerts
  - Displayed in:
    - NOCs (Network Operations Centers)
    - Web browsers for real-time monitoring

---

### ✅ Final Takeaways

- Effective cloud management requires:
  - Solid baselining
  - Scalable architecture
  - Proactive SLA evaluation
  - Clear, customizable reporting
