## 📘 3.3 – Summary: Core Concepts in Cloud Security

### 🔐 1. Information Security

- Security focuses on the **CIA Triad**:
    
    - **Confidentiality** – Keeping data private
        
    - **Integrity** – Ensuring data isn't altered
        
    - **Availability** – Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed
        
- Trade-offs are unavoidable:
    
    - Stronger security often means **reduced convenience**, **slower performance**, and **higher cost**.
        
    - Organizations must find a **balance** that meets their operational needs **without compromising protection**.

### ☁️ 2. Security in Cloud Computing

- **Security is front and center** in cloud environments.
    
- Major focus areas:
    
    - **Encryption** – Protecting data in transit and at rest
        
    - **Authentication** – Verifying identities
        
    - **Authorization** – Granting or denying access
        
- Emphasis on **regulatory compliance**:
    
    - Organizations must meet privacy and security standards (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
        
    - Security **policies and enforcement** are key to staying compliant

### 🛡️ 3. Key Security Concepts

#### 🔒 Encryption

- Protects data from unauthorized access and tampering
    
- Uses **ciphers** for encryption and **hashing** for integrity checks
    
- Hashing lets you detect if data has been **modified** (a hash mismatch = something changed)
    

#### 🔧 Best Practices for Cloud Security

- **Disable unused accounts** – prevents unauthorized access
    
- **Use firewalls** – control inbound/outbound traffic
    
- **Keep antivirus updated** – protects endpoints
    
- **Patch systems regularly** – closes known vulnerabilities
    

#### 👥 User Access Controls

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** – Users get access based on their role
    
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)** – One login to access multiple systems securely
    
- **Authorization** – Grant access only to those who truly need it
