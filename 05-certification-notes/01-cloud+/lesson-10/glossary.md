## Glossary

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
A protocol that determines the mapping of an IP address to the physical MAC address on a local network.

### console port
Serial port for CLI access.

### dig
A Linux command-line utility used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses using a DNS name server.

### federations
Multiple organizations sharing the same application. The federated identity management approach allows all participants to consolidate resources. Users share a common set of policies and access rights across multiple organizations.

### harden
The process of disabling all unused services, ports, and applications on a server to make it as secure as possible.

### ifconfig
A Linux command-line utility used to verify and configure the local network interfaces.

### CloudTrail
A cloud service that captures and audits API activity within an AWS account, offering insight into user activity and security events.

### Cloud Router
A service that facilitates dynamic Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing between on-premises networks and Google Cloud.

### cryptojacking
A cybercrime where attackers use other users' resources to mine cryptocurrency illegally.

### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
The de facto standard for routing traffic between autonomous systems on the Internet.

### software-defined networking (SDN)
An innovative approach to network management that decouples the control plane from the data plane, allowing network administrators to configure and manage network traffic programmatically.

### ipconfig
A Windows command-line utility used to verify and configure the local network interfaces.

### jumbo frame
Ethernet frame larger than the standard 1,518 bytes.

### maximum transmission unit (MTU)
The standard largest Ethernet frame size that can be transmitted into the network: 1,518 bytes.

### netstat
Network statistics utility found in Windows and Linux used to see which network connections are open to remote applications.

### network latency
The delay, or time, it takes for data to traverse a network; the time measurement of a network packet to travel from source to destination.

### nslookup
Windows-based command-line utility used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses using a DNS server.

### ping
A command-line utility that is used to verify that a device is available on the network and to get a reading of the response time at that moment in time.

### privilege escalation
A user or service receiving account privileges that they are not allowed to possess.

### quality of service (QoS)
A general networking term for the ability of the network to provide differentiated services based on information in the Ethernet packet.

### route command
A command-line utility that displays the workstation’s or server’s local routing tables.

### subnet mask
Segments an existing IP address in a TCP/IP network and divides the address into the network and host addresses. Subnetting can further divide the host portion of an IP address into additional subnets to route traffic within the larger subnet.

### Telnet
A virtual terminal application that allows for command-line logins to a remote device.

### tracert/traceroute
A command-line utility used for network path troubleshooting. This utility shows the routed path a packet of data takes from source to destination.

### troubleshooting
The process of diagnosing the cause of impairment and resolving the issue.
