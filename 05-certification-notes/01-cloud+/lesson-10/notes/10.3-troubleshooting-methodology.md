## 10.3 Troubleshooting Methodology

Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing the cause of an impairment and resolving the issue. It compares what *is* happening with what *should* be happening.

### üß± Troubleshooting Steps
- Identifying the problem  
- Establishing a theory  
- Testing the theory  
- Establishing and implementing a plan of resolution  
- Verifying the resolution  
- Documenting the cause and resolution  

### üß± Methodical Approach
- Use a structured process‚Äîespecially for unfamiliar or complex problems.
- Avoid random fixes that might introduce new issues.
- Document everything: what was tried, what worked, what didn‚Äôt.
- Structured methods help reduce repeat mistakes and allow others to understand what‚Äôs been resolved.

## 10.3 Troubleshooting Methodology

Problems can come from config errors, bugs, hardware, attacks, or overloads.  
Troubleshooting compares what *is* happening with what *should* be happening.

### üß± Steps of the Troubleshooting Process

- Identifying the problem  
- Establishing a theory  
- Testing the theory  
- Establishing and implementing a plan of resolution  
- Verifying the resolution  
- Documenting the cause and resolution  

Trying random fixes wastes time. A methodical approach avoids repeated effort and missed causes. A structured process ensures knowledge transfer and proper resolution.

## Identifying the Problem

- Define the issue clearly. User reports may be vague, inaccurate, or misleading.  
- Don‚Äôt rely solely on perception‚Äîcollect **valid and relevant** data.  
- Large orgs with silos may require coordination to get needed insights.  
- Use logs, metrics, or form a ‚Äúwar room‚Äù to unify perspectives.

---

## Establishing a Theory

- Narrow your suspects: don‚Äôt check *everything*.  
- Use the *follow-the-path* method to isolate the fault point.  
- Tools: `ping`, `traceroute`, config diffs, and change management logs.  
- Understand dependencies‚Äîeliminate working components (like a DB used by multiple apps).  
- Building a **plausible theory** is often the most time-consuming step.

---

## Testing the Theory

- Safely apply your theory in a lab or test environment, if available.  
- Reproduce the issue ‚Üí fix ‚Üí validate.  
- If the problem disappears in test, the plan likely works in production.  
- Labs aren‚Äôt always 1:1‚Äîif not feasible, test in production with care and planning.

---

## Creating and Implementing a Plan of Action

- Plan the fix like you would any change: follow change management policy.  
- Involve storage, networking, virtualization, or cloud vendors as needed.  
- If it's outside your scope, escalate it properly.

---

## Verifying the Resolution

- Confirm the issue is truly gone‚Äîdon‚Äôt assume.  
- Check with original reporters.  
- Watch for **intermittent problems** (e.g. once-a-month jobs).  
- Resolution may take time to prove.

---

## Documenting the Ordeal

- Memory fades. Document while it‚Äôs fresh.  
- No need for essays‚Äîstatus dashboard update or quick email may do.  
- Include:
  - What was done
  - Why it worked
  - Any config changes
  - Backups of fixed configs
  - Location of archived settings
