## 7.2 Adding and Removing Cloud Resources  
🧱 Part of ongoing cloud operations is managing resources—scaling up or down—to optimize performance and cost.

---

### 🔍 Determining Usage Patterns

- Usage patterns come from:
  - Collected **metrics**
  - **Baseline data**
- Up-to-date **documentation** helps plan deployment and understand traffic flows.
- **Cloud monitoring tools**:
  - Graph usage metrics over time
  - Reveal trends and traffic behavior
- **Logging + Analytics tools**:
  - Provide insights on usage patterns
  - Help guide resource allocation decisions

✅ Purpose: Identify when and where to scale resources efficiently.

---
### 💥 Bursting

**Cloud bursting** = Hybrid cloud strategy.

- Primary use: **On-premises resources**
- During **high load**, temporarily “burst” into public cloud for extra capacity.
- Ideal when:
  - On-prem is **at capacity**
  - You need **temporary compute power**
- Once demand drops:
  - Public cloud resources are **deleted**
  - Operations return to **on-prem**

✅ Economical solution to handle short-term spikes in workload.

---
### 🔁 Migrating Between Cloud Providers

- Can you migrate between cloud providers?  
  → "Maybe" or "It depends."  
  Requires **engineering effort** + **research**.

#### 🧱 Factors That Affect Migration:
- **Commonality** between providers makes migration easier.
- **Proprietary implementations** can block migration.
- **IaaS** = easiest to migrate.
- **SaaS** = hardest (provider controls the app & data access).

#### ⚙️ Example – Hosted Email Migration:
- Old provider must allow **export** of mailboxes.
- New provider must support **import** of that format.
- **Version mismatches** may require extra steps/tools.

#### 💼 Financial Considerations:
- Avoid **long-term contracts** that create “stranded resources.”
- Review **licensing, costs, and compatibility** before migrating.

✅ Use specialized migration tools to smooth out provider differences.

---
### 📈 Scaling Resources to Meet Requirements

- **Cloud’s key strength**: Utility model — pay only for what you use.
- **Scaling** = Add or remove resources to match workload needs.
- Enables:
  - 📉 **Financial savings** (no overpaying for idle systems)
  - 📊 **Dynamic capacity** (scale up or down on demand)
- Focus of this section:  
  - Different **scaling options**
  - **Techniques** used to match resources to workload in real-time

✅ Bottom line: Scale smart, spend less, stay efficient.

---
### ↕️ Vertical and Horizontal Scaling

**Scaling** = Adjusting resources to meet demand.  
Two main strategies:

#### ⬆️ Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
- Add power to **existing** resources:
  - More **CPU**, **RAM**, or **storage** to a single VM
- Ideal for:
  - **Databases**
  - **CPU-bound systems** (limited by processing power)
- Caveats:
  - Often requires **downtime**
  - May involve **restarts** for upgrades (e.g., adding RAM to VM)

✅ Simple but limited — you can only scale a single machine so far.

---
#### ➕ Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
- Add **new systems** (e.g., more VMs or web servers) to share the workload.
- Requires:
  - **Distributed architecture**
  - Tools like **load balancers** to distribute traffic across systems
- Example: A pool of web servers behind a load balancer.
- Pros:
  - No downtime required
  - More **resilient** than vertical scaling
- Cons:
  - More systems to **manage**
  - May introduce **latency** across nodes

---

#### 🔀 Diagonal Scaling
- Hybrid approach:  
  - Scale **up** for performance  
  - Scale **out** for capacity
- Example:  
  - Use horizontal scaling with load balancing for front-end  
  - Use vertical scaling for back-end databases (which prefer single large instances)

---

#### 💰 Provider Considerations
- Some cloud providers offer better pricing for:
  - Many **small VMs** vs. one large VM
- Trade-offs:
  - One big VM = easier to manage but **single point of failure**
  - Multiple small VMs = more robust but require **distributed management**
- Always compare:
  - Cost
  - Performance
  - Application behavior
  - Scaling flexibility

✅ Choose the right strategy based on your app’s **architecture**, **needs**, and **budget**.

---
---

### 🤖 Auto-Scaling

- Cloud providers support **automated scaling** (vertical or horizontal).
- Based on **custom rules + performance metrics**.
- Example:  
  - If a 20-server fleet stays under 50% CPU for 1 hour, auto-scaling removes servers.  
  - When CPU rises, it scales back up automatically.
- ✅ Enables dynamic, **hands-off optimization** of resource use.

---

### 🌐 Community Cloud Scaling

- **Community cloud** = Shared by users with common needs/interests.
- Scaling capabilities vary widely depending on the provider.
- These providers may specialize in niche or hybrid services.
- 🔧 Important:  
  - All cloud types (public, private, community) are **automated data centers**.  
  - The core capabilities are similar—differences lie in **scale** and **orchestration tools**.

---

### ☁️ Scaling the Public Cloud

- **Public cloud** = Pay-as-you-go model built for **massive scalability**.
- Large providers can:
  - Scale to **thousands of servers**
  - Offer **flexible pricing** options
- Includes advanced **orchestration + automation tools** to simplify deployment.
- Used by vendors to differentiate services through **ease of scaling**.

---
---

### 🧬 Elasticity

- **Elasticity** = The cloud’s ability to dynamically add/remove resources on demand.
- Appears to users as an **unlimited resource pool** (storage, compute, networking).
- Cloud systems scale up/down **automatically** to match workload needs.
- ✅ No need to overprovision for peak traffic; idle capacity is minimized.

#### 💸 Oversubscription Strategy:
- Provision only **just enough** resources for average load (not peak).
- If traffic spikes, resources may get **oversubscribed** = degraded performance.
- Common cost-saving method, applied across:
  - **Compute**
  - **Networking**
  - **Storage**

✅ Elasticity allows agility, but oversubscription balances cost vs. performance risk.

---
---

### 🌐 Extending the Scope of the Cloud

- As organizations grow more comfortable with cloud computing, they often:
  - Deploy more resources to the cloud
  - Migrate on-prem data center resources to cloud
- This expansion is called **extending the scope** of the cloud deployment.

#### 💡 Example:
- A company runs its own **VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)** on-prem.
- Later, it migrates to a **SaaS-based VDI** managed by a cloud provider.
- This shift **reduces** on-prem footprint and **increases** cloud reliance.

✅ Cloud providers encourage this shift with increasing SaaS options, hoping orgs migrate internal apps to the cloud.

---
## 🔄 Understanding Application Life Cycles

All applications follow a pattern over their usable lifetime:
- **Deploy** → **Upgrade** → **Migrate** → **Feature updates** → **Replace** → **Retire**
This is called the **application life cycle**.

---

### 🧱 Key Phases in the Application Life Cycle:

#### 🚀 Deployments
- Define software requirements.
- Perform **testing**, **configuration**, and **validation**.
- If not a COTS app (“off the shelf”), may involve **custom coding**.

#### 🔧 Upgrades
- Occur frequently throughout an app’s life.
- Includes patches, version updates, and enhancements.
- Managed through a **change management process**.

#### 🔁 Migrations
- Move data/apps to new systems or platforms.
- May require **project management** and **format conversions**.
- Part of both the life cycle and the change process.

#### ➕ Feature Additions or ❌ Deletions
- Add new functionality as features are released.
- Remove unused features to **cut costs** (e.g., license fees).

#### 🔄 Replacements
- Replace an old app with a new or different one.
- Requires full **project planning**.
- Normal and expected part of the life cycle.

#### ⚰️ Retirements
- App is removed from service.
- Data is migrated or archived.
- Life cycle ends — usually followed by **new app deployment**.

- May offer better **pricing** or **performance** (e.g., switching from magnetic to SSD storage).
- Stay informed on:
  - New features
  - Cost savings
  - Competitive advantages
✅ Evaluate whether upgrading yields long-term benefit.

---

### ⚖️ Regulatory and Law Changes

- Legal/regulatory changes = **major impact** on operations.
- Affects both **regulated** and **non-regulated** industries.
- Example:  
  - Outdated HTTPS ciphers deprecated → some clients can’t connect.
- Cloud providers try to warn you, but **you must stay alert** and act fast.

✅ Always track compliance requirements—cloud changes can break legacy workflows.

---
## 👥 Managing Account Provisioning

Adding, removing, and modifying accounts is a core IT function.

- Most common triggers:
  - **New hires**
  - **Contractors**
  - Requests usually come from **HR** or a **manager**
- Provisioning can be:
  - 🔧 **Manual**
  - ⚙️ **Automated**
- Each account must have **defined permissions** tied to job roles.

---

### 🔐 Identity Systems

You may encounter:
- **On-prem identity systems**:
  - Example: Active Directory or LDAP
- **Cloud IAM systems**:
  - Identity and Access Management for cloud-based resources

#### 🧱 Account Scenarios:
- If systems are **separate**:
  - You’ll need to provision **two accounts** (on-prem + cloud)
- If systems are **federated**:
  - You only create **one account** that works across both

✅ Goal: Ensure users have seamless access while minimizing duplication and risk.

---
---

### 🆔 Account Identification

Cloud accounts can be identified in various ways:
- **Domain name**
- Long, system-generated **unique ID**
- User-defined **account number**

#### 📋 Management & Billing:
- The **root account manager** should:
  - Maintain detailed records of each account
  - Track for both **management** and **billing**

#### 🏢 Large Organizations:
- Common to have **multiple cloud accounts**:
  - Across different providers
  - Or multiple accounts **within** a single provider
- Can become difficult to manage manually.

✅ Some cloud providers support **billing consolidation**:
  - Combine multiple accounts under a single billing structure.

---
---

### 🔐 Authentication

Authentication = Verifying a user's identity before granting access to cloud resources.

- Typically involves:
  - **Username + Password**
  - May include **MFA**: token, biometric, etc.
- Programmatic authentication (e.g. API calls):
  - Uses an **access key ID** and **secret key**

---

### 🤝 Federations and SSO (Single Sign-On)

#### 🌐 Federated Identity
- Allows external identity systems (like **Active Directory**) to serve as the user database.
- Benefits:
  - No need to maintain **separate cloud accounts**
  - Other orgs/groups can access your cloud via **trusted federation**

#### 🔓 Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Authenticate **once**, access **many services**.
- Common with LDAP-based systems:
  - Authenticate to directory → access all entitled systems without logging in again.
- Advantages:
  - **Centralized** authentication
  - **Less admin overhead**
  - No need to memorize **multiple credentials**

✅ Saves time, simplifies access, and improves security through centralized identity.

---
---

### ✅ Authorization

- Happens **after** successful authentication.
- IAM systems determine what a user is **allowed to do** (permissions).
- Example:
  - A DBA may have full access to manage a database
  - But no permission to manage virtual machines (VMs)

✅ Fine-grained control ensures users can only perform tasks aligned with their roles.

---

### 🔐 Lockout Policies

- Prevent brute-force attacks by **locking accounts** after repeated failed login attempts.
- Example:
  - 4 failed login attempts in 5 minutes → lock account for 30 minutes
- Defined by your **information security team**.
- As a cloud admin, you may need to:
  - **Create**, **configure**, or **enforce** lockout rules.

✅ Helps secure access by reducing the attack surface and enforcing account protection.

---
---

### 🔑 Password Complexity

- Policy usually defined by the **IT security group**
- Weak or old passwords = security risks

#### 🔐 Common requirements:
- Minimum **8 characters**
- Must include:
  - At least one **uppercase** letter
  - At least one **special character**
- **No dictionary words** (non-obvious)
- Enforced **rotation schedule**:
  - Example: Change password every **30 days**

#### ⚙️ Configuration:
- Cloud providers offer password complexity settings in:
  - **User account controls**
  - **Server login dialogs**

✅ Strong, regularly updated passwords help reduce the risk of compromise through brute force or credential stuffing.

---
---

### 🤖 Account Automation and Orchestration

- Automation via cloud provider **APIs** reduces errors and saves time.
- Eliminates repetitive, manual steps in account provisioning.

#### 🛠️ User Account Creation
- Permissions are often tied to **job roles**.
- Scripts can:
  - Prompt for a role
  - Automatically create the account and assign permissions
- Scripts can pull user info from:
  - **Databases**
  - **Text files**
  - **Spreadsheets**
- Automate even more:
  - Create **mailboxes**, **file shares**, **virtual desktops**, etc.

---

### 📜 Resource-Based vs. User-Based Policies

#### 🧍 User-Based Policies:
- Tied to the **user** or group
- Dictates what resources the user can access

#### 📦 Resource-Based Policies:
- Tied to the **resource** itself
- Example: A storage bucket may allow all users read access

#### ⚖️ Precedence Rules:
- **Deny** usually overrides **allow**
- If a user policy allows something but the resource policy denies it → ❌ denied.

---

### 🧹 Removing Accounts

- Part of regular **IT security hygiene**.
- Remove:
  - **Unused accounts**
  - **Stale policies**
  - **Outdated resources**
- Tools can help identify accounts for removal.

#### ⚠️ Disable Before Delete
- Common to **disable** accounts first (rather than delete outright).
- Useful if account may be reactivated later.
- Managed via:
  - **Web UI**
  - **APIs**
  - **Automated scripts**

✅ Automation can flag and handle deactivation, expiration, or deletion events systematically.

---
