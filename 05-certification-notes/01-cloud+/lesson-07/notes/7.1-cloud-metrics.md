## 📍 Monitoring Your Deployment

Monitoring is **essential** for operational success in the cloud.  
Without visibility into your cloud systems, you can’t manage them effectively.

### ✅ Why It Matters:
- Ensures **operational success** and **system uptime**
- Enables **data-driven decisions**
- Tracks performance, failures, and trends over time

### 🛠️ How It's Done:
- **Automated monitoring tools** collect and analyze cloud service metrics
- Data is used to inform **proactive decisions**
- Services allow you to customize:
  - **Which metrics** to monitor
  - **Granularity** of the data (e.g., per minute, per second)

### 🎯 Goal:
Maintain full visibility into your cloud deployment to:
- Prevent outages  
- Optimize resources  
- Improve performance  
- Ensure SLAs (Service Level Agreements) are met
---
## 📏 Baselines in Cloud Monitoring

### 🧱 What Is a Baseline?
- A **baseline** is a reference point used to define what’s “normal” for a system’s performance.
- Establishing a baseline helps detect anomalies, performance issues, or failures during cloud migration and scaling.

### 🕓 How It Works:
- Set a **sampling interval** that’s long enough for meaningful data, but short enough to avoid inaccurate spikes.
- Once collected, any **deviation** from the baseline can trigger alerts or investigations.

### 💡 Example:
- If a database server normally uses **70% CPU** over 10 minutes, an alert might trigger at **95% CPU** usage.
- This helps distinguish normal behavior from performance problems.

### 📊 Use Cases:
- Used for **monitoring, alerting, and threshold setting**
- Helps define a **variance**—the range where deviation is considered problematic.
- Supports **capacity planning** and **trend analysis** using historical data.

### 🛠️ Tools That Help:
- **Performance monitoring software** graphs usage over time.
- **Network discovery tools** document system architecture and track changes based on the baseline.

### 🧠 Why It Matters:
- Enables smart decision-making based on **historic and real-time data**
- Prevents **resource over/underutilization**
- Supports **change management** and system optimization over time
---
## ⚠️ Anomalies in Cloud Monitoring

### 🧱 What Is an Anomaly?
- An **anomaly** is any metric that falls **above or below your established baseline**.
- It represents unusual behavior or potential issues that require attention.

### 🔍 Why It Matters:
- Cloud monitoring systems can **identify anomalies** and trigger **automated responses** or **alerts**.
- Anomalies can signal:
  - Critical service issues
  - Performance degradation
  - Capacity problems
  - Security threats

### 💡 Example:
- A server’s RAM spikes to **75%** for a minute? Might be fine.
- But if it stays at 75% for **several hours**, it’s considered **abnormal**, and monitoring systems can alert you.

### 🔮 Predictive Insight:
- Anomaly tracking helps **predict future requirements**.
- Example: A user's mailbox near its quota could auto-trigger extra storage allocation before it causes a failure.

### ⚙️ Automation:
- Tools can act on anomalies **before users even notice**.
- Reduces downtime and improves proactive system health monitoring.

---
## 🛎️ Alert Methods in Cloud Monitoring

- Cloud monitoring apps detect events that require attention.
- The challenge: how to notify different users across various devices and interfaces.
- Cloud systems use **managed notification services** to solve this.

---

## 🔔 How Notification Systems Work

- When an **alarm is triggered**, a **notification** is published to a **notification service**.
- This service **pushes** alerts to **subscribers**.

### 🧱 Subscriber = Notification Recipient
- Can be:
  - Text/SMS
  - Email
  - Push notification (smartphone/desktop)
  - Another cloud service (🔄 integration)

### ✅ Key Traits
- **Scalable**: Handles alerts across many device types.
- **Push Service**: Sends alerts to endpoints as events happen (not pull-based).

---
## 🧠 Analogy
**Think of it like a fire alarm system**:
- A sensor (monitor) detects smoke (event).
- It rings the alarm (triggers notification).
- The alarm gets broadcast to fire stations, phones, pagers (subscriber endpoints).
---
## 🚨 Alert Triggers in Cloud Monitoring

To trigger an alert, you must:
- Choose **what metrics** to monitor.
- Set **threshold values** that define abnormal behavior.

### 🧱 Common Metrics for Alerts:
- CPU utilization (%)
- Read/write operations
- Packet drops
- Network latency

---

## 🔍 Preventing False Positives

- Use **averaging** over time to reduce noise.
  - *Example*: Average CPU usage over 8 minutes.
  - If >90% over 8 minutes → Trigger alert.
- Benefits:
  - Avoids reacting to short spikes.
  - Prevents unnecessary scaling or cost.

---

## 🔄 Dynamic Thresholds

- Environments change. Thresholds may become outdated.
- Bad thresholds can lead to:
  - Premature alerts.
  - Over-provisioning (spinning up unneeded resources).
  - Unnecessary charges.

---

## ⚡ Event-Based Alerts

- Not all alerts need metrics.
- You can trigger alerts on **events** like:
  - VM termination
  - Unauthorized access
  - Service shutdown

---

## 🧠 Analogy
Setting alert triggers is like setting a thermostat.
- Too sensitive = A/C turns on every time the door opens.
- Too loose = You melt before anything kicks in.
Balance = comfort and efficiency.

---
## 🔗 Event Correlation in Cloud Monitoring

- Cloud resources generate **lots of logs and events**.
- **Event correlation** = The process of analyzing how those events are connected.
- Helps you see:
  - How resources interact
  - Which event caused others (root cause)

---

## ⚙️ Why Automate It?

- A single event can trigger a **cascade** of others.
- Sorting them manually is error-prone and time-consuming.
- The more cloud services you run, the more **log noise** you'll get.

---

## 🧪 Real-World Example

**Scenario**:
- Someone misconfigures a NACL (Network ACL).
- App server can’t reach backend database.
- Results:
  - Web servers throw "no response" alerts.
  - App servers time out.
  - DB logs show 0 reads/writes.
  - Dozens of alarms go off!

**With correlation**:
- The system links all those symptoms back to the **root cause**:
  - ❌ NACL blocked the DB.
- Saves time, resources, and false escalations.

---

## 🧠 Analogy
Think of it like a detective connecting clues.
- The broken window (log)
- The barking dog (alert)
- The missing wallet (impact)
The detective (event correlation tool) pieces it all together to catch the burglar (root cause).

---

## ✅ Value of Event Correlation

- Reveals **root causes**, not just symptoms.
- Reduces false alarms and wild goose chases.
- Especially critical in **large cloud deployments** with lots of interconnected systems.
---
## 📈 Forecasting Cloud Resource Needs

Once you’ve established baselines, you can use them to:
- Predict future resource demand
- Add/remove cloud resources **proactively**
- Avoid waste and ensure availability

---

## 🧱 How It Works

- **Metrics** (like CPU, memory, latency) are tracked over time.
- Patterns in usage help forecast future needs.
- Accurate forecasting = smarter cost and capacity planning.

---

## ⚙️ Automatic vs Manual Scaling

### ✅ Automatic Scaling
- Cloud providers can:
  - Track resource usage in real-time
  - Automatically spin up/down resources as needed
- *Example*: High DB query latency? Add a read replica.
  - Usage drops? The replica is removed.

### 🛠️ Manual Scaling
- Admins can analyze trends from monitoring data.
- Use that data to:
  - Manually provision more servers
  - Remove unused ones
- Still valuable for forecasting when automation isn’t in place.

---

## 🧠 Analogy
Think of it like stocking shelves at a store:
- You track how fast items sell (baseline).
- If demand spikes (trend), you order more.
- If sales slow down, you stop restocking that item.
---
## 🗂️ Event Collection Policies

Setting up event collection manually for each device:
- Is time-consuming 🕒
- Increases risk of errors ❌
- Creates admin overhead 📋

---

## ✅ Policy-Based Event Collection

Most cloud platforms let you:
- Define event collection **policies** once
- **Apply them to multiple resources**
- Automate configuration via scripts or orchestration tools

### 🧱 Example Policy
- Trigger a syslog alert when:
  - A storage volume hits **75% capacity**
- This policy can then be:
  - Reused across all storage volumes
  - Applied automatically as volumes are created/migrated

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

- Cuts down repetitive work
- Enforces **standardized behavior**
- Reduces management burden
- Ensures **event logging is consistent** across deployments

---

## 🧠 Analogy
It’s like writing a fire drill plan once and applying it to every floor of a building.
You don’t reinvent it for each room—you apply the same rules wherever they fit.

---
## 📤 Event Dissemination Policies

Logging systems can do more than just collect data—they can also **route** it.

### 🧱 Dissemination = Fan-out
- Forward logs to different systems based on:
  - **Event type** (e.g. login, network error)
  - **Target system** (e.g. big data tool, SIEM, compliance archive)
- Dissemination policies let you:
  - **Filter** what gets forwarded
  - **Control** where the data goes

---

## 🌍 Example Use Case

- A big data analytics platform needs to know:
  - Which countries are accessing which files.
- A **dissemination policy** forwards just that info to the analytics system.
- This keeps logs lean and targeted per system need.

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs to Consider

- **More data = more cost** (storage, analysis, retention).
- **Less data = less insight**, but easier management.
- ✅ Best practice: Collect what you **must**, **not everything**—unless regulation says otherwise!

---

## 🧠 Analogy
Think of dissemination policies like a post office sorting center:
- One event (letter) gets routed to multiple departments (destinations).
- Some letters go to billing, others to legal, others to analytics.

---
## ☁️ Cloud Support Agreements

### 🧾 Free (Tier 1) Support
- Most cloud providers offer **basic support for free**, including:
  - Email-based assistance
  - Community forums
  - Online documentation

    - Or 24/7 availability
  - ⚙️ **Custom maintenance windows** with response times tied to severity levels

---

## 🧠 Analogy
Think of cloud support tiers like airline tickets:
- Economy (free): Self-check-in, long lines, no perks
- Business class (paid): Priority boarding, faster service, direct contact

---

## ✅ Summary
- You get what you pay for.
- Free = basic, slow, self-service.
- Paid = responsive, hands-on, tailored to your environment’s uptime nee
---

Change management involves:
- Recording the change
- Planning (implementation, rollback/backout)
- Testing the change
- Getting approval
- Documenting everything
- Validating that it worked
- (Optional) **Post-change review**

---

## 🧱 What’s in a Change Request?

A formal change request usually includes:
- Name of requester
- Reason for the change
- Description of the change and expected result
- **Risk assessment**
- Required resources
- People responsible for:
  - Design
  - Configuration
  - Deployment
  - Validation

---

## 🧠 Analogy
It’s like planning a rocket launch:
- You don’t “just do it”
- You test, rehearse, document, and have a fallback plan
- And if it works? You log that success and apply it again later

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway
Change management ensures **reliability, accountability, and traceability**—especially critical in production cloud environments.

---
## 🧑‍⚖️ What Is the CAB?

The **Change Advisory Board (CAB)** is a group that supports the change management process by:

- Reviewing proposed changes
- Sequencing and prioritizing them
- Approving or rejecting changes
- Ensuring changes are planned and resourced correctly

🎯 **Goal**: Manage risk and ensure changes are necessary, non-conflicting, and well-executed.

---

## 🧱 What the CAB Does

- Meets with all parties involved in the change
- Evaluates each **change request**
- Ensures no conflicts exist
- Assigns time windows for change deployment
- If approved, issues a **change approval**

---

## 🔍 Ongoing CAB Duties

- Advises teams on:
  - Guidelines
  - Priorities
  - Implementation timelines
- May conduct:
  - **Post-implementation reviews**
  - **Postmortems** after failed changes

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of the CAB like **air traffic control**:
- All changes (flights) must be cleared before takeoff
- They manage the “sky” (schedule) to avoid crashes (conflicts)

---
## 📑 What Are Action and Backout Plans?

- Every change request should include a **step-by-step action plan**.
- Also include a **backout (rollback) plan** in case things go sideways.

🛠️ Plans must include:
- CLI commands or GUI steps
- Expected outcomes
- Verification steps
- Timing—must fit within the allocated **maintenance window**

**⚠️ No guesswork allowed during change time. Everything must be pre-documented.**

---

## 💾 Use of a CMDB

**CMDB = Configuration Management Database**

- Automates tracking and documentation
- Stores:
  - Inventory of cloud resources
  - Change history
  - Backout procedures
  - Custom fields for specific documentation

✅ Many cloud providers offer CMDB functionality as part of their services.

---

## 🧮 Don’t Have a CMDB?

- No worries—**a spreadsheet can work too**.
- Track actions, results, and rollback plans manually.
- The point is:
  > **Document and track everything—regardless of tool.**

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Imagine performing surgery without a chart or exit plan.

- You must know the steps *in* and *out* before you make the first cut.
- Same goes for cloud changes—document or risk disaster.

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

Backout planning isn’t optional.
- It’s the safety net that protects uptime.
- Good documentation = confidence under pressure.
