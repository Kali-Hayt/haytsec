## 10.1.6 Key Management

Key management is the **operational backbone** of encryption systems. It handles how encryption keys (symmetric or asymmetric) are generated, stored, revoked, and rotated.

> ✅ Good crypto means nothing if your key management sucks.

### 🔁 Key Lifecycle Stages

1. **Key Generation**
   - Creates a symmetric key or an asymmetric key pair (public/private)
   - Must use a **strong cipher** with adequate key length

2. **Storage**
   - Keys must be protected from:
     - Unauthorized access
     - Loss or corruption
   - 🔐 Often encrypted at rest (stored in key vaults or HSMs)

3. **Revocation**
   - Revokes a key if it's:
     - Compromised
     - No longer needed
   - ❗ Any data encrypted with that key must be **re-encrypted** with a new one

4. **Expiration and Renewal**
   - Every key/certificate has a **lifetime**
   - After expiration, renew:
     - With same key (not ideal)
     - With a **new key pair** (preferred)

### 🏗️ Key Management Models

#### 1. **Decentralized Key Management**
- Keys are generated locally (e.g., on user machines)
- ✅ Easy to deploy
- ❌ Harder to detect compromise
- ❌ Less control over storage

#### 2. **Centralized Key Management**
- Uses a **Key Management System (KMS)** or appliance
- Central authority generates, stores, revokes keys
- Secure communication is handled using:
  - **KMIP** — Key Management Interoperability Protocol

### 🔑 KMIP (Key Management Interoperability Protocol)

- Open standard
- Allows applications/devices to communicate with a central KMS
- Supports:
  - Key generation
  - Storage and retrieval
  - Revocation and lifecycle management

> 📡 Think of KMIP as the universal translator for key requests between devices and your key server.
