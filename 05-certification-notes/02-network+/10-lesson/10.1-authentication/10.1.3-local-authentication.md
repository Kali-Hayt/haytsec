## 10.1.3 Local Authentication

Local authentication verifies a user's identity **before** launching a shell or interactive session. This is a **core OS feature**, managed by an **authentication provider** (software responsible for checking credentials).

> 🧱 Think of it like the bouncer at the club—your system won’t even let you in until you prove you belong.

### 🧱 Default: Knowledge-Based Authentication

Most OSes rely on **passwords or PINs**:
- These are knowledge factors (something you know).
- They’re **not stored as plaintext**—they’re hashed.

---

### 🧱 Cryptographic Hashing

- A hash function converts input (like a password) into a **fixed-length, irreversible string**.
- The stored value in the credential database is this **hashed version**.
- At login:
  - The input password is hashed.
  - The hash is compared to the stored one.
  - ✅ Match = access granted.

> 🔐 Hashes **can’t** be reversed—this is what makes them secure… unless the password is weak or the hashing algorithm is outdated.

## 🪟 Windows Authentication

Windows uses multiple scenarios and components to authenticate:

### - **Windows Local Sign-In**
- Uses **Local Security Authority (LSA)**.
- Compares password hash against **SAM (Security Accounts Manager)**.
- This is also known as **interactive logon**.

### - **Windows Network Sign-In**
- LSA passes credentials to a network service.
- Uses **Kerberos** (preferred) or **NTLM** (legacy).

### - **Remote Sign-In**
- Used when off-network (VPN, remote desktop, etc.)
- Credentials passed securely to authenticate across networks.

## 🐧 Linux Authentication

### - **Local Sign-In**
- Usernames: stored in `/etc/passwd`
- Password hashes: stored in `/etc/shadow`
- On login: password is hashed and compared to `/etc/shadow`

### - **Network Sign-In**
- Done via **SSH**.
- Can use cryptographic key pairs instead of passwords.
- Private key proves identity.

### - **PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)**
- Framework that allows different auth types (e.g., smart cards).
- Flexible, modular design—can integrate network authentication too.

> 🔍 Want to enforce smart card login or tie into LDAP in Linux? You’ll be configuring PAM.
