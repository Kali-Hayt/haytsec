## 10.1.1 Access Control

Access control governs how **subjects (users, devices, or processes)** interact with **objects (resources like files, systems, or services)**. It's a pillar of logical security and is typically managed through **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**.

IAM breaks access control into four key functions, known as **IAAA**:

---

### üß± Identification
- Purpose: Establish *who* or *what* is trying to access the system.
- Example: Creating a user ID or account.
- Analogy: Like showing your face at the front desk.

---

### üß± Authentication
- Purpose: Prove that the subject is who/what it claims to be.
- Common methods:
  - Passwords (something you know)
  - Tokens or certificates (something you have)
  - Biometrics (something you are)
- Analogy: Showing your ID card or providing a fingerprint.

---

### üß± Authorization
- Purpose: Define *what* the subject is allowed to do after authentication.
- Models:
  - **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** ‚Äì owner decides access
  - **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** ‚Äì system-enforced rules
- Example: Access to specific files or services based on role.
- Analogy: Getting a badge that says which rooms you're allowed into.

---

### üß± Accounting (a.k.a. Auditing)
- Purpose: Track the use of rights and actions taken by subjects.
- Includes:
  - Logging access attempts
  - Detecting unauthorized actions
  - Alerting on suspicious behavior
- Analogy: The security camera and guestbook‚Äîrecords everything you do.

## üîç Practical Example: E-Commerce Site

### Identification
- Verify users are real (match billing/delivery addresses).
- Prevent fake or fraudulent accounts.

### Authentication
- Ensure users have unique accounts.
- Let them manage orders/billing securely.

### Authorization
- Control access to features like order placement, promos, or loyalty content.
- Only allow actions if valid payment is on file.

### Accounting
- Track everything a user does (order attempts, edits).
- Useful for troubleshooting or fraud detection.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Reminder:** These processes apply to both **people and systems**. For instance, your **server must authenticate itself** when users connect via web browsers.
