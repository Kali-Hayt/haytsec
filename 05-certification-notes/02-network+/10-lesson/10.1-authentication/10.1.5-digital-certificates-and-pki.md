## 10.1.5 Digital Certificates and PKI

### 🔐 What Are Digital Certificates?

Digital certificates are used to:
- **Authenticate identities** (users, devices, servers)
- **Secure transmissions** (e.g., HTTPS via TLS)
- **Enable encrypted login** with smart cards or Kerberos

They rely on **public key cryptography**, also called **asymmetric encryption**.

### 🔑 How Asymmetric Encryption Works

Every entity (user or system) has a **key pair**:
- **Public key** (shared with others)
- **Private key** (kept secret)

You can:
1. **Encrypt a message using the recipient’s public key**  
   → Only their private key can decrypt it.
2. **Sign a message using your private key**  
   → Anyone can verify the signature using your public key.

> 🔁 One encrypts, the other decrypts. But you can’t reverse-engineer a private key from its public counterpart.

### ⚡ Note on Performance

Public key encryption is **slow**, so it’s usually used to encrypt a **symmetric key**, which then encrypts the actual message.  
> This is the **hybrid encryption model** used in TLS/SSL.

---

### 📜 Digital Signatures

- Use your **private key** to sign a message.
- Recipients use your **public key** to verify that *you* sent it.
- This proves **integrity** and **authenticity**.

## 🧱 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

PKI solves a critical problem:  
> “How do I know this public key actually belongs to who they say it does?”

### Solution: Digital Certificates + Certificate Authorities

- A **Certificate Authority (CA)** issues a **digital certificate**
- That cert:
  - Proves ownership of a public key
  - Contains identity details + CA signature
- CAs are trusted, so their signature means the key is valid

> 🛡️ Digital certificate = your cryptographic passport

---

### 🔍 The PKI Trust Model

- The CA's job is to verify identity before issuing a cert.
- The certificate is signed using the **CA's private key**
- Anyone with the CA’s **public key** can verify the cert is legit.

---

### 🚧 Self-Signed Certificates (The Wild West)

- Generated without a trusted CA.
- Common in:
  - SOHO routers
  - Test/dev environments
- Browsers flag these as **untrusted**
- ✅ Okay for internal use  
- ❌ Not for protecting critical infrastructure

## 🧪 Recap Examples

- **TLS/HTTPS**: Server sends digital certificate to prove it owns the domain and encrypt the connection.
- **Smart Cards**: Store digital cert + private key. Used with Kerberos or login systems.
- **Email Signing**: Use private key to sign email → recipients verify using public key in your cert.
