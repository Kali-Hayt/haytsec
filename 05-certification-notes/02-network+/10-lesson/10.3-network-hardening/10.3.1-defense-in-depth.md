## 10.3.1 – Defense in Depth

### 🧱 Perimeter Security Model (Traditional)

- Firewalls build a secure **boundary** at the **network perimeter**.
- The goal: Control connections between **private (internal)** and **public (external/third-party)** networks.
- Example: A host from a public network can only join the private network **after authenticating through a VPN**.
- This is a **trust-the-inside** model: If it's internal, it's trusted.
- Known as the **perimeter security model**.

### ❌ Limitations of Perimeter-Only Security

- Rise of **mobile devices**, **cloud**, and **remote access** weakens perimeter-only defense.
- Attackers can bypass perimeters with:
  - Compromised devices (laptops, phones)
  - Insider threats
  - Malware and phishing
- Result: Confidence in perimeter-only defense has **eroded**.

### ✅ Defense in Depth (Modern Approach)

- **Multiple layers** of security spread across the network.
- Every access point, system, and device is:
  - **Authenticated**
  - **Authorized**
  - **Audited**
- Focus is **not just the edge** — **controls are everywhere**.

### 🔐 Components of Defense in Depth

- **Logical access controls** (IAM, permissions)
- **Deception technologies** (honeypots, decoys)
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**
- **Endpoint security** (hardened devices, local restrictions)

### 🧭 Changing Network Perimeter

> "The network edge has shifted."

- Perimeter used to be just the firewall/router border.
- Now includes:
  - Access switches
  - Wireless access points
  - Cloud endpoints
- Many of these are **inside** the new threat perimeter and must be **protected like external systems**.

### 🧠 Summary

The old “castle wall” model (perimeter-only) is no longer enough. In the real world, attackers don’t always try to break the wall — they walk in the front door (phishing, BYOD, insider threats). **Defense in depth** builds **layers** so that if one fails, others catch the breach.
