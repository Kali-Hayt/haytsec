## 10.3.5 – Lab: Scan for Unsecure Protocols

### 🧠 Objective

As a security analyst, perform **external reconnaissance** on `www.partnercorp.xyz` to identify potentially vulnerable **FTP or Telnet** ports using WHOIS, `nslookup`, and Zenmap.

---

### ✅ Lab Completion

- **Score:** 100%
- **Time Spent:** 10:37
- All required tasks and questions completed successfully.

---

### 🖥️ Steps Performed

#### 🔎 Step 1: Discover Name Servers (WHOIS)
- Tool: [https://whois.org](https://whois.org)
- Domain: `partnercorp.xyz`
- Name server identified: `ns1.nethost.net`
- **Q1 Answer:** ✅ `ns1.nethost.net`

#### 🌐 Step 2: DNS Resolution (nslookup)
- Tool: Windows PowerShell
- Command:
  ```powershell
  nslookup www.partnercorp.xyz
  ```
- IP Address returned: `73.44.215.1`
- **Q2 Answer:** ✅ `73.44.215.1`

#### ⚙️ Step 3: Port Scan (Zenmap/Nmap)
- Tool: Zenmap
- Command used:
  ```bash
  nmap --top-ports 50 73.44.215.0/24
  ```
- Subnet scanned: `/24` (range = 73.44.215.1–254)
- Found vulnerable host using **FTP (21)** or **Telnet (23)**.
- **Q3 Answer:** ✅ `73.44.215.5`

### 🧠 Concepts Behind the Lab

| Tool | Purpose | Security Use |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **WHOIS** | Reveals domain registration & DNS servers | Footprinting (passive recon) |
| **nslookup** | Resolves domain name to IP address | DNS recon |
| **Zenmap/Nmap** | Scans for open ports | Identify unsecure protocols |

---

### ⚠️ Unsecure Protocols to Watch For

| Protocol | Port | Risk |
|----------|------|------|
| FTP | 21 | Unencrypted credentials |
| Telnet | 23 | No encryption; easily sniffed |
| SMTP (unencrypted) | 25 | May expose mail relays |
| SNMP v1/v2 | 161 | Unencrypted monitoring info |
| HTTP | 80 | Data in plain text |

---

### 🔐 Real-World Follow-Up

- Recommend replacing:
  - **FTP ➜ SFTP or FTPS**
  - **Telnet ➜ SSH**
  - **HTTP ➜ HTTPS**
- Log and report any open unencrypted services on public-facing hosts.
