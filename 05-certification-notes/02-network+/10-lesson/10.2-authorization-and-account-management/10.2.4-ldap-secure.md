## 10.2.4 – LDAP Secure (LDAPS)

### 🧱 The Problem with Plain LDAP

- Standard LDAP has **no built-in security**.
- All data (including usernames & passwords) is sent in **plaintext**.
- Vulnerable to:
  - 🕵️‍♂️ Sniffing and spoofing
  - 🧨 Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks from anonymous access

---

## 🔐 Authentication Methods for LDAP

### ❌ Simple Bind
- Client sends **Distinguished Name (DN)** + **password**
- **Passed as plaintext** — not secure

---

### 🔐 SASL – Simple Authentication and Security Layer
- Framework that supports:
  - Negotiation of **authentication & encryption** settings
  - Secure mechanisms like **Kerberos**
- Supports **STARTTLS** command to:
  - Upgrade plain connections to **encrypted**
  - Add features like **signing** (integrity) and **sealing** (encryption)

---

### ✅ LDAP Secure (LDAPS)

- Uses **TLS encryption** with a **digital certificate**
- Authenticates:
  - The **server** (via cert)
  - The **client’s LDAP credentials**
- Default port: **636**
- Fully encrypted from the start

---

## 🔐 Hardening LDAP Servers

- 🔒 Disable **anonymous** and **simple bind** unless secured
- 🔐 Use **LDAPS** or **STARTTLS** only
- 🔥 Block LDAP ports (389 TCP/UDP) on **public interfaces**
- 📡 LDAP server should be **internal-only**, unless it’s a public service

---

## 🧱 Access Levels in LDAP

- **Read-only access** (query)
- **Read/write access** (update)
- Controlled via **access control policies**
- Details may vary depending on vendor (not standardized in LDAP)

---

### ℹ️ Note on SSL

> LDAPS is sometimes called *“LDAP over SSL”* — but that’s outdated.  
> ✅ Modern LDAPS uses **TLS**, not SSL.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Use LDAPS (636)** or **STARTTLS** with port 389 to protect directory communication
- Avoid simple bind unless encrypted
- Always block LDAP (389) from the public internet
- Manage access using policy + encryption + audit
