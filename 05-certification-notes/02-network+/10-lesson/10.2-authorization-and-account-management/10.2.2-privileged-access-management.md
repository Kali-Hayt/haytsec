## 10.2.2 – Privileged Access Management (PAM)

### 🧱 What is a Privileged Account?

- An account with **elevated rights** that can:
  - Configure system settings (e.g., firewall, software installs)
  - Access network appliances, application servers, etc.
- If compromised, it can do **serious damage**.

---

## ✅ What is PAM?

**Privileged Access Management** = policies + procedures + technical controls to:
- 🛡️ Prevent **internal abuse** of powerful accounts
- ⚙️ Mitigate risks from poor authorization setups
- 🔍 Identify and document privileged accounts
- 🔐 Control and manage credentials to access those accounts
- 👁️ Provide visibility into privileged account usage

## 🔍 Core Principles of PAM

### 🔐 Least Privilege

- Users get **only the rights they need** to do their job — no more.
- Reduces risk if the account is hijacked.
- Fights **authorization creep**:
  - Over time, users accumulate extra rights (e.g., by joining more groups).
- Fix it by:
  - 📊 Analyzing workflows to define actual needs
  - 🧾 Running regular audits to trim permissions

> Analogy: “Only give the keys needed for today’s task — not the whole master keyring.”

---

### 🧾 Separation of Duties

- Splits **critical responsibilities** across multiple people to prevent abuse
- Helps stop:
  - Insider threats
  - Ethical conflicts
  - Abuse of power
- Implements **checks and balances** on sensitive systems

> Analogy: “One person approves the payment, another releases the funds.”

## 🧠 Summary

- PAM protects the **most dangerous accounts** in your system.
- Enforces **structure**, **visibility**, and **risk reduction**.
- Works best when paired with:
  - ✅ Least privilege
  - ✅ Strong role separation
  - ✅ Auditing and session recording
