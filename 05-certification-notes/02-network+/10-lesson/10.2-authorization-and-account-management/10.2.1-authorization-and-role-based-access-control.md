## 10.2.1 – Authorization and Role-Based Access Control

### 🧱 What is Authorization?
- Process of granting authenticated users access to network resources.
- Determines **what** a user can do, not **who** they are.
- Controlled by access control models.

---

## 🧱 Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

- Based on **resource ownership**.
- Each resource (file, service, etc.) has an **owner**.
- Owner controls access using an **Access Control List (ACL)**.
- Owner can **assign or revoke rights** for other users.
- ✅ Highly flexible — ❌ but can be messy and insecure in large environments.

### Analogy:
> "DAC is like owning a house. You decide who gets a key and can change your mind anytime."

---

## 🧱 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Organization defines **roles** based on job functions or services.
- Permissions are assigned to roles, **not individuals** directly.
- Users (principals) are assigned to roles and **inherit rights implicitly**.
- Users can’t change ACLs — control is centralized with system owner.
- More **secure and structured** than DAC.

### Analogy:
> "RBAC is like a company issuing ID badges with preset permissions depending on your job title."

## 🔍 Security Group Accounts

- **Bridge between DAC and RBAC**.
- Rights aren’t assigned to users directly, but to **groups**.
- Users gain permissions by joining security groups.
- Users can belong to **multiple groups** and get cumulative permissions.

---

## ❌ Limitations of Group-Based RBAC

- Security groups ≠ true RBAC.
- Group assignment is still **discretionary** (manual).
- True RBAC requires system-controlled, **non-discretionary role assignment**.
- Risk: Admins might **escalate privileges** by assigning roles to themselves.
- Ideal: Users **temporarily inherit** permissions just to complete tasks — not permanently.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **centralized role management**.
- Prevent users from **modifying access control directly**.
- Limit **duration** of elevated permissions.
- Implement **least privilege** and **separation of duties**.
