## Lab Objective
Secure and configure a pfSense network security appliance by updating credentials, adding users, setting session timeouts, and modifying anti-lockout rules.

---

## 🧱 Lab Environment
- Appliance: pfSense
- Access URL: `http://198.28.56.22`

## ✅ Task Checklist

### 1. 🔐 Change Default Admin Password
- Go to: `System > User Manager`

### 2. 👤 Create New Administrative User

### 4. 🔓 Disable Anti-Lockout Rule for HTTP

- Go to: `System > Advanced`
- Protocol: `HTTP`
- Uncheck `Anti-lockout`
- Scroll and **Save**

## 🧠 Notes & Reminders
- **Disabling anti-lockout** could lock you out if HTTP access is broken or removed from firewall rules.
- Always create an **additional admin account** before making risky changes to default access policies.
- Regularly **rotate passwords** and **review session timeout policies** for hardened access control.
