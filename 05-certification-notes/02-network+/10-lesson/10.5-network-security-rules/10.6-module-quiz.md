# QUESTION 1

In the context of defense in depth, which of the following is essential for managing access, deception strategies, and ensuring all access attempts are authenticated, authorized, and audited?

❌ Network speed optimization  
❌ External network monitoring  
❌ Physical security measures  
✅ Logical security controls  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Network speed optimization** is about performance, not security control.
- ❌ **External network monitoring** focuses on observing inbound/outbound traffic, not internal access control.
- ❌ **Physical security measures** are about protecting the physical infrastructure, not managing digital access or logging.

---
# QUESTION 2

Which of the following is a vulnerability that still exists even with restricted access to physical switch ports and hardware?

❌ Increased network latency  
✅ Rogue administrators  
❌ Incompatibility with older network protocols  
❌ Overheating of network equipment  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increased network latency** is a performance issue, not a vulnerability.
- ❌ **Incompatibility with older network protocols** is a compatibility concern, not a security risk tied to access control.
- ❌ **Overheating of network equipment** is a hardware reliability issue, not a security vulnerability.

# QUESTION 3

What is the primary security benefit of implementing MAC filtering on a switch?

❌ It encrypts data transmitted over the network.  
❌ It increases the speed of the network.  
✅ It ensures only authorized devices can connect to specific ports.  
❌ It prevents DDoS attacks.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It encrypts data transmitted over the network** – MAC filtering doesn't handle encryption; that's the job of protocols like SSL/TLS.
- ❌ **It increases the speed of the network** – MAC filtering may add overhead, not boost performance.
- ❌ **It prevents DDoS attacks** – MAC filtering offers basic port security, but is ineffective against large-scale volumetric attacks.

# QUESTION 4

A school district has implemented content filtering to ensure that students are not exposed to inappropriate content while using the school's network. The IT administrator wants to make sure that educational content is accessible while restricting access to adult content, gambling sites, and social networking platforms during school hours.

Which content filtering strategy would best meet the IT administrator's requirements? (Select two. Both answers are part of the same solution.)

❌ Disabling content filtering during school hours to ensure that all educational content is accessible  
✅ Categorizing websites into allowed and blocked categories  
❌ Using regular expression pattern matching to filter all websites except those with educational content  
✅ Applying content and reputation-based filtering to block websites with poor reputation scores  
❌ Implementing URL filtering based solely on the protocol used by the website (http or https)  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Disabling content filtering** – This defeats the purpose of filtering; it exposes the network to risk.
- ❌ **Regex filtering all except educational** – Overly complex and error-prone; not scalable for school-wide use.
- ❌ **Filtering based on protocol (http/https)** – Doesn’t distinguish between content types; ineffective for this goal.

# QUESTION 5

What advantage does the reliable delivery offered by TCP provide for TACACS+?

❌ It allows for faster data transmission speeds.  
❌ It simplifies the distribution of IP addresses.  
✅ It makes it easier to detect when a server is down.  
❌ It reduces the need for encryption.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Faster speeds** – TCP prioritizes reliability, not speed; it's slower than UDP due to handshaking and error-checking.
- ❌ **IP distribution** – That’s DHCP’s job, not TCP’s.
- ❌ **Encryption** – TCP doesn’t provide encryption; TACACS+ handles that separately (via its own encryption mechanisms).

---
# QUESTION 6

Which of the following is NOT a feature of basic Network Access Control (NAC) solutions as described in the context of IEEE 802.1X?

❌ Health policy enforcement  
❌ Machine certificate authentication  
❌ User password authentication  
✅ Automatic network configuration  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Health policy enforcement** – Core NAC feature: verifies patch levels, antivirus status, etc.
- ❌ **Machine certificate authentication** – Common with 802.1X for device-based access control.
- ❌ **User password authentication** – Basic NAC supports username/password with RADIUS and 802.1X.
- ✅ **Automatic network configuration** – That’s more in the realm of DHCP or auto-provisioning, not a native function of basic NAC.

---
# QUESTION 7

What is an access control list (ACL)?

✅ A set of rules that defines what actions are allowed or denied for a resource  
❌ A database that stores user passwords  
❌ A digital certificate that verifies a user's identity  
❌ A list of users who are currently logged into a system  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A database that stores user passwords** – That’s typically a credential store, not an ACL.
- ❌ **A digital certificate that verifies a user's identity** – That’s PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), not ACL.
- ❌ **A list of users who are currently logged into a system** – That’s more like a session/user log, not an ACL.

---
# QUESTION 8

What is the relationship between a Service Provider (SP) and an Identity Provider (IdP) in a SAML implementation?

✅ The SP establishes a trust relationship with the IdP  
❌ The SP issues claims that the IdP validates.  
❌ The SP and IdP operate independently and do not communicate.  
❌ The IdP competes with the SP for user authentication.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The SP issues claims that the IdP validates** – It's the other way around: the IdP issues assertions (claims), and the SP consumes them.
- ❌ **The SP and IdP operate independently and do not communicate** – SAML requires communication between the IdP and SP.
- ❌ **The IdP competes with the SP for user authentication** – They have complementary roles: the IdP handles authentication, the SP provides the service.

---
# QUESTION 9

What should be investigated first if a connection attempt fails even with the host firewall disabled?

✅ The network firewall ACL  
❌ The physical network cables  
❌ The application's code  
❌ The server's operating system  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The physical network cables** – Hardware issues usually show no connection at all, not filtered connection attempts.
- ❌ **The application's code** – The issue is at the network level; app-level investigation is premature.
- ❌ **The server's operating system** – If the OS was the issue, it would likely cause broader symptoms, not just a blocked connection.

🧱 ACLs (Access Control Lists) on the network firewall are a common source of dropped traffic and should be checked early.

---
# QUESTION 10

What is the significance of expiration and renewal in key management?

✅ To provide a "shelf-life" to increase security  
❌ To ensure keys are easily accessible  
❌ To facilitate decentralized key management  
❌ To centralize key generation  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To ensure keys are easily accessible** – Expiration actually limits access to enforce tighter control, not increase availability.
- ❌ **To facilitate decentralized key management** – Expiration and renewal can be applied in both centralized and decentralized systems; not specific to either.
- ❌ **To centralize key generation** – Key expiration isn’t about where keys are generated, but how long they remain valid.

🔐 Expiration is a form of cryptographic hygiene—it limits the exposure window of a compromised key.

---
# QUESTION 11

What does the principle of least privilege entail in the context of PAM?

✅ Granting users only the rights necessary to perform their job  
❌ Providing all users with administrative privileges  
❌ Granting users unlimited rights to perform their job  
❌ Allowing users to determine their access rights  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Providing all users with administrative privileges** – This violates least privilege entirely. It’s a security nightmare.
- ❌ **Granting users unlimited rights to perform their job** – "Unlimited" means unnecessary access, which increases risk.
- ❌ **Allowing users to determine their access rights** – Users often lack the knowledge to evaluate what's secure or appropriate.

🧱 **PAM (Privileged Access Management)** enforces least privilege by limiting elevated rights only to those who truly need them—no more, no less.

# QUESTION 12

You are a contractor that has agreed to implement a new remote access solution based on a Windows Server 2022 system for a client. The customer wants to purchase and install a smart card system to provide a high level of security to the implementation.  
Which of the following authentication protocols are you MOST likely to recommend to the client?

✅ EAP  
❌ MS-CHAP  
❌ PPP  
❌ CHAP  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **MS-CHAP** – Microsoft's version of CHAP, but it’s outdated and vulnerable to brute force attacks. Doesn’t support smart cards directly.
- ❌ **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)** – A framing protocol for transmitting data, not used directly for authentication. Think transport, not auth.
- ❌ **CHAP** – Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol is an older mutual authentication method. No smart card integration.

🧱 **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)** supports modern methods like smart cards, certificates, and biometrics. It’s modular and widely used in secure enterprise environments—perfect fit for this client's goal.

# QUESTION 13

What does "defense in depth" refer to in network security design?

✅ Placing security controls throughout the network  
❌ A single, impenetrable layer of security at the network's edge  
❌ Focusing solely on physical security measures  
❌ Ignoring internal threats and focusing on external attacks  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A single, impenetrable layer at the edge** – That's a perimeter-only mindset, which is outdated. Attackers can bypass it or already be inside.
- ❌ **Physical security only** – That’s just one layer. Defense in depth means combining **physical, technical, and administrative controls**.
- ❌ **Ignoring internal threats** – That’s reckless. Insider threats are real. Defense in depth assumes attackers can be inside, too.

🧱 Defense in Depth = **Multiple layers of security**: firewalls, segmentation, access control, endpoint protection, monitoring, and training—like an onion, not a single wall.

---
# QUESTION 14

How can a deny type of error caused by a firewall be identified?

✅ By users reporting incidents related to data traffic failure  
❌ By disabling all network protocols  
❌ By successfully establishing a connection from both inside and outside the firewall  
❌ By noticing an increase in network traffic  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Disabling all network protocols** – That would disrupt all traffic, not help identify *specific* firewall deny rules.
- ❌ **Establishing a connection from both sides** – If connections succeed, there's no error to detect. You're testing *allow*, not deny.
- ❌ **Increase in network traffic** – A deny rule typically causes a drop or failure, not a surge in traffic.

🧱 Firewalls block based on rules. When legitimate traffic is denied, it usually becomes visible *because users report failures*—like apps not loading or services not responding. That's your first red flag.

---
# QUESTION 15

What is "authorization creep"?

✅ The gradual accumulation of access rights beyond what is necessary  
❌ The immediate revocation of all user rights following a security breach  
❌ A situation where a user's rights are restricted to a single function  
❌ The process of removing user rights over time  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Revoking rights after a breach** – That's an emergency response, not "creep."
- ❌ **Rights restricted to a single function** – That’s actually *least privilege*, the opposite of creep.
- ❌ **Removing rights over time** – That’s pruning, not creeping.

🔍 Authorization creep happens when users gain more and more permissions (usually from role changes or convenience), but old, unneeded access isn’t removed. This violates the **Principle of Least Privilege** and increases risk over time.

---
# QUESTION 16

You are troubleshooting a connection issue where a specific service is not functioning correctly on the network. You suspect that the host-based firewall on the server might be blocking the connection.

What should you do to diagnose the issue?

❌ Upgrade the network cables.  
❌ Disable the network firewall temporarily.  
✅ Attempt a connection with the host firewall disabled.  
❌ Change the service's port number.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Upgrade the network cables**: That’s a physical layer issue. The question points to a software-based firewall issue, not hardware failure.
- ❌ **Disable the network firewall temporarily**: This can introduce risk. Instead, test connectivity with the firewall already disabled as a state—not toggle it without confirmation.
- ❌ **Change the service’s port number**: Changing the port doesn't solve a firewall block. The issue is *verifying* if the firewall is the cause, not sidestepping it.

🧠 Always verify before modifying settings. Don't guess; test.

# QUESTION 17

Which of the following issues is separation of duties specifically designed to prevent within the context of Privileged Access Management (PAM)?

✅ Ethical conflicts  
❌ Network downtime  
❌ Data encryption  
❌ Password complexity  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Network downtime**: That’s a technical operations issue, not something solved by role separation.
- ❌ **Data encryption**: Managed through cryptographic policies, not PAM or separation of duties.
- ❌ **Password complexity**: That's an authentication policy, not a privilege assignment issue.

🧱 Separation of duties = no one person has too much control. It’s about preventing misuse of power, not technical errors.

---
# QUESTION 18

Why is it important to disable unneeded network services on devices?

✅ To reduce the attack surface  
❌ To improve device aesthetics  
❌ To increase the number of available services  
❌ To comply with software licensing agreements  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To improve device aesthetics**: Security has nothing to do with how pretty a UI or device looks.
- ❌ **To increase the number of available services**: You’re disabling services, not adding more.
- ❌ **To comply with software licensing agreements**: That’s a legal/administrative concern, not a direct security tactic.

🧱 Fewer running services = fewer doors for attackers to kick in.

---
# QUESTION 19

What does the term "attack surface" refer to?

✅ The range of potential vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers  
❌ The total number of users in a system  
❌ The graphical interface of security software  
❌ The physical area of a network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The total number of users in a system**: More users might increase risk, but “attack surface” is broader—it’s not just about people.
- ❌ **The graphical interface of security software**: That’s a UI, not a vulnerability scope.
- ❌ **The physical area of a network**: Physical size ≠ exposure to threats.

🧱 "Attack surface" = all the points where an unauthorized user could try to enter or extract data.

---
# QUESTION 20

What problem does public key cryptography solve?

✅ The challenge of secure key distribution  
❌ The high cost of digital certificate issuance  
❌ The difficulty of remembering passwords  
❌ The vulnerability of digital signatures to forgery  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **High cost of digital certificate issuance**: That’s a business/PKI issue, not something public key cryptography itself fixes.
- ❌ **Remembering passwords**: Public/private key pairs replace shared secrets, but don't directly help with password memory.
- ❌ **Digital signatures vulnerable to forgery**: Quite the opposite—public key cryptography enables secure digital signatures.

🧱 Public key crypto solved the age-old problem: *“How do I send you a secret key securely without already having one?”* Now, no pre-shared secrets needed. Just use the recipient’s public key.

---
# QUESTION 21

What does an access key contain when generated by the server's security service for an authenticated user?

✅ The user's username and group memberships  
❌ The user's password and login time  
❌ The user's browsing history and application usage  
❌ The IP address and MAC address of the user's device  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Password and login time**: Passwords are not included in access keys—too risky. Login time might be logged separately, not embedded.
- ❌ **Browsing history and usage**: Not relevant to authentication or authorization context.
- ❌ **IP/MAC address**: That's more for network context; an access key doesn't need this.

🧱 An **access key** is like a temporary identity badge. It says *who* you are and *what roles/groups* you're part of—so systems know what you're allowed to access.

---
# QUESTION 22

According to NIST's latest guidance, is requiring multiple character classes for passwords recommended?

✅ No, it is deprecated.  
❌ Yes, it is strongly recommended.  
❌ Yes, but only for critical systems.  
❌ No, but it is optional.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Strongly recommended**: Outdated view. Complexity rules like mixing upper/lower/symbols are no longer favored.
- ❌ **Only for critical systems**: NIST doesn’t make exceptions here—it changed the standard across the board.
- ❌ **Optional**: It's not just optional—it’s actively **discouraged**.

🔍 **NIST SP 800-63B** now emphasizes **length over complexity**. Encourages **passphrases**, not bizarre mixtures. Why? Because users pick weak passwords when forced into weird rules. Better to let people use *correct-horse-battery-staple* than *P@55w0rd!*

✅ Usability = security.

# QUESTION 23

An online retail company is experiencing slow website performance during peak shopping hours, leading to customer complaints about slow page loads and transactions. The company wants to improve its website's performance and reliability, especially during high traffic periods.

Which proxy server feature should the company implement to address these issues?

✅ Load Balancing  
❌ Encryption  
❌ Data Loss Prevention  
❌ Authentication  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encryption**: Improves data confidentiality, not performance or traffic distribution.
- ❌ **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Prevents sensitive data leaks, not relevant to performance bottlenecks.
- ❌ **Authentication**: Controls access, but doesn’t affect traffic handling or reliability.

🧱 **Load Balancing** distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers. It prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck and ensures **high availability and better response time**, especially during traffic spikes like Black Friday madness.

---
# QUESTION 24

Which of the following is the strongest form of multi-factor authentication?

✅ A password, a biometric scan, and a token device  
❌ Two passwords  
❌ Two-factor authentication  
❌ A password and a biometric scan  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Two passwords**: Still only one factor (something you know), just repeated. Not multi-factor.
- ❌ **Two-factor authentication**: Strong, but not *strongest*. It uses two factors (e.g., password + token or password + fingerprint), but not as robust as three-factor authentication.
- ❌ **A password and a biometric scan**: Two factors (something you know + something you are), which is good—but three distinct factors is stronger.

🧱 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is strongest when it combines **three different categories**:
- **Something you know** (password)
- **Something you have** (token device)
- **Something you are** (biometrics)

The more diverse the factors, the harder it is for an attacker to compromise them all.

----
# QUESTION 25

Which security feature should the administrator implement?

✅ Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)  
❌ BPDU Guard  
❌ VLAN tagging  
❌ DHCP snooping  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **BPDU Guard**: Protects against rogue switches and spanning tree manipulation, not ARP poisoning.
- ❌ **VLAN tagging**: Used to separate traffic logically between VLANs—not for ARP spoofing protection.
- ❌ **DHCP snooping**: Protects against rogue DHCP servers and IP assignment issues—not ARP cache poisoning.

🧱 **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**:
DAI is specifically designed to protect against **ARP cache poisoning** (aka ARP spoofing). It works by validating ARP packets on the network against a trusted DHCP snooping database, blocking malicious ARP replies that try to impersonate other devices on the network.

It's the exact tool designed for the exact attack mentioned. 🎯
