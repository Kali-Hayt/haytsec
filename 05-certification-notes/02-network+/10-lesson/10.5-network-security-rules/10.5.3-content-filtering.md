## Content Filtering

### üîç What It Does
- Goes beyond basic ACLs by filtering based on **application-layer content**, not just IP/port/protocol.
- Can enforce business rules like:
  - Blocking malicious/inappropriate websites
  - Time-of-day restrictions
  - Keyword filtering

> üß± Layer: Operates at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** unlike ACLs (Layer 3/4).

## Types of Content Filtering

### üåê URL Filtering
- Filters based on the **Uniform Resource Locator** in HTTP(S) traffic.
- Elements of a URL:
  - Protocol (`http` or `https`)
  - Domain (`example.com`)
  - Server path (`/admin`)
  - Query string (`?id=123`)
- Can:
  - Block domains known for malware/phishing
  - Enforce corporate usage policy
  - Use **regex** for flexible pattern matching

---

### üß† Content & Reputation-Based Filtering
- Uses **cloud-based or on-prem reputation databases**.
- Scores and categorizes sites based on behavior:
  - ‚úÖ Safe
  - ‚ùå Suspicious or known threats
- Categories include:
  - Social networking
  - Gambling
  - Adult content
  - Webmail
  - File sharing
- Simplifies policy enforcement:
  - Block by **category**, not individual URL.

## üîê TLS Inspection Challenges

- TLS (Transport Layer Security) **encrypts** traffic, which breaks content filters.
- Problem: Proxy can‚Äôt inspect encrypted content directly.
- Solution: **TLS Interception (a.k.a. TLS Break and Inspect)**

### üß± TLS Inspection Process:
1. Proxy presents its **own certificate** to the client (signed by enterprise CA).
2. Proxy decrypts traffic.
3. Proxy inspects/enforces policies.
4. Proxy **re-encrypts** traffic and forwards to destination.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires trusted enterprise CA on client devices, or the client will throw cert errors.

| Filter Type              | Filters On             | Example Use Case                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| URL Filtering            | Domain, Path, Query    | Block `badsite.com` or `/games/` path         |
| Reputation Filtering     | Site Behavior + Category | Block phishing/gambling sites automatically   |
| TLS Interception         | Encrypted content      | Enforce policy on HTTPS without user noticing |
