## ✅ 10.5.10 Lab: Permit Traffic

### 🧠 Scenario
The router was dropping all traffic on `Fa0/0` due to missing `permit` rules in ACL 11. ACLs have an **implicit `deny any`**, which blocks everything unless explicitly allowed.

### 🎯 Objective
- Allow **all other traffic** not explicitly denied by ACL 11.
- Save configuration to the `startup-config` file.

### 🛠️ Commands Used

```bash
# Enter privileged and configuration mode
enable
config term

# Add permit any to Access List 11
access-list 11 permit any
^Z

# Save to startup-config
copy run start
<Enter>  # Confirm building the configuration
<Enter>  # Confirm saving
```

### 💡 Key Concept

Standard ACLs match only **source IP addresses**. Without at least one `permit`, everything is blocked due to the **implied "deny all"** at the end.
access-list 11 deny 192.168.1.10
access-list 11 deny 192.168.1.12

**Without permit any, ALL traffic is blocked.**

### ✅ Result

- Access list now allows all traffic **except** from `192.168.1.10` and `192.168.1.12`.
- Traffic flows correctly through Fa0/0.

Final ACL 11:
deny 192.168.1.10
deny 192.168.1.12
permit any
