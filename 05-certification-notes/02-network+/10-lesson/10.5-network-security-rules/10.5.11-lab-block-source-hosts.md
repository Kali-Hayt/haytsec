# 10.5.11 Lab: Block Source Hosts

## Scenario
You’re managing a small business network connected to the internet through a single router.  
Three remote hosts are **flooding your router with unwanted traffic**.  
You need to block them **temporarily** using a **standard access list**.

---

## Objective
- ✅ Create Standard Access List **25**
- ✅ Deny traffic from:
  - `199.68.111.199`
  - `202.177.9.1`
  - `211.55.67.11`
- ✅ Permit all other traffic
- ✅ Apply the access list to **interface Serial0/0/0** (incoming)

---

## Steps

### 1. Enter Global Configuration Mode
```plaintext
enable
config term
```

### 2. Create ACL 25 and Deny Specific Hosts
```plaintext
access-list 25 deny host 199.68.111.199
access-list 25 deny host 202.177.9.1
access-list 25 deny host 211.55.67.11
```

> 🧱 `deny host X.X.X.X` is shorthand for `deny X.X.X.X 0.0.0.0`

### 3. Permit All Other Hosts
```plaintext
access-list 25 permit any
```

> 🧱 ACLs have an **implicit `deny any`** at the end. Adding `permit any` ensures legit traffic isn’t dropped.

### 4. Apply ACL 25 to the Serial Interface
```plaintext
int s0/0/0
ip access-group 25 in
```

### 5. Exit Config Mode
```plaintext
Ctrl + Z
```

> 🔍 No need to save to `startup-config` — this is a **temporary block**.

---

## Result
✅ Successfully blocked 3 malicious hosts.  
✅ Allowed all other traffic.  
✅ ACL applied in the **inbound direction** on the WAN interface.

Score: **100%**  
Time: **04:56**
