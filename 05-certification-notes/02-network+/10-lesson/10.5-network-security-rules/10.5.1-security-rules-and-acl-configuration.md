## Security Rules and ACL Configuration

### üß± ACL Basics
- **ACL (Access Control List)**: Defines which traffic is allowed or denied across network segments.
- Typically enforced at **firewalls** or routers.
- Supports **filtering** at various layers (IP, port, protocol).
- Built on the **Principle of Least Access**:
  - Only allow traffic necessary for operations.
  - Block everything else.

### üîÉ Rule Processing (Top ‚Üí Bottom)
- ACL rules are processed **top to bottom**.
- **First match wins**: once a match is found, the rest are skipped.
- If no rules match, the firewall applies an:
  - ‚úÖ **Implicit Deny** (default block)
  - üîç Some systems require an **explicit deny all** at the end.

### ‚úèÔ∏è ACL Rule Format (5-Tuple)
Rules can be written to match based on:
- **Protocol**
- **Source IP**
- **Source Port**
- **Destination IP**
- **Destination Port**

Example: allow TCP traffic from 192.168.1.10:1234 to 10.0.0.5:80

### üìã Log-Only Rules
- ACLs can log traffic without blocking/allowing.
- Useful for **testing** new rules.
- Helps with visibility and tuning.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls

#### ‚úÖ Stateful Firewall
- Tracks existing connections using a **state table**.
- Can recognize **return traffic** as part of a legitimate session.
- Example:
  - Allows a web server reply without needing an outbound rule.

#### ‚ùå Stateless Firewall
- Treats each packet in isolation.
- No connection awareness.
- Requires **explicit inbound and outbound rules** for two-way comms.

### üîç Deployment Considerations
- Firewalls can be deployed as:
  - Physical hardware
  - Virtual appliances (cloud)
  - Host-based or inline (Layer 2 bump-in-the-wire)
- ACLs used to filter:
  - **Inbound and outbound** traffic
  - **Routed or switched** traffic depending on firewall type
