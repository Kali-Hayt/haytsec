## 10.4.5 – Extensible Authentication Protocol and IEEE 802.1X

### 🧱 What Is EAP?

**Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** is a **framework** — not a protocol by itself — for implementing multiple authentication methods between a client (supplicant) and an authentication server.

#### 🔐 Used When:
- A user connects to **Wi-Fi** and must authenticate with a network directory server.
- A device plugs into a **switch port** and **must authenticate** before communicating.
- A remote user connects via **VPN** and needs credential validation.

#### 🧠 What It Supports:
- Password-based login
- Smart cards
- **Digital certificates** (most secure)
- EAP can tunnel data securely (e.g., using TLS) to pass sensitive credentials like user passwords or certificates.

### ✅ IEEE 802.1X – Network Access Control

**IEEE 802.1X** defines **Port-Based Network Access Control (PNAC)**.

- Used in: Ethernet switches, wireless access points, VPN gateways
- Implements EAP methods
- Relies on the **AAA model**:  
  - **Authentication**  
  - **Authorization**  
  - **Accounting**

#### 🧱 Components:

- **Supplicant**: the client device (e.g., laptop)
- **Authenticator**: the switch or access point
- **Authentication Server**: typically a **RADIUS** server

### 🔄 How 802.1X + RADIUS Works

1. Client connects to a port (wired or wireless)
2. Switch (authenticator) **challenges** the client
3. Client responds with credentials (via EAP)
4. Switch **forwards** credentials to the **RADIUS server**
5. RADIUS server:
   - Validates credentials
   - Replies with allow/deny
6. Switch opens port **only if authentication passes**

> 📌 The switch does **not store credentials** — the RADIUS server handles that.  
> 🔑 A **shared secret** is configured between switch and RADIUS to verify each other.

### 🩺 NAC and Health Policy

- Basic NAC = authenticate via **certificates or passwords**
- Advanced NAC = enforce **host posture/health checks**:
  - Is the OS authorized?
  - Are patches up to date?
  - Is antivirus or endpoint security active?
  - Secure config validated via **attestation reports**

> ✅ Device must be **trusted + healthy** before joining the network.
