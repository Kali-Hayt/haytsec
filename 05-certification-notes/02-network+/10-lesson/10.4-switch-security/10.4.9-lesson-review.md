# QUESTION 1

**In which scenario is the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) typically used?**

✅ When a user is accessing a wireless network  
❌ When browsing social media platforms  
❌ When a user is downloading a file from the Internet  
❌ When sending an email  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Browsing social media platforms** happens after network access is already granted. EAP is used before that, during authentication.
- ❌ **Downloading a file** involves standard transport protocols like HTTP/S or FTP—not authentication protocols.
- ❌ **Sending an email** involves SMTP, IMAP, or POP3. EAP isn't part of that path—it’s used at the point of *network access*.

🧱 EAP is for pre-authentication—*before* a device is allowed to join the network.

# QUESTION 2

**In the context of IEEE 802.1X, what is the role of a switch configured as a RADIUS client?**

✅ To forward authentication data  
❌ To encrypt network traffic  
❌ To distribute IP addresses  
❌ To manage network storage  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encrypt network traffic** – That’s handled by protocols like IPsec or TLS, not 802.1X or RADIUS clients.
- ❌ **Distribute IP addresses** – DHCP does this. RADIUS and 802.1X aren’t involved in IP assignment.
- ❌ **Manage network storage** – That’s the job of NAS or file servers. Nothing to do with 802.1X.

🧱 In 802.1X:
- The **switch** is the *authenticator* and acts as a **RADIUS client**.
- It forwards credentials from the **supplicant** (user/device) to the **RADIUS server** for validation.

# QUESTION 3

**Which feature is similar to Dynamic ARP Inspection but for IPv6 networks?**

✅ Neighbor Discovery Inspection  
❌ VLAN tagging  
❌ BPDU Guard  
❌ DHCP snooping  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **VLAN tagging** – Deals with traffic separation, not spoofing prevention.
- ❌ **BPDU Guard** – Protects against attacks on Spanning Tree Protocol, not address resolution.
- ❌ **DHCP snooping** – Helps validate DHCP offers, but it’s for both IPv4 and IPv6, not ARP/NDP-specific.

🧱 **Neighbor Discovery Inspection (NDI)** is the IPv6 equivalent of **DAI (Dynamic ARP Inspection)**.  
It prevents spoofed **Neighbor Discovery Protocol** messages, which serve the same role as ARP in IPv6.

# QUESTION 4

**Which of the following can be a use case for the mirror port in port mirroring?**

✅ Acting as a monitoring point  
❌ Providing power over Ethernet (PoE) to devices  
❌ Serving as an additional port for network clients  
❌ Connecting another switch  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Providing PoE** – Has nothing to do with traffic monitoring; that’s a power function, not a data one.
- ❌ **Additional port for clients** – Mirror ports are **not** intended for client communication. They don’t send/receive normal traffic.
- ❌ **Connecting another switch** – Trunk or uplink ports handle that. A mirror port would **flood** traffic and be totally inappropriate.

🧱 Port mirroring = copying traffic from one or more ports to another for analysis  
🎯 Use case: IDS/IPS, Wireshark, packet sniffers.  
On Cisco gear, this is called **SPAN** (Switched Port Analyzer).

# QUESTION 5

**Which of the following is a vulnerability that still exists even with restricted access to physical switch ports and hardware?**

✅ Rogue administrators  
❌ Increased network latency  
❌ Incompatibility with older network protocols  
❌ Overheating of network equipment  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increased latency** – That's a performance concern, not a vulnerability. Usually tied to congestion or poor design.
- ❌ **Protocol incompatibility** – Again, not a security vulnerability; it’s a configuration or compatibility issue.
- ❌ **Overheating** – That’s a hardware reliability problem, not a security issue.

🔍 **Rogue admins** = *Insiders with elevated privileges*.  
Even with locked ports, if someone with admin access goes bad? You’re wide open. This is why least privilege, auditing, and MFA matter.

# QUESTION 6

**What does MAC filtering on a switch allow an administrator to do?**

✅ Define which MAC addresses are permitted to connect to a particular port.  
❌ Monitor the amount of data transmitted by each MAC address.  
❌ Limit the bandwidth usage per MAC address.  
❌ Assign specific IP addresses to MAC addresses.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Monitor data per MAC** – That’s network monitoring or SNMP territory, not MAC filtering.
- ❌ **Limit bandwidth** – You'd need QoS (Quality of Service) features or traffic shaping for that, not filtering.
- ❌ **Assign IPs** – That's DHCP reservation, not handled by the switch’s MAC filtering.

🧱 MAC filtering = Access control based on device identity (hardware address).  
It’s simple, effective, but not foolproof — MACs can be spoofed. Use with other security layers.

# QUESTION 7

**Can port mirroring be configured to filter packets based on specific criteria?**

✅ Yes, packets can be filtered based on multiple criteria.  
❌ Yes, but only by MAC address.  
❌ No, port mirroring copies all traffic without filtering.  
❌ Yes, but only by IP address.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Only MAC** – Some switches support MAC filtering, but it's not the *only* option.
- ❌ **No filtering** – Basic mirroring might copy all traffic, but most modern switches *can* filter.
- ❌ **Only IP** – Filters can go beyond IP: protocol, port, even VLAN in advanced setups.

🧱 Port mirroring (like SPAN on Cisco) can be tailored with filters to avoid overloading the monitoring system. That includes:
- Protocol type (e.g., TCP, ICMP)
- Port numbers (e.g., only capture port 80 traffic)
- Source/destination IP or MAC

It’s like setting a mirror that only reflects specific shapes, not the whole room.

# QUESTION 8

**What does a health policy in NAC solutions typically require from a client?**

✅ An attestation report  
❌ A network performance analysis  
❌ A financial report  
❌ A user activity log  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Network performance analysis** – That's used in QoS, not NAC health checks.
- ❌ **Financial report** – Has no bearing on system/network security posture.
- ❌ **User activity log** – NAC doesn’t care about browsing history; it cares about *device state*.

🧱 **Attestation report** = proof the system meets the security posture:
- Antivirus installed & updated  
- Firewall enabled  
- OS patched  
- No risky processes/services running

It’s like a digital clean bill of health before you're allowed into the secure network.

# QUESTION 9

**What does "protect mode" do when a switch port enters a violation state?**

✅ It drops frames from the invalid source address but keeps the interface open.  
❌ It encrypts traffic from the invalid source address.  
❌ It reroutes traffic from the invalid source address to a quarantine VLAN.  
❌ It disables the port and sends alerts.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encrypts traffic** – Protect mode is about *dropping* unauthorized traffic, not securing it.
- ❌ **Quarantine VLAN** – That’s a separate feature (like in some NAC solutions), not part of standard port security modes.
- ❌ **Disables port and alerts** – That describes **shutdown** mode, not protect mode.

🧱 **Protect mode** is one of the three Cisco port security violation actions:
- `protect`: drops violating frames silently, port stays up  
- `restrict`: drops frames *and* logs/send SNMP trap  
- `shutdown`: brings port down entirely (most severe)

Use **protect** if you want quiet security without disruption.

# QUESTION 10

**What does enabling Root Guard on ports not used as trunk lines accomplish?**

✅ It prevents unauthorized changes to the root bridge selection.  
❌ It allows for faster convergence of the spanning tree.  
❌ It encrypts BPDU packets for secure transmission.  
❌ It increases the number of allowable VLANs on a port.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Faster convergence** – That’s a job for features like **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)**, not Root Guard.
- ❌ **Encrypts BPDU** – BPDUs are not encrypted; Root Guard monitors them but doesn’t secure them.
- ❌ **Increases VLANs** – VLAN limits are managed by hardware/software limits, not Root Guard.

🧱 **Root Guard** ensures that ports **cannot become the root bridge**. If a BPDU is received indicating that port wants to become root, Root Guard disables the port (placing it in *root-inconsistent* state) until the threat disappears.

🛡️ It’s a protection *against rogue switches* attempting to hijack spanning-tree root elections.
