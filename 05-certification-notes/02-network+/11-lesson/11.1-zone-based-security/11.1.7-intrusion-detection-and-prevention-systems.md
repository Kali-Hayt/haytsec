## 11.1.7 – Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

---

### 🛡️ What is IDS?

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** = Passive defense  
Monitors traffic and **raises alerts** when it detects signs of malicious behavior.

#### 🧱 Two Types of Detection:

- **Signature-based** ✅  
  - Looks for known attack patterns (signatures)  
  - Must be updated regularly (like antivirus)

- **Anomaly-based** 🔍  
  - Builds a baseline of “normal” traffic  
  - Flags deviations (risk: false positives)

#### 🔧 Key Traits:
- Passive — **does not block**, only alerts
- Requires a **sniffer** (e.g., mirrored port or TAP)
- Typically placed **behind a firewall** to monitor incoming/outgoing traffic
- Doesn’t have an IP address (stealth mode)

> 📦 Like a security camera — it watches and warns but doesn’t stop the intruder.

### 🛡️ What is IPS?

**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** = Active defense  
Monitors traffic **and takes immediate action** to stop threats.

#### 🧱 Typical Responses:
- Sends TCP RST (reset) to cut off sessions
- Blocks attacker’s IP (shunning)
- Throttles bandwidth to attacker
- Rewrites/filters packets
- Launches custom scripts (if configured)

> 📦 Like a bouncer at the door — sees a threat and **physically throws it out**.

### 🔁 IDS vs IPS Comparison

| Feature         | IDS                           | IPS                            |
|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Behavior        | Passive (detect only)         | Active (detect + respond)      |
| Placement       | Out-of-band (monitors only)   | In-line (sits in traffic path) |
| Response time   | Fast alert                    | Real-time action               |
| Failure impact  | Doesn't affect flow           | Could be a bottleneck          |
| Detection types | Signature & anomaly-based     | Same + automated prevention    |

### 🧠 Deployment Notes

- IPS is often **built into firewalls and proxies**
- Must be fast to avoid **latency/bottlenecks**
- Can become a **single point of failure** unless fault-tolerant
- **Host-based IDS/IPS** (HIDS/HIPS) run as agents on endpoints:
  - Monitor logs, files, processes
  - Catch insider threats or local exploits

---

### 🧠 TL;DR

- **IDS**: Watches, alerts, no direct interference  
- **IPS**: Watches + acts immediately to stop attacks  
- Both critical for **defense in depth**
