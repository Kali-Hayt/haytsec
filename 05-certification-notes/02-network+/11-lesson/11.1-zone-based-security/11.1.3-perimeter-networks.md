## 11.1.3 Perimeter Networks

### 🧱 What Is a Perimeter Network?

- Also known as a **DMZ** (Demilitarized Zone).
- A special network **zone for internet-facing hosts** — servers that communicate with the outside world.
- Its core principle: **no direct traffic should pass from external sources to internal networks**.

> 🧱 Think of it like a **castle moat**: the outer gates (perimeter network) allow limited, controlled entry, but no one can walk straight into the castle (internal network) without serious vetting.

---

### 🧱 Purpose of a Perimeter Network

- Let **external clients** (like web users) access services (web servers, email, etc.) **without compromising internal systems**.
- Prevent attackers from hopping directly from an exposed public system to internal trusted zones.

---

### 🔁 Proxy Communication Example

If a device on the internal network needs to talk to a public web server:
- It doesn’t talk directly.
- Instead, a **proxy in the perimeter zone** handles the request.
  - The proxy validates the request.
  - If valid, it **relays** the message to the web server.
  - To the web server, it looks like the proxy made the request.

> 📬 It's like having a **personal assistant** send letters on your behalf. The recipient only sees your assistant’s name — not yours.

### ✅ What Goes in the Perimeter Network?

- **Public-facing servers** like:
  - Web servers
  - Email servers
  - Proxy servers
  - Remote access/VPN gateways
- These systems are **semi-trusted** — hardened, but still vulnerable due to internet exposure.

> 🔍 Internal networks don’t fully trust perimeter hosts — they're like **neighbors outside the wall**, not family inside the home.

---

### 🧠 Why It Matters

- Perimeter networks **limit damage** if an internet-facing host is compromised.
- They act as a **buffer zone**, shielding the inner network from direct exposure.
- Critical for enforcing **Zero Trust Architecture**: never trust, always verify — even if it's on “your side” of the firewall.
