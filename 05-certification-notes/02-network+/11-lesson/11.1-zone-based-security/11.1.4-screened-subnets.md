## 11.1.4 Screened Subnets

### 🧱 What Is a Screened Subnet?

- A **screened subnet** is a type of perimeter network with **two firewalls**:
  1. One between the **Internet** and the perimeter subnet.
  2. One between the **perimeter subnet** and the **internal LAN**.

> 🧱 Think of it like a medieval fortress with two gates:
> - The **outer gate** screens travelers from the wilds (Internet).
> - The **inner gate** protects the royal chambers (LAN).
> - The courtyard in between is the **perimeter subnet** — public enough for guests, protected enough for safety.

### 🔥 Firewall Roles

- **Screening Firewall** (public-facing):
  - Sits between the Internet and the perimeter zone.
  - Allows **only permitted traffic** into the perimeter.

- **Choke Firewall** (LAN-facing):
  - Sits between the perimeter zone and the internal network.
  - Controls and monitors **any traffic trying to enter the LAN**.
  - This is a **choke point** — a narrow, tightly controlled path ideal for inspection and logging.

### 🔀 Alternative Setup: Triple-Homed Firewall

- Instead of two firewalls, you can use **one device with three interfaces**:
  - **Public interface** (Internet)
  - **Perimeter interface** (DMZ)
  - **LAN interface** (internal)
- With proper **routing and filtering rules**, this setup can replicate a screened subnet.

> 🔍 Analogy: Like a security guard in the middle of a Y-shaped hallway, watching both exits and inspecting every visitor.

### ❗ DMZ = Marketing Term?

- “**Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**” is often used to describe screened subnets or perimeter zones.
- But it's **not technically accurate**:
  - Real DMZs are neutral or shared zones — a perimeter network is **privately managed**.
  - Hosts in the subnet are **still owned, secured, and monitored** by the organization.

> 🧱 So while “DMZ” is popular, **screened subnet** or **perimeter network** is the correct term in professional contexts.

### 🧠 Why Use a Screened Subnet?

- Adds an **extra layer of defense** between public exposure and private assets.
- Ensures **redundant inspection** — if one firewall fails or is bypassed, the second still stands guard.
- Makes **auditing and monitoring easier** by concentrating traffic through known choke points.
