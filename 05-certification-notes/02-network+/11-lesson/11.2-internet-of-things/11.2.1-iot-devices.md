## 11.2.1 IoT Devices

### üß± Embedded Systems
- Complete computer systems built to perform a **specific, dedicated function**.
- Can range from microcontrollers (e.g., in IV drips) to large-scale systems (e.g., water treatment control networks).
- Characterized as **static environments**:
  - ‚ùå No frequent updates or reconfiguration
  - ‚úÖ Easier to protect due to predictability
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: Limited admin visibility and minimal support for updates/fixes

üß† **Analogy**: Think of an embedded system as a one-trick pony ‚Äî excellent at its task, but it won‚Äôt learn new tricks or adapt easily.

---

### ‚úÖ Internet of Things (IoT)
- A **global network of embedded systems**.
- Commonly used in:
  - Personal devices
  - Home appliances
  - Smart vehicles
  - Home automation
- IoT devices contain:
  - Sensors
  - Software
  - Network connectivity
- Enables **M2M (machine-to-machine)** communication and data exchange.

### üè† Consumer-Grade Smart Devices

**Smart homes rely on:**

- **Hub/control systems**
  - Act as communication bridges
  - Most devices are **headless** (no screen/interface)
  - Example: Smart speaker controlled by app or voice

- **Smart devices**
  - Examples: Light bulbs, thermostats, doorbells, fridges
  - Capabilities:
    - Compute
    - Storage
    - Networking
  - OS often based on **Linux or Android**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerable to:
    - Web app attacks
    - Network exploits
    - Peripheral abuse (e.g., compromised cameras, mics)

---

### üè¢ Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) & Smart Buildings

- **PACS**: Networks managing physical security (e.g., locks, alarms, surveillance).
- **BAS (Building Automation Systems)** extend beyond PACS to include:
  - HVAC
  - Fire control
  - Lighting/power systems
  - Elevators/escalators
- Use **PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)** and **sensors** to:
  - Measure: temperature, pressure, humidity, occupancy
  - Monitor & control building infrastructure

üß† **Analogy**: Think of a smart building like a living body ‚Äî sensors are nerves, PLCs are the brain, and HVAC/fire control/power are the organs keeping it alive and running.
