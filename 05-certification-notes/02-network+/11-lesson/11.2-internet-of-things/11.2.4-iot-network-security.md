## 11.2.4 IoT Network Security

### 🧱 IoT Deployment Risks by Type

IoT devices may be:
- Part of dedicated embedded systems
- Deployed within smart building networks
- Installed individually by employees

🧠 Best practice: Segment by category:
1. Consumer-grade devices  
2. Smart building tech  
3. Industrial systems

### 🏠 Consumer-Grade Smart Devices

- Usually connect over **Wi-Fi**
- Common risks:
  - Poor documentation
  - Weak or default credentials
  - Lax vendor patching
  - Minimal configuration effort required to "just work"

- Key security issue: **Shadow IT**
  - Employees bring in devices **without approval**
  - Devices may expose network to threats via:
    - Remote access (e.g., home VPNs)
    - Misconfigurations
    - Insecure home networks

✅ **Mitigations**:
- Regular **audits**
- **Security awareness** training
- Lock down **admin interfaces**
- Assign IoT config responsibilities to specific **roles**
- Include IoT in **patch & vulnerability** management plans

---

### 🏢 Smart Building Systems

- Typically more **controlled** than consumer devices
- Focus areas:
  - Entry systems
  - Lighting
  - Climate controls

✅ Security practices:
- Isolate over **dedicated network segments**
- Use **configuration/change control** procedures
- Track **vendor advisories** to patch known vulnerabilities

🧠 These are low-risk only **if** properly segmented and managed.

---

### ⚙️ ICS / SCADA Systems

- Usually use **dedicated OT networks** or **wireless WAN**
- **Problem**: Sometimes linked to corporate IT networks

💥 Risks:
- **Bridging points** exploited by threat actors
- Attackers pivot from:
  - Data network → embedded systems
  - Embedded network → corporate assets

✅ Mitigations:
- **Isolate** embedded management/monitoring traffic
- If full isolation isn’t possible:
  - Apply **strict access controls**
  - Monitor links continuously

🧠 **Golden Rule**: ICS/SCADA systems should not trust the corporate LAN—and vice versa.
