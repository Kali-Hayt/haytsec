# QUESTION 1

Where are Internet-facing hosts typically placed in network security architecture?

❌ Directly on the public Internet without any security measures  
❌ In the internal network  
❌ In a completely isolated network with no internet access  
✅ In the perimeter network zone

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Public Internet with no security**: That would be a disaster waiting to happen—**zero protection**.
- ❌ **Internal network**: You should **never** expose your internal network directly to the Internet—it's a core security violation.
- ❌ **Completely isolated**: That defeats the point of being *Internet-facing*—it needs some public access.

# QUESTION 2

Which IDS method defines a baseline of normal network traffic and then looks for anything that falls outside of that baseline?

❌ Dictionary recognition  
✅ Anomaly-based  
❌ Misuse detection  
❌ Pattern matching

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Dictionary recognition**: That’s used in **password cracking**, not IDS.
- ❌ **Misuse detection**: Looks for **known attack signatures**, not deviations from normal.
- ❌ **Pattern matching**: Another name for **signature-based detection**, which requires known patterns—not baselines.

# QUESTION 3

What is the purpose of a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) in an ICS?

❌ To provide physical security for industrial sites  
❌ To manage employee schedules and tasks  
✅ To enable user interaction with the PLCs  
❌ To serve as the primary data storage solution

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Physical security**: That’s the job of access controls, cameras, guards—not HMIs.
- ❌ **Employee schedules**: That’s an **HR or ERP system** task, not ICS/HMI-related.
- ❌ **Primary data storage**: HMIs don’t function as storage—they **display and control** system operations.

# QUESTION 4

You want to use CCTV as a preventative security measure.  
Which of the following is a requirement for your plan?

❌ Low LUX or infrared camera  
❌ Sufficient lighting  
✅ Security guards  
❌ PTZ camera

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Low LUX/infrared**: Useful for night vision, but alone they **don’t make a system preventative**—someone must respond to what they show.
- ❌ **Sufficient lighting**: Lighting helps image quality but isn’t enough to make CCTV *preventative* without **human response**.
- ✅ **Security guards**: A **preventative** CCTV setup requires someone actively **monitoring and acting** on footage—usually a guard or operator.
- ❌ **PTZ camera**: Adds flexibility but still needs someone to **control and interpret** the view to make it preventative.

# QUESTION 5

Which of the following network security zones is subject to strict hardening and configuration management policies, and where hosts, user accounts, and traffic are continually monitored to ensure compliance with security policies?

✅ Private server administrative networks  
❌ Public server network  
❌ Guest  
❌ Private client network

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Public server network**: Focuses on **external access**, not deep policy enforcement or internal control.
- ❌ **Guest**: By design, guest networks are **loosely restricted** and isolated—not strictly monitored.
- ❌ **Private client network**: Used for internal employee access, but doesn’t reach the **sensitivity level** of administrative servers.

# QUESTION 6

What is a major risk associated with the placement of consumer-grade smart devices in a corporate workspace?

❌ Improved device interoperability  
✅ Shadow IT  
❌ Increased productivity  
❌ Enhanced security

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Improved interoperability**: Not guaranteed—consumer devices often **lack enterprise compatibility**.
- ❌ **Increased productivity**: Maybe, but not without **risk trade-offs**—and not the major concern.
- ❌ **Enhanced security**: Quite the opposite—consumer devices are **less hardened** and rarely meet corporate policy standards.

---
# QUESTION 7

What is a Distributed Control System (DCS) usually referred to as?

❌ A global internet service provider  
✅ A single-site process automation system  
❌ A personal computing network  
❌ A multi-site supervisory system

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Global ISP**: Has nothing to do with industrial control systems—completely unrelated.
- ❌ **Personal computing network**: DCS operates in **industrial** environments, not for personal use.
- ❌ **Multi-site supervisory system**: That's closer to a **SCADA system**, which handles **multiple sites**.

---
# QUESTION 8

Why should all IoT devices be included in patch and vulnerability management audits?

❌ To ensure they are using the latest software versions  
❌ To evaluate their environmental impact  
❌ To assess their performance efficiency  
✅ To identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Latest software**: That’s important, but the **core goal** is **vulnerability mitigation**, not just version control.
- ❌ **Environmental impact**: Irrelevant to patching or vulnerability management.
- ❌ **Performance efficiency**: That's a **system optimization** concern, not a **security audit** focus.

---
# QUESTION 9

What is the primary benefit of using a CCTV?

❌ Increases security protection throughout an environment  
❌ Provides a corrective control  
✅ Expands the area visible to security guards  
❌ Reduces the need for locks and sensors on doors

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increases security protection**: Not directly—CCTV is **detective**, not a hard **preventive** measure.
- ❌ **Corrective control**: CCTV is a **detective control**, not corrective (which fixes after damage is done).
- ❌ **Reduces need for locks/sensors**: Nope—**CCTV supplements**, not replaces, physical access controls.

# QUESTION 10

What is geofencing?

❌ A physical barrier installed around a property to enhance security  
✅ A practice of creating a virtual boundary based on real-world geography  
❌ A type of software that creates geographical coordinates  
❌ A method of encrypting data using geographical coordinates

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Physical barrier**: That’s just fencing—not “geo” fencing. Geofencing is virtual, not tangible.
- ❌ **Software for coordinates**: Geofencing uses coordinates, but doesn’t **generate** them—it defines zones based on them.
- ❌ **Encryption method**: Has nothing to do with data encryption—purely about **location-based policy enforcement**.

# QUESTION 11

You are tasked with enhancing the security of a corporate office building. The building currently uses traditional key locks for all entry points. You are considering upgrading to a more secure and efficient system.

Which of the following options would BEST meet the need for both security and efficiency?

❌ Adding additional traditional key locks to each door  
❌ Installing high-strength padlocks on all doors  
❌ Placing motion sensors at all entry points  
✅ Implementing a badge reader system

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Additional locks/padlocks**: More cumbersome, not scalable, and harder to manage—zero efficiency.
- ❌ **Motion sensors**: Helpful for **detection**, not for controlling access or **authentication**.
- ✅ **Badge readers**: Offer **controlled, auditable, and scalable** access with speed and flexibility.

# QUESTION 12

An administrator received an alert regarding suspicious activity on the network. The system is logging the activity and the administrator must determine how to handle the situation.

What kind of system most likely sent the alert?

✅ IDS  
❌ NAC  
❌ Firewall  
❌ IPS

Why the others are wrong:
- ✅ **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Perfect fit—**monitors**, **logs**, and **alerts** without taking direct action.
- ❌ **NAC (Network Access Control)**: Controls device access based on policies—it doesn't **monitor** or **alert** on traffic behavior.
- ❌ **Firewall**: Controls traffic flow; it may **block**, but **doesn't typically alert** on suspicious patterns alone.
- ❌ **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Actively blocks and prevents threats—**doesn’t just alert and leave it to admins**.

---
# QUESTION 13

What is a key security measure for managing smart building systems?

❌ Using default configurations for ease of use  
✅ Isolating network segments for management and monitoring  
❌ Performing management and monitoring over public networks  
❌ Avoiding configuration management and change control processes

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Default configs**: These are a major **security risk**—often publicly known and easily exploited.
- ✅ **Network isolation**: Prevents cross-contamination from general IT traffic; ideal for **OT (Operational Tech)** systems like smart buildings.
- ❌ **Public networks**: Insecure and **exposes critical systems** to interception and attack.
- ❌ **Avoiding config/change control**: That’s a straight-up **violation of best practices**—high risk of error and exploitation.

# QUESTION 14

Which systems can location services use to determine a device's current position for geofencing?

❌ IPS and NFC  
✅ GPS and IPS  
❌ GPS and RFID  
❌ RFID and NFC

Why the others are wrong:
- ✅ **GPS and IPS**: These are the **two primary systems** used for outdoor and indoor positioning.
- ❌ **IPS and NFC**: NFC is for **short-range communication**, not positioning.
- ❌ **GPS and RFID**: RFID is passive and not typically used for **device geolocation**.
- ❌ **RFID and NFC**: Neither provides accurate **location tracking** over any real distance.

# QUESTION 15

You are concerned about protecting your network from network-based attacks on the Internet. Specifically, you are concerned about attacks that have not yet been identified or that do not have prescribed protections.

Which type of device should you use?

❌ Antivirus scanner  
❌ Signature-based IDS  
❌ Host-based firewall  
❌ Network-based firewall  
✅ Anomaly-based IDS

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Antivirus scanner**: Detects **known malware**—not effective against unknown, evolving network threats.
- ❌ **Signature-based IDS**: Relies on **known attack patterns**—useless against zero-day or unknown exploits.
- ❌ **Host/Network firewalls**: Block/allow traffic based on rules, but don’t detect or learn from **unusual behavior**.
- ✅ **Anomaly-based IDS**: Learns what “normal” looks like and raises alerts on **suspicious deviations**, making it ideal for **unknown threats**.
