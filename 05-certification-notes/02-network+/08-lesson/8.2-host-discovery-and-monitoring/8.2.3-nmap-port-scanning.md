## 8.2.3 Nmap Port Scanning  
#networking-plus

- A **port scanner** identifies which **TCP or UDP ports** are open/listening on a system.
- This helps with:
  - 🔍 Service detection  
  - 🔍 Host detection  
  - 🔍 OS & software fingerprinting

### 🧱 Port Scanning Techniques in Nmap

- **TCP SYN (`-sS`)**
  - Fast, **half-open scan** (doesn't complete the TCP handshake)
  - Sends SYN, watches for SYN-ACK → identifies open ports
  - ✅ Stealthier than full connect

- **TCP Connect (`-sT`)**
  - Attempts **full TCP handshake**
  - Less stealthy, requires OS-level connect if raw packet privileges are unavailable

- **UDP Scan (`-sU`)**
  - Probes **UDP ports**, waits for a reply or ICMP "port unreachable"
  - Slower: no ACKs, often used with `-sS` for a complete picture

- **Port Range (`-p`)**
  - By default: scans top 1,000 most common ports  
  - Specify exact ports: `-p 22,80,443`  
  - Or use: `--top-ports n` to scan *n* most common ports  
  - 📊 Port usage stats come from `nmap-services` config

### 🔍 Fingerprinting Services

- After detecting services, use:
  - `-sV`: Discover service **version**
  - `-A`: **Aggressive scan** (includes OS detection, versioning, script scan, traceroute)
- This process of identifying apps or OS via their responses = **fingerprinting**
