## 8.2.5 Performance Monitoring  
#networking-plus

### 🧠 Purpose of Monitoring
- Network monitoring tools do more than just **host/service discovery**.
- They can:
  - Capture/analyze traffic  
  - Monitor interface & device metrics  
  - Consolidate log data  
  - Alert on events, define baselines  
  - Identify traffic patterns/congestion  
  - Plan upgrades and generate reports

### 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Bandwidth**
  - Rated speed of interfaces (e.g., 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps)
  - More stable on wired Ethernet; WAN/WLAN may vary

- **Utilization / Throughput**
  - Utilization: % of bandwidth in use  
  - Throughput: amount of data transferred per time unit

- **CPU and Memory**
  - High CPU or memory use = may need upgrades  
  - May indicate traffic bottlenecks or insufficient resources

- **Storage**
  - Used for logs, config files, etc.  
  - Measured in MB/GB  
  - Low storage can lead to errors or dropped logs  
  - Fast I/O = critical for servers

### 🔁 Baseline Metrics

- **Baseline metrics** = resource use snapshot at a point in time (e.g., after install)
- Helps compare future performance against **normal operation**
- Example: Bandwidth usage before/after office expansion

#### 🛠️ Baseline review:
- Decide if the current baseline still reflects expected usage  
- If the system or traffic changes, take a new baseline
