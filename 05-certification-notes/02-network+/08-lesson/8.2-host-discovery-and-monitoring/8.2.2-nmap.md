## 8.2.2 Nmap  
- **Nmap (Network Mapper)** is a widely used **IP scanning** tool, helpful for:
  - ✅ Auditing networks  
  - ✅ Penetration testing

- It's **open-source** and available on:
  - Windows  
  - Linux  
  - macOS  
  - 🧱 Can be used via CLI or GUI (Zenmap)

### 🧱 Basic Syntax
- Nmap typically requires an **IP subnet** or specific **IP address** to scan.
- Default behavior:
  - Pings the host
  - Sends **TCP ACK packets** to ports **80 and 443** to check if host is alive

### 🔍 On Local Networks:
- Performs **ARP** and **ND (Neighbor Discovery)** sweeps  
- If a host responds:
  - Nmap does a **port scan** to identify active services  
  - May attempt **OS fingerprinting** (can be slow on big subnets)

### 🛠️ Useful Switches:
- `-sn`: **Suppresses port scanning**, only does host discovery  
- `--traceroute`: Reveals **hop counts** to each host (like `traceroute`)
