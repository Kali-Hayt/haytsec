# QUESTION 1

What functionality is often integrated into enterprise network management suites to help manage the network's logical topology?

✅ IP Address Management (IPAM)  
❌ Video editing capabilities  
❌ Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  
❌ Social media analytics  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Video editing capabilities** – Has nothing to do with network topology; irrelevant in a network context.  
- ❌ **CRM** – Manages customer relationships, not networking infrastructure.  
- ❌ **Social media analytics** – Used for marketing and engagement metrics, not network architecture.  

🧱 **IPAM** helps track IP addresses, subnet allocations, and DHCP/DNS integration—critical for managing logical layouts.

# QUESTION 2

You have been using SNMP on your network for monitoring and management, but you're concerned about the security of this configuration.  
What should you do to increase security in this situation?

❌ Combine SNMP with SSL.  
❌ Use SSH instead of SNMP.  
❌ Implement a RADIUS solution.  
✅ Implement version 3 of SNMP.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Combine SNMP with SSL** – SNMP doesn't natively support SSL. That's not how SNMP is secured.  
- ❌ **Use SSH instead of SNMP** – SSH is for remote access, not network monitoring or device polling.  
- ❌ **Implement a RADIUS solution** – RADIUS handles authentication, not SNMP security specifically.  

✅ **SNMPv3** adds authentication and encryption, solving SNMP's major security flaws. That's your go-to upgrade for hardening.

# QUESTION 3

What can cause a network bottleneck?

❌ A well-optimized network  
❌ A low number of network users  
❌ A high-quality video streaming  
✅ An underpowered or faulty device  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A well-optimized network** should *prevent* bottlenecks, not cause them.
- ❌ **A low number of users** usually *reduces* traffic, which makes bottlenecks less likely.
- ❌ **High-quality video streaming** does use bandwidth, but on its own it typically doesn’t cause a bottleneck unless the network is already weak or misconfigured. The key word in the question is “cause”—this answer assumes the infrastructure is already capable.

🧱 A **faulty switch, router, or NIC** with bad firmware or weak CPU/RAM can choke performance—even with low usage or basic traffic.

# QUESTION 4

How can the detail of the information shown about each frame be increased in tcpdump?

❌ Using the **-w** switch  
✅ Using the **-v, -vv, or -vvv** switches  
❌ Using the **-e** switch  
❌ Using the **-i** switch  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **-w** – Writes raw packets to a file (like `tcpdump -w capture.pcap`); doesn’t affect display detail.
- ❌ **-e** – Shows link-level headers (like MAC addresses), not general verbosity.
- ❌ **-i** – Selects which interface to capture from (e.g., `-i eth0`), not verbosity level.

✅ **-v, -vv, -vvv** – Increase verbosity. `-v` adds extra detail, `-vv` adds more, and `-vvv` goes deepest into protocols. Useful for deep inspection of DNS, HTTP, etc.

---
# QUESTION 5

What is one of the features that log analysis and reporting software should have?

✅ The capability to identify trends in the data  
❌ The function to replace network monitoring tools  
❌ The option to manually enter log data  
❌ The ability to increase network bandwidth  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Replace network monitoring tools** – Log analysis complements monitoring; it doesn't replace tools like SNMP agents, flow collectors, or real-time alerts.
- ❌ **Manually enter log data** – Logs should come from automated sources (devices/services); manual entry defeats the purpose and risks inaccuracy.
- ❌ **Increase network bandwidth** – Software can't increase physical network bandwidth; that's a hardware or ISP matter.

✅ Trend analysis is key — spotting spikes, anomalies, or long-term issues is what makes log tools valuable.

---
# QUESTION 6

What is the primary function of a protocol analyzer in network support?

✅ To inspect traffic received by a host  
❌ To manage network resources  
❌ To encrypt network traffic  
❌ To increase network speed  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Manage network resources** – That’s the job of a network management system (NMS), not a protocol analyzer.
- ❌ **Encrypt network traffic** – Protocol analyzers **read** traffic; encryption is handled by security protocols like TLS or IPSec.
- ❌ **Increase network speed** – Analyzers don't boost performance; they help diagnose what's **slowing things down**.

✅ A protocol analyzer (like Wireshark) captures and dissects traffic at the packet level, showing headers, payloads, and flags — essential for troubleshooting.

---
# QUESTION 7

What is the primary purpose of using traffic analysis tools in network performance testing?

✅ To simulate traffic loads and observe performance  
❌ To enhance the graphical interface of network applications  
❌ To physically inspect network cables  
❌ To increase the network's data rate  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Enhance graphical interfaces** – That's a **UI/UX design** task, not something traffic analysis tools do.
- ❌ **Physically inspect network cables** – That’s a **manual hardware task**; traffic analyzers work in software.
- ❌ **Increase data rate** – Analyzers **don’t boost performance**, they measure it.

✅ Traffic analysis tools stress-test the network by simulating real-world load, revealing how it performs under pressure — essential for proactive tuning.

---
# QUESTION 8

What is the recommended practice when using SNMP v2c regarding community strings?

✅ Use difficult to guess community strings.  
❌ Use SNMP v2c for secure environments only.  
❌ Transmit them in plaintext over the network.  
❌ Leave the community string set to the default.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Use SNMP v2c for secure environments only** – SNMP v2c lacks encryption and authentication; it's not ideal for secure environments at all.
- ❌ **Transmit them in plaintext** – That’s **exactly what v2c does**, but it’s *not* recommended. It's a **security risk**.
- ❌ **Leave the default** – The default community string is usually **“public”** – extremely insecure and well-known.

✅ **Strong, non-default community strings** are one of the few protections available when stuck using SNMP v2c. But if possible, upgrade to SNMPv3 for encryption and authentication.

---
# QUESTION 9

Which Boolean operators can be used to combine filter expressions in `tcpdump`?

✅ and, or, not  
❌ true, false, maybe  
❌ add, subtract, multiply  
❌ equal, less than, greater than  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **true, false, maybe** – Sounds philosophical, not practical. `tcpdump` doesn’t use these.
- ❌ **add, subtract, multiply** – Math operators, not Boolean logic.
- ❌ **equal, less than, greater than** – These are comparison operators, not Boolean connectors for expressions in `tcpdump`.

✅ **`tcpdump` uses logical Boolean operators `and`, `or`, and `not`** to combine expressions like:
```bash
tcpdump tcp and port 80
tcpdump not host 10.0.0.1
```
---

# QUESTION 10

What is the primary purpose of prioritizing events in a logging system?

✅ To categorize events based on their severity  
❌ To reduce the storage space required for logging  
❌ To ensure all events are recorded at the same level of detail  
❌ To increase the number of events that can be generated per hour  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To reduce the storage space required for logging** – Prioritization may *incidentally* reduce storage, but that’s not the goal. It’s about urgency, not compression.
- ❌ **To ensure all events are recorded at the same level of detail** – The point of prioritization is to do the *opposite*—focus more on critical events.
- ❌ **To increase the number of events that can be generated per hour** – Logging isn't about spamming more events; it’s about clarity, relevance, and triage.

✅ **Prioritizing lets systems and admins focus on what matters most**, like distinguishing between a critical intrusion alert and a routine login.

---
# QUESTION 11

Which open-source tool is mentioned as a graphical packet capture and analysis utility?

❌ Netcat  
❌ Nessus  
✅ Wireshark  
❌ Nmap  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Netcat** – Great for raw TCP/UDP communication and testing, but it's CLI-based and not made for graphical packet analysis.
- ❌ **Nessus** – A vulnerability scanner, not a packet sniffer or capture tool.
- ❌ **Nmap** – Known for port scanning and network mapping. It's command-line based and doesn’t capture packets in a graphical interface.

✅ **Wireshark** – This is the industry standard for graphical packet capture and deep protocol analysis. If it goes over the wire, Wireshark sees it.

---
# QUESTION 12

Which of the following is NOT a primary function of a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?

❌ Defining the scope of a service.  
❌ Setting performance characteristics.  
✅ Outlining annual company events.  
❌ Agreeing upon responsibilities between the service provider and the customer.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Defining the scope of a service** – SLAs outline what is being delivered, how, and to what extent.
- ❌ **Setting performance characteristics** – SLAs specify uptime, response times, and performance benchmarks.
- ❌ **Agreeing upon responsibilities** – A core SLA function: who does what, and under what terms.

✅ **Outlining annual company events** – That’s HR or corporate communications, not a service-level concern. SLAs don’t care about your holiday party schedule.

---
# QUESTION 13

What does an availability monitor check for in an HTTP service to confirm availability?

❌ A 302 status code  
✅ A 200 status code  
❌ A 404 status code  
❌ A 500 status code  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **302 status code** – This means a temporary redirect, not an indication that the service is available and functioning correctly.
- ❌ **404 status code** – Classic “Not Found.” The page is MIA—definitely not a sign of healthy service.
- ❌ **500 status code** – Internal Server Error. Something broke. Not available.

✅ **200 status code** – The gold standard of availability: “OK.” Server received, understood, and responded successfully.

---
# QUESTION 14

What standard is used for wiring Ethernet cables?

❌ VGA  
✅ T568A or T568B  
❌ USB  
❌ HDMI  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **VGA** – Video Graphics Array is for analog video signals, not networking.
- ❌ **USB** – Universal Serial Bus is used for peripherals and data transfer, not for Ethernet cable wiring.
- ❌ **HDMI** – High-Definition Multimedia Interface is for audio/video signals, not networking.

✅ **T568A or T568B** – These are the wiring standards for terminating twisted-pair Ethernet cables (like Cat5e/Cat6) into RJ-45 connectors. Pick one and stick with it unless you’re making a crossover cable.

---
# QUESTION 15

Which of the following is NOT information that CDP can report?

❌ Power over Ethernet usage  
✅ MAC address table sizes  
❌ IOS version  
❌ Device ID/hostname  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Power over Ethernet usage** – CDP can report PoE details if the device supports it.
- ❌ **IOS version** – CDP shares software version info, like the Cisco IOS version.
- ❌ **Device ID/hostname** – CDP includes hostname (Device ID) to identify neighboring Cisco devices.

✅ **MAC address table sizes** – CDP does *not* provide internal switch table metrics like MAC address table size. That info comes from switch management commands, not CDP.

---
# QUESTION 16

What can traffic analysis with a protocol analyzer help identify?

✅ Bandwidth consumed by each protocol or host  
❌ The brand of network devices used  
❌ The password of network users  
❌ The physical location of network devices  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The brand of network devices used** – A protocol analyzer captures traffic, not hardware inventory or vendor metadata.
- ❌ **The password of network users** – Passwords may appear in plaintext only if encryption isn't used, but analyzers don’t directly “identify” them.
- ❌ **The physical location of network devices** – Packet analysis doesn’t reveal physical geography. You’d need topology mapping tools or LLDP/CDP for that.

✅ **Bandwidth consumed by each protocol or host** – This is a core strength of protocol analyzers like Wireshark. They show who’s talking, what protocols are used, and how much data is being sent/received.

---
# QUESTION 17

Why are complex applications likely to write to multiple log files?

✅ To separate different types of events  
❌ To increase the storage used by logs  
❌ To confuse potential hackers  
❌ To ensure data redundancy  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To increase the storage used by logs** – No one writes extra logs just to burn space. That’s wasteful and unintentional.
- ❌ **To confuse potential hackers** – That’s not the goal of logging. Security through obscurity isn't a reliable defense strategy.
- ❌ **To ensure data redundancy** – That’s a job for backups or replication systems, not log file structure.

✅ **To separate different types of events** – Applications typically log events by category (e.g., errors, authentication, transactions) to improve clarity, performance, and debugging efficiency.

---
# QUESTION 18

A network administrator is installing hundreds of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices at a corporate facility.  
... administrator requires a centralized remote management framework that can perform regular device polling ... configurable thresholds ... notifications ...

Which of the following is an agent-based framework the administrator can BEST fulfill these monitoring and remote management requirements?

✅ Simple Network Management Protocol  
❌ Remote Desktop Protocol  
❌ Telnet  
❌ Secure Shell  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** – This is for GUI-based remote desktop sessions, not scalable for monitoring many devices or sensors.
- ❌ **Telnet** – Lacks encryption and agent-based architecture. Obsolete and insecure for enterprise-grade IoT management.
- ❌ **Secure Shell (SSH)** – Great for secure command-line access, but doesn't support polling, traps, or automated monitoring out-of-the-box.

✅ **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** – Designed exactly for this use case. It’s agent-based, supports polling, traps (alerts), and scalable monitoring of large sets of devices. Ideal for centralized management of hundreds of IoT sensors.

---
# QUESTION 19

What is the primary purpose of a port scan using tools like Nmap?

❌ To increase network traffic  
❌ To encrypt data packets  
❌ To reset network devices  
✅ To identify which ports are listening  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To increase network traffic** – Port scans generate some traffic, but the goal isn’t to flood or amplify traffic. That’s more aligned with DoS, not scanning.
- ❌ **To encrypt data packets** – Port scanners don’t deal with encryption of data; that’s handled by protocols like TLS, not Nmap.
- ❌ **To reset network devices** – Port scanning doesn’t reset anything. It queries and reports open, closed, or filtered ports.

✅ **To identify which ports are listening** – This is exactly what Nmap does: it checks which TCP or UDP ports are open on a target system, which helps map out running services and potential attack surfaces.

---
# QUESTION 20

What is a cable map?

✅ A floor plan showing how wires are routed through conduit from telecommunications closets to work areas  
❌ A diagram showing the software dependencies between applications  
❌ A graphical representation of Wi-Fi signal strength across an office  
❌ A list of all cables and their specifications  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A diagram showing software dependencies** – That’s a software dependency map or application topology, not a cable map.
- ❌ **Wi-Fi signal strength map** – That’s typically a *heatmap* used in wireless site surveys.
- ❌ **A list of all cables and their specifications** – That’s more of an inventory sheet or cable specification document, not a physical layout.

✅ **A floor plan with conduit and wiring routes** – That’s exactly what a cable map is. It visually shows how network cables are physically laid out, often including junction boxes, IDF closets, MDFs, and patch panel routes.

---
# QUESTION 21

Which of the following is NOT a function commonly divided into three planes in terms of QoS?

❌ Data plane  
❌ Management plane  
✅ Application plane  
❌ Control plane  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Data plane** – Handles the actual forwarding of traffic. It's a core plane in QoS and network function division.
- ❌ **Management plane** – Manages device configuration, monitoring, and remote access. It’s standard in modern QoS-aware architecture.
- ❌ **Control plane** – Makes decisions about routing and traffic paths. Essential to QoS (e.g., routing protocols, ACLs).

✅ **Application plane** – This is *not* one of the traditional planes. While applications may benefit from QoS, they're not a categorized *plane* in network design. The standard planes are **Data**, **Control**, and **Management**.

---
# QUESTION 22

What port does SNMP use for device queries?

✅ UDP port 161  
❌ UDP port 162  
❌ TCP port 443  
❌ TCP port 80  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **UDP port 162** – Used for receiving SNMP traps (notifications), not for sending queries.
- ❌ **TCP port 443** – HTTPS, used for secure web browsing, not SNMP.
- ❌ **TCP port 80** – HTTP, standard for unencrypted web traffic, unrelated to SNMP.

✅ **UDP port 161** – This is the correct port used by SNMP managers to send queries to SNMP agents.

---
# QUESTION 23

A small software development company has recently moved to a new office. The IT manager is tasked with setting up the network infrastructure. The company relies heavily on cloud-based services for development and collaboration, and there's a need to ensure that these services have reliable connectivity.

Additionally, the company plans to use VoIP for all internal and external communications.

Considering the need for both reliable cloud service connectivity and high-quality VoIP calls, which of the following should the IT manager prioritize when configuring the network?

❌ Setting up a VLAN for guest Wi-Fi access.  
❌ Enforcing strict access controls on all network devices.  
✅ Implementing DiffServ for traffic classification and prioritization.  
❌ Purchasing the highest bandwidth internet connection available.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Setting up a VLAN for guest Wi-Fi access** – Good for segmentation, but not related to prioritizing business-critical traffic like VoIP or cloud services.
- ❌ **Enforcing strict access controls** – Important for security, but doesn’t directly improve reliability or quality of service for VoIP/cloud traffic.
- ❌ **Purchasing the highest bandwidth** – Sounds appealing, but without prioritization, bandwidth alone doesn’t guarantee performance for VoIP or time-sensitive traffic.

✅ **Implementing DiffServ** – **Differentiated Services (DiffServ)** is a Layer 3 QoS method that **classifies and prioritizes traffic**. VoIP traffic can be tagged with high priority, while cloud services can get reliable bandwidth. Perfect fit for the scenario.

# QUESTION 24

What is a major benefit of using log collectors and SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management systems) in log analysis?

❌ They guarantee 100% prevention of security breaches.  
✅ They can plot metrics in a graph for better visualization.  
❌ They eliminate the need for manual log reviews.  
❌ They can automatically adjust network settings based on log data.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **They guarantee 100% prevention of security breaches** – No tool can guarantee *100%* prevention. SIEMs help with detection and response, not full-proof protection.
- ❌ **They eliminate the need for manual log reviews** – SIEMs *reduce* manual effort with correlation and alerts, but **humans still need to review** and verify incidents.
- ❌ **They can automatically adjust network settings** – That's automation or orchestration. SIEMs might trigger alerts or tickets, but they don’t directly tweak network configs unless tied into SOAR platforms.

✅ **They can plot metrics in a graph for better visualization** – One of the **core strengths** of SIEMs is their ability to **aggregate, correlate, and visualize** data. Dashboards, graphs, and timelines help analysts quickly spot trends, anomalies, and threats.

---
# QUESTION 25

What does a configuration monitor do when there is a change to a device's production configuration?

✅ It generates logs, alerts, or alarms.  
❌ It automatically reverts the change.  
❌ It disconnects the device from the network.  
❌ It updates the baseline configuration.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It automatically reverts the change** – That would be part of an enforcement or rollback system, not monitoring. Monitoring tools **observe** and **report**, not undo.
- ❌ **It disconnects the device from the network** – That's an extreme response and not the job of a config monitor. Only **access control systems** or NAC might isolate devices.
- ❌ **It updates the baseline configuration** – Baselines are set **manually** or by policy. A monitor won’t overwrite baselines without human or automated decision logic.

✅ **It generates logs, alerts, or alarms** – That’s the textbook job of a configuration monitor. It **detects changes** and **notifies** administrators so they can act. Think of it like a fire alarm—it doesn’t put out the fire, but it tells you there’s smoke.

---
# QUESTION 26

What do "top talkers" and "top listeners" refer to in network analysis?

❌ Top talkers are devices with the highest error rates in the network, while top listeners are devices with the highest packet loss rates.  
❌ Top talkers are the most secure connections in a network, and top listeners are the least secure connections.  
❌ Top talkers are the fastest network connections, while top listeners are the slowest network connections.  
✅ Top talkers are interfaces generating the most outgoing traffic, while top listeners are the interfaces receiving the most incoming traffic.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Error rates and packet loss** — That’s about *network quality*, not the *volume* of communication. “Top talker” means high bandwidth usage, not poor connection health.
- ❌ **Security connection levels** — Has nothing to do with being a "talker" or "listener." Those are performance metrics, not security roles.
- ❌ **Fastest vs. slowest connections** — Speed ≠ amount of traffic. A fast interface could be idle; a slower one might be transferring huge volumes nonstop.

✅ **Top talkers/listeners measure traffic volume** — Think of them as chatterboxes and radio towers. Top talkers blast out data. Top listeners soak it all in.

---
# QUESTION 27

What does log aggregation in the context of SIEM refer to?

❌ The physical collection of log files from different devices  
✅ Normalizing data from different sources to make it consistent  
❌ Encrypting log files for secure storage  
❌ The process of deleting outdated log files to free up storage space  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Physical collection** is more accurately called log collection, not aggregation. Aggregation implies *combining and normalizing*.
- ❌ **Encryption** is about securing logs, not aggregating them.
- ❌ **Deleting outdated logs** is log rotation or retention policy—not aggregation.

🧱 **Log aggregation** is like gathering documents from different departments, then **reformatting them into a standard report template**. Only then can you run analytics across the whole company. That’s what SIEMs need: normalized, consistent data — not a jumble of mismatched formats.


---
# QUESTION 28

Why is it important to label structured cables and patch cords at both ends?

✅ To identify the circuit for troubleshooting unauthorized changes  
❌ To ensure cables are aesthetically pleasing  
❌ To prevent electrical interference  
❌ To increase the speed of the network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Aesthetic labeling** may look nice, but that’s not the real purpose—structured cabling is about function, not fashion.
- ❌ **Labeling doesn’t affect EMI (electromagnetic interference)**. Shielding and separation do that.
- ❌ **Cable labels do not affect network speed**. Speed comes from bandwidth, NICs, and switches—not what’s written on the tag.

🧱 Proper labeling is part of good cable management and essential for rapid, accurate **troubleshooting** and **change control**. When you trace both ends, you can quickly identify:
- Which port it connects to  
- What device or floor it serves  
- Whether someone made an unauthorized move or swap 🔍

# QUESTION 29

Because of an unexplained slowdown on your network, you decide to install monitoring software on several key network hosts to locate the problem. You will then collect and analyze the data from a central network host.  
Which protocol will the software use to detect the problem?

✅ SNMP  
❌ TCP/IP  
❌ UDP  
❌ IPX  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **TCP/IP** is a foundational protocol *suite*, not a monitoring tool. It's the vehicle, not the mechanic.
- ❌ **UDP** is a transport protocol, not designed for diagnostics or monitoring.
- ❌ **IPX** (Internetwork Packet Exchange) is a dead Novell protocol—long obsolete in modern networks.

🧱 **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** is the *go-to protocol* for monitoring and managing networked devices:
- Collects data on performance, uptime, errors, bandwidth  
- Can trigger alerts via traps  
- Operates via polling or event-driven messaging  

It's the protocol that gives your monitoring software visibility into network device status—like asking routers and switches, “Hey, how you feeling?”

# QUESTION 30

What is recommended to avoid when making network schematics?

❌ Using representative icons  
✅ Representing too much in a single diagram  
❌ Creating separate diagrams for different layers  
❌ Including a legend for color schemes  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Using representative icons** is *recommended* because it improves clarity and quick recognition of components.
- ❌ **Creating separate diagrams for different layers** (like logical vs physical) is a best practice. It avoids clutter and supports layered analysis.
- ❌ **Including a legend** is crucial for making the schematic readable—especially for newcomers or stakeholders.

🧱 **Too much in one diagram = visual overload.**  
Imagine putting every server, cable, protocol, VLAN, subnet, and security policy in one view—it’s chaos. Break it down by function or layer for clarity.
