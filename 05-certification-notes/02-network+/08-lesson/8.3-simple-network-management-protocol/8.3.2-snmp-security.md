## 8.3.2 SNMP Security

Many networks still use **SNMP v2c**, which lacks support for strong authentication or encryption.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SNMP v2c Security Guidelines:
- **Community strings** are sent in plaintext ‚Äî avoid using them over insecure networks.
- Use **complex, hard-to-guess** community strings. Never leave them blank or set to default.
- Apply **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** to limit management operations to specific IPs (e.g., one or two trusted hosts).

## üîê SNMP v3 ‚Äî Improved Security

SNMP v3 introduces:
- **Encryption**
- **User-based authentication**

Instead of community strings:
- Agents are configured with **usernames and access permissions**.
- SNMP messages are **signed with a hash of the user's passphrase**.
- The agent uses this hash to verify and authenticate the user.

### üîë SNMP v3 Security Modes:

| Mode         | Description                                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `authNoPriv` | Authenticates messages, but does **not encrypt** the data. |
| `authPriv`   | Authenticates and **encrypts** SNMP messages.              |

‚úÖ **Use SNMP v3** whenever possible to secure monitoring systems.
