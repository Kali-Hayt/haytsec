# QUESTION 1

What is the role of a packet sniffer in the context of a protocol analyzer?

❌ To provide encryption for data packets  
✅ To capture frames moving over the network medium  
❌ To physically connect different network segments  
❌ To increase the bandwidth of the network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encryption** is a security function, not something sniffers do. Sniffers *read* traffic, not secure it.
- ❌ **Physically connecting** segments is the job of switches, routers, or bridges — not analyzers.
- ❌ **Increasing bandwidth** is a network performance task, unrelated to analysis or sniffing.

# QUESTION 2

What distinguishes a Passive TAP from a SPAN/port mirroring connection?

✅ It physically copies the signal from the cabling to a monitor port.  
❌ It can only monitor encrypted traffic.  
❌ It can increase network speed.  
❌ It requires special software to function.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encrypted traffic** can be seen by both TAPs and SPANs — but only as ciphertext unless decrypted separately.
- ❌ **Increasing network speed** is not a function of any monitoring tool. TAPs don’t accelerate anything.
- ❌ **Special software** is not required for a passive TAP. It’s a hardware device, not a software tool — it just duplicates signals physically.

# QUESTION 3

Which option is used with tcpdump to specify the network interface to listen on?

✅ -i  
❌ -e  
❌ -v  
❌ -w  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **-e**: Shows link-layer headers (like MAC addresses), but doesn’t select the interface.
- ❌ **-v**: Enables verbose output, but again, no control over interface.
- ❌ **-w**: Writes output to a file — used for saving `.pcap` files, not selecting interfaces.

# QUESTION 4

Which open-source tool is mentioned as a graphical packet capture and analysis utility?

❌ Netcat  
❌ Nessus  
✅ Wireshark  
❌ Nmap  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Netcat**: Command-line networking tool for creating connections, not for packet capture or GUI analysis.
- ❌ **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanner, not a packet analyzer.
- ❌ **Nmap**: Port scanner, great for host discovery and service enumeration, but **not** for packet capture or graphical analysis.

---
# QUESTION 5

What does the `-w` switch do in tcpdump?

✅ Writes output to a file  
❌ Reads the contents of a capture file  
❌ Increases the amount of detail shown  
❌ Shows the Ethernet header  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Reads a file**: That’s `-r`, not `-w`.
- ❌ **More detail**: `-v`, `-vv`, or `-vvv` control verbosity.
- ❌ **Ethernet header**: Use `-e` to show link-layer headers (like MAC addresses).

---
# QUESTION 6

In Wireshark, where can you access tools for traffic analysis?

❌ Edit menu  
❌ File menu  
❌ Tools menu  
✅ Statistics menu  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Edit**: For preferences, profiles, and find/replace — not analysis tools.
- ❌ **File**: Used for opening/saving captures, not analyzing them.
- ❌ **Tools**: Wireshark doesn’t have a generic "Tools" menu for analysis (might appear in plugins).

---
# QUESTION 7

Why might an aggregation TAP drop frames under heavy load?

❌ Because it cannot handle encrypted traffic  
❌ Because it requires a direct internet connection  
❌ Because it does not support gigabit signaling  
✅ Because it rebuilds streams into a single channel  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encrypted traffic** is passed through transparently — TAPs don’t care what’s inside the packet.
- ❌ **Internet connection** is irrelevant — TAPs work at Layer 1/2 locally.
- ❌ **Gigabit signaling**: Many modern TAPs *do* support gigabit; this is not the limiting factor.

# QUESTION 8

What is the purpose of using display filters in Wireshark?

❌ To increase the capture speed of packets  
✅ To show only particular frames or sequences of frames  
❌ To delete unwanted packets from the network  
❌ To change the color of the interface  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Capture speed** is unaffected — filtering doesn't make Wireshark faster, it just narrows the view.
- ❌ **Deleting packets** isn't possible — Wireshark is passive, it can’t modify live traffic.
- ❌ **Color settings** are part of appearance preferences, not related to filtering.

---
# QUESTION 9

What is the purpose of installing a special driver for a software-based sniffer?

❌ To encrypt the captured frames  
✅ To allow the frames to be read from the network stack  
❌ To decrease the network's latency  
❌ To increase the sniffer's processing speed  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encryption**: Sniffers read traffic — they don’t encrypt it. That’s a different role entirely.
- ❌ **Latency reduction**: Monitoring tools don’t affect the flow of packets — sniffers are passive.
- ❌ **Processing speed**: Installing a driver doesn’t directly boost CPU performance.

# QUESTION 10

How can the detail of the information shown about each frame be increased in tcpdump?

❌ Using the -w switch  
✅ Using the -v, -vv, or -vvv switches  
❌ Using the -e switch  
❌ Using the -i switch  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **-w**: Writes to a file — no screen output at all.
- ❌ **-e**: Shows link-layer info (MACs), but not more detail about the frame contents.
- ❌ **-i**: Selects the interface — doesn't affect verbosity.
