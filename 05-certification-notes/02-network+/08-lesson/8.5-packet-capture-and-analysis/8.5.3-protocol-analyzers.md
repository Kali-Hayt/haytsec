## 8.5.3 Protocol Analyzers

### üß± What is a Protocol Analyzer?

- A **protocol analyzer** works with a **packet capture (sniffer) tool**.
- It can:
  - Capture live traffic in real time.
  - Open and analyze saved captures (`.pcap` files).
- Many protocol analyzers include the sniffer as part of the same software.

### ‚úÖ Key Functions

- **Frame Parsing**: Breaks down each frame to reveal header fields and payloads in a readable format.
- **Protocol/Service Misconfig Identification**: Helps locate errors in protocols and configurations.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Measures bandwidth, identifies top hosts, tracks link usage and reliability.

---

### üß∞ Example Tool: Wireshark

- Open source, GUI-based packet capture and analysis utility.
- Available for most OS platforms.
- Interface includes:
  - **Top pane**: Lists captured frames.
  - **Middle pane**: Shows decoded fields of selected frame.
  - **Bottom pane**: Displays raw hex and ASCII data.

### üîç Useful Features in Wireshark

- **Display Filters**: Narrow down to specific frames or conversations.
- **Follow TCP Stream**: Reconstructs full TCP session content.
- **Statistics Menu**: Access traffic metrics (protocol usage, top talkers, bandwidth stats, etc.).

### üß± Summary

- Protocol analyzers help you see **what's actually happening on the wire**.
- They're essential for:
  - Troubleshooting
  - Monitoring
  - Security analysis
- Wireshark is the gold standard tool in this space.
