# QUESTION 1

**What distinguishes an application log from a system log?**

- ✅ An application log records data for a single specific service.  
- ❌ An application log records data for the entire operating system.  
- ❌ An application log is only used for security purposes.  
- ❌ An application log cannot record errors.  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Entire operating system* — that's what a **system log** does, not an application log.
- ❌ *Security purposes* — that’s the job of **security logs**, not application logs.
- ❌ *Cannot record errors* — incorrect; application logs **do** record errors like crashes or failed operations.

# QUESTION 2

**What is a key feature of performance/traffic logs?**

- ❌ They serve as backups for application data.  
- ✅ They record metrics for network resources.  
- ❌ They record only security breaches.  
- ❌ They exclusively track user login attempts.  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Backups for app data* — performance/traffic logs don’t back up anything; they monitor behavior and usage.
- ❌ *Only security breaches* — that’s what **security logs** are for.
- ❌ *User login attempts* — that’s the domain of **authentication/access logs**, not traffic logs.

# QUESTION 3

**What type of events does an audit log generally record?**

- ✅ Success/fail type events related to authentication  
- ❌ System configuration backups  
- ❌ Detailed descriptions of all user activities  
- ❌ Performance metrics for compute resources  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *System configuration backups* — that's backup/restore functionality, not audit logging.
- ❌ *All user activities* — audit logs capture *key events* like logins, not full activity logs (that's more SIEM/forensics).
- ❌ *Performance metrics* — those belong to **performance/traffic** logs, not audit logs.

# QUESTION 4

**How can a high priority alert be communicated in an event management system?**

- ❌ By generating a detailed report at the end of the month  
- ❌ By increasing the logging level on all hosts  
- ❌ By displaying it on the system dashboard only  
- ✅ By sending an email to the system administrator  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *End-of-month report* — way too slow for urgent issues like attacks or failures.
- ❌ *Increasing log level* — that just collects more data; it doesn’t notify anyone.
- ❌ *Dashboard only* — assumes someone is actively watching; alerts need to interrupt.

🧠 Real-time alerts = direct comms like email, SMS, or integration with ticketing/incident tools (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie).

# QUESTION 5

**What does a syslog message comprise?**

✅ A PRI code, a header, and a message part  
❌ Only a message part with content  
❌ Only a header containing a timestamp  
❌ A severity level and a message part  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Only a message part* — ignores the required priority and header components.
- ❌ *Only a header with timestamp* — that’s incomplete; no context or content.
- ❌ *Severity level + message* — missing the priority (PRI) and full header.

🧱 A proper syslog message has:
- **PRI (Priority):** facility + severity
- **Header:** timestamp + hostname
- **Message:** actual log content

🧠 Format:  
`<PRI>timestamp hostname TAG: message`

# QUESTION 6

**Why is plotting data as a graph helpful in log analysis?**

✅ It makes it easier to spot trends or spikes in the data.  
❌ It increases the speed of the network.  
❌ It reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored.  
❌ It eliminates the need for software analysis.

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Increases network speed* — graphs don’t improve performance; they just visualize data.
- ❌ *Reduces stored data* — the data still exists; you're just viewing it differently.
- ❌ *Eliminates software analysis* — not true; graphing tools are software analysis tools.

📈 Graphs help spot:
- Sudden traffic surges
- Resource consumption spikes
- Trends over time

# QUESTION 7

**What is an automated event management system configured to generate?**

✅ Some sort of alert  
❌ Detailed reports for every event  
❌ A backup of the logging system  
❌ A list of all devices on the network

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Detailed reports for every event* — that would overload the system; alerts are more efficient for real-time issues.
- ❌ *Backup of the logging system* — backups are handled separately, not by event managers.
- ❌ *List of all devices* — that’s a job for asset discovery tools, not event managers.

📣 Event management is about **detection** and **response** — alerts help you act fast.

# QUESTION 8

**What does log aggregation in the context of SIEM refer to?**

✅ Normalizing data from different sources to make it consistent  
❌ The physical collection of log files from different devices  
❌ Encrypting log files for secure storage  
❌ The process of deleting outdated log files to free up storage space

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Physical collection* — that's log collection, not aggregation. Aggregation is about **processing**, not gathering.
- ❌ *Encryption* — security feature, not aggregation function.
- ❌ *Deleting old logs* — part of log **retention** or **management**, not aggregation.

🧱 **Log aggregation** means pulling together various logs and formatting them into a standard structure for analysis. Think of it like putting all kinds of puzzle pieces into one shape so they fit on the same board — that board is your SIEM.

# QUESTION 9

**What is the purpose of the PRI code in a syslog message?**

✅ To indicate the message's priority  
❌ To specify the protocol used  
❌ To identify the recipient of the message  
❌ To encrypt the message

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Protocol used* — the protocol is syslog itself (usually over UDP 514); PRI doesn’t define it.
- ❌ *Recipient of the message* — syslog doesn’t embed destination info; that’s handled by transport/network layers.
- ❌ *Encryption* — syslog by default isn’t encrypted, and the PRI code has nothing to do with crypto.

🧱 **PRI code** = priority value (severity + facility). It helps sort messages based on urgency and origin.

# QUESTION 10

**How do SIEM tools handle differences in date/time zones among various log sources?**

✅ By normalizing date/time zone differences to a single timeline  
❌ By ignoring date/time information to avoid confusion  
❌ By only accepting logs in the UTC time zone  
❌ By storing logs in separate databases based on their time zones

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Ignoring timestamps* — would destroy correlation. SIEMs exist **because** time matters.
- ❌ *Accepting only UTC* — unrealistic. Not all systems log in UTC; many use local time.
- ❌ *Separate DBs per time zone* — defeats the point of centralized analysis. SIEMs correlate cross-time-zone events.

🧱 SIEMs normalize time by converting logs into a common format (usually UTC) so all events align on one accurate timeline for incident correlation and forensics.
