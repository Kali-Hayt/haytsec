## 8.4.5 Log Reviews

Monitoring captures **real-time** traffic, protocol, and event data.

**Log reviewing (analysis)** happens **after** the fact — used to:
- Inspect and interpret captured log data
- Understand what occurred on the network during the capture
- Identify **performance problems** or **security issues** before they escalate

🔍 **Proactive log review** is critical — waiting until after a major incident is too late.

### 📊 Trend Identification Through Logs

- Most performance issues are **not obvious from a single event**
- Reviewing individual entries makes it hard to detect patterns
- **Graphing log data** helps visualize:
  - Spikes  
  - Troughs  
  - Usage patterns

🧠 **SIEMs, log collectors, and performance monitors** often include graphing capabilities to highlight trends and anomalies over time.

✅ The goal of log review is **early detection** and **pattern analysis**, not just post-incident cleanup.
