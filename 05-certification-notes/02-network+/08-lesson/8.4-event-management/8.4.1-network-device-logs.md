## 8.4.1 Network Device Logs

Network device logs are a critical source of performance, troubleshooting, and security auditing data.

Each logged event typically includes:
- Metadata: date, time, category, event ID
- Description and output: error/informational messages

üîç Example: Use system logs to identify IP conflicts (via TCP/IP events) or determine when/why a system shut down.

While exact logging behavior depends on the platform, common log types include:

---

### üß± System and Application Logs

- **System Log**  
  Records startup events and OS-level configuration changes. Includes kernel, drivers, and core services.

- **Application Log**  
  Records data for a specific service (e.g., DNS, HTTP, database).  
  üîç Complex apps like Apache may use multiple logs ‚Äî errors in one, access attempts in another.

### üõ°Ô∏è Audit Logs

Audit logs track **authentication and authorization** activity.  
- Records both success and failure events.
- May also be labeled as **access logs** or **security logs**.
- Can exist at OS level or per-application level.

### üìä Performance / Traffic Logs

- Compute usage
