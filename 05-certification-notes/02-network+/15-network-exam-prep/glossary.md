|vulnerability assessment|Evaluation of a system's security and ability to meet compliance requirements based on the configuration state of the system, as represented by information collected from the system. Also called vulnerability testing.|

W

|   |   |
|---|---|
|warm site|Alternate processing location that is dormant or performs noncritical functions under normal conditions, but which can be rapidly converted to a key operations site if needed.|
|wi-fi analyzer|Device or software that can report characteristics of a WLAN, such as signal strength and channel utilization.|
|wi-fi protected access (WPA)|Standards for authenticating and encrypting access to Wi-Fi networks. Also called WPA2 and WPA3.|
|wide area networks (WANs)|Network scope that spans a large geographical area, incorporating more than one site and often a mix of different media types and protocols plus the use of public telecommunications networks.|
|wire map tester|Tool to verify termination/pinouts of cable.|
|wireless controller|Device that provides wireless LAN management for multiple APs.|
|wireless mesh network (WMN)|Wireless network topology where all nodes—including client stations—are capable of providing forwarding and path discovery. This improves coverage and throughput compared to using just fixed access points and extenders.|
|wireshark|Widely used protocol analyzer.|
|wiring diagram|Documentation of connector pinouts and/or cable runs.|
|work recovery time (WRT)|In disaster recovery, time additional to the RTO of individual systems to perform reintegration and testing of a restored or upgraded system following an event.|

Y

|   |   |
|---|---|
|yaml ain't markup language (YAML)|Language for configuration files and applications such as Netplan and Ansible.|

Z

|   |   |
|---|---|
|zero trust architecture (ZTA)|The security design paradigm where any request (host-to-host or container-to-container) must be authenticated before being allowed.|
|zero-day|Vulnerability in software that is unpatched by the developer or an attack that exploits such a vulnerability.|
|zone index|Parameter assigned by a host to distinguish ambiguous interface addresses within a link local scope.|
|zone transfer|Mechanism by which a secondary name server obtains a read-only copy of zone records from the primary server.|
