# Lab 4.2.10: Configure IP Addresses on Mobile Devices

## 🧱 Scenario
You're the IT administrator for a small corporate network. A mobile employee needs a working network connection, but the DHCP server isn’t assigning IPs. Your job: manually configure the static IP settings.

## ✅ Task Instructions
Configure a **static IP** on the iPad with the following settings:

- **IP Address:** `192.168.0.85`
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
- **Default Gateway:** `192.168.0.5`
- **DNS Server:** `192.168.0.11`

Then, connect the iPad to the corporate wireless network:

- **Wi-Fi SSID:** (Likely `CorpNet`, confirm in lab interface)
- **Wi-Fi Password:** `@CorpNetWeRSecure!&`

## 💡 Why This Matters
- DHCP is down — you're manually assigning network info.
- These four values (IP, subnet, gateway, DNS) are the **bare minimum** needed to get a device online.
- A proper static config ensures the device communicates on the LAN and resolves hostnames.

## 🧪 Test Connection
After configuration:
- Try opening a web page or app.
- Ping `192.168.0.5` or `192.168.0.11` from the device, if allowed.

## 🔍 Real-World Tip
If you're ever handed an IP, mask, and gateway — this is what you do. No math, no drama. Just enter the values, confirm connectivity, and go.
