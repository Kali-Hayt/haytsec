## 4.2.1 – IPv4 Address Format

### 🧱 IPv4 Address Basics

- IPv4 addresses are **32 bits** long.
- Divided into **four octets** (8 bits each).
- Written in **dotted decimal notation**, like `198.51.100.1`.
- Each octet can range from **0 to 255**.

---

### 🧱 Binary Place Values (8-bit Octet)

Each octet uses powers of 2:
2⁷ 2⁶ 2⁵ 2⁴ 2³ 2² 2¹ 2⁰  
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

When converting:
- A bit of `1` = count that value
- A bit of `0` = skip that value

---

### 🔄 Binary ➡ Decimal (Bit-by-Bit)

#### Example: `11000110`
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0  
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Add the `1` bits only:
128 + 64 + 4 + 2 = 198

✅ Binary `11000110` = Decimal `198`

---

### 🔄 Decimal ➡ Binary (Subtract Method)

#### Example: `198`

Start with the largest number ≤ 198:

- 198 - 128 = 70 → ✅ 1
- 70 - 64 = 6   → ✅ 1
- 6 < 32 → ❌ 0
- 6 < 16 → ❌ 0
- 6 < 8  → ❌ 0
- 6 - 4 = 2   → ✅ 1
- 2 - 2 = 0   → ✅ 1
- Done → last bit = 0

Result: `11000110`

✅ Decimal `198` = Binary `11000110`

### 🧪 Full Example: Convert Binary to IP

**Binary:**
11000110.00110011.01100100.00000001

**Octet Breakdown:**

| Binary         | Decimal Math               | Result |
|----------------|----------------------------|--------|
| `11000110`     | 128+64+4+2                 | 198    |
| `00110011`     | 32+16+2+1                  | 51     |
| `01100100`     | 64+32+4                    | 100    |
| `00000001`     | 1                          | 1      |

✅ IP address: `198.51.100.1`

---

### 📌 Max and Min Values

- **Minimum binary:** `00000000` = `0`
- **Maximum binary:** `11111111` = `255`
- That’s why each octet is limited to **0–255**

---

### 💡 TI-84 Tips (Optional)

- Use **Bin/Dec base mode** to convert on a TI-84 Plus CE
- Not available on basic TI-83/84 models without programming
- Workaround: line up binary with power-of-2 values and add manually

---

### 🏠 Analogy: Think of Octets Like Apartment Mailboxes

- Each octet is like a **box with 8 switches**
- Every switch (`bit`) turned **on** adds a value
- The total sum of all switches that are **on** = your address number

✅ You now understand:
- IPv4 address structure  
- Binary-to-decimal logic  
- Decimal-to-binary logic  
- How devices like routers read and use these numbers
