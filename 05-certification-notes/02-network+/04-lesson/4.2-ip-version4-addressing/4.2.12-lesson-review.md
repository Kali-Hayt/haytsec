# QUESTION 1

What solution addresses the inflexibility of using whole octet boundaries for subnet masks in IP networking?

✅ Dividing networks into subnetworks or subnets  
❌ Increasing the number of IP addresses with IPv6  
❌ Applying Quality of Service (QoS) protocols  
❌ Using dynamic IP addressing  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **IPv6** increases address space, but doesn't solve the inflexibility of octet-based subnetting in IPv4.
- ❌ **QoS protocols** prioritize traffic, not subnetting.
- ❌ **Dynamic IP addressing (DHCP)** handles automatic address assignment, not subnet mask granularity.

# QUESTION 2

What is the primary purpose of a network mask (netmask) in IPv4 addressing?

✅ To distinguish between the network ID and the host ID within an IP address  
❌ To increase the speed of network packet delivery  
❌ To identify the device's hardware address  
❌ To encrypt the IP address for security purposes  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Speed of delivery** isn't affected by subnet masks; routing and bandwidth determine that.
- ❌ **Device hardware addresses** are identified by MAC addresses, not subnet masks.
- ❌ **Encryption** has nothing to do with subnet masks—security measures like IPsec handle that.

# QUESTION 3

What is the classic naming scheme for Ethernet interfaces in Linux?

✅ eth0, eth1, eth2  
❌ en0, en1, en2  
❌ wlan0, wlan1, wlan2  
❌ net0, net1, net2  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **en0/en1/en2** is more typical in macOS or newer Linux systems using `systemd` (predictable naming).
- ❌ **wlan0/wlan1/wlan2** refers to **wireless**, not Ethernet.
- ❌ **net0/net1/net2** is not standard in any major distro—just generic and incorrect here.

# QUESTION 4

A systems administrator is looking into communications issues on a server.  
If the destination IPv4 address is on a different IP network or subnet, where will the host send the traffic?

✅ Default gateway  
❌ CAM  
❌ MTRJ  
❌ SFD  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **CAM (Content Addressable Memory)** is a switch memory structure for MAC addresses—not involved in routing.
- ❌ **MTRJ** is a fiber optic connector—not related to traffic routing at all.
- ❌ **SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)** is a part of an Ethernet frame—not a routing decision-maker.

---
# QUESTION 5

At the Network layer, what are IP source and destination addresses used to do?

✅ Forward packets to the proper destination  
❌ Monitor network traffic and data usage  
❌ Assign specific functions to devices within the network  
❌ Control access to the network based on device types  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Monitor network traffic and data usage** is done by monitoring tools, not by the IP addresses themselves.
- ❌ **Assign specific functions to devices** is more about DHCP roles or application-level configs.
- ❌ **Control access to the network** is a job for security layers, like firewalls or NAC—not the Network layer.

🧱 The Network Layer (Layer 3) is all about routing and IP. It uses the source and destination IP addresses to figure out **where a packet is going and how to get it there**.

# QUESTION 6

A network administrator wants to use a subnet mask containing 62 usable addresses.  
Which of the following subnet masks should the administrator use?

✅ 255.255.255.192  
❌ 255.255.255.224  
❌ 255.255.255.128  
❌ 255.255.255.240  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **255.255.255.224** gives you only 30 usable addresses (2⁵ - 2).
- ❌ **255.255.255.128** gives 126 usable addresses (2⁷ - 2) — too many.
- ❌ **255.255.255.240** gives just 14 usable addresses (2⁴ - 2).

🧱 **255.255.255.192** corresponds to /26, which means 64 total addresses, minus 2 (network + broadcast) = **62 usable**. Perfect match.

🧠 Tip: You don’t need to do math in your head on the exam—just be familiar with the cheat sheet values (like /26 = 62 hosts).

# QUESTION 7

How can IP configuration values be assigned to hosts in a Windows environment?

❌ Manually only  
✅ Either statically or dynamically  
❌ Neither statically nor dynamically  
❌ Dynamically only  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Manually only** ignores DHCP, which is a key part of Windows networking.
- ❌ **Neither statically nor dynamically** is nonsense—Windows supports both methods.
- ❌ **Dynamically only** overlooks static configuration via Control Panel or `netsh`.

🧠 Windows lets you assign IPs:
- **Statically**: You manually input IP, mask, gateway, and DNS.
- **Dynamically**: DHCP server assigns IP settings automatically.

# QUESTION 8

You have a network address of 132.66.0.0 and a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0.  
Which of the following are valid subnet addresses? (Select two.)

❌ 132.130.0.0  
❌ 132.98.0.0  
✅ 132.66.192.0  
✅ 132.66.96.0  
❌ 132.66.255.0  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **132.130.0.0** is not in the 132.66.0.0 network block at all.
- ❌ **132.98.0.0** is from a completely different network.
- ❌ **132.66.255.0** is not a valid *subnet base address*. It’s a host or broadcast inside a subnet.

🧱 Explanation:
- **255.255.224.0** = /19
- That gives increments of **32** in the **third octet**:  
  - 132.66.0.0  
  - 132.66.32.0  
  - 132.66.64.0  
  - 132.66.96.0 ✅  
  - 132.66.128.0  
  - 132.66.160.0  
  - 132.66.192.0 ✅  
  - 132.66.224.0

# QUESTION 9

Why can the first address in an IP network not be assigned to a host?

✅ It is the network address.  
❌ It is used as the broadcast address.  
❌ It is reserved for the default gateway.  
❌ It is reserved for the subnet mask.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Broadcast address** is the *last* address in the subnet, not the first.
- ❌ **Default gateway** is typically assigned to a usable host IP, not a reserved one.
- ❌ **Subnet mask** is a separate configuration—it’s not an address at all.

🧱 Reminder:
- The **first address** in any subnet (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24) is reserved as the **network ID**.  
- It defines the *subnet itself* and can’t be used by any device.

# QUESTION 10

What is the purpose of the persistent configuration in Linux networking?

✅ To configure network settings that are applied after a reboot or reinitialization of a network adapter  
❌ To apply network settings immediately without rebooting  
❌ To configure network settings that are applied only during the current session  
❌ To temporarily override the running configuration until the next reboot  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Apply immediately** = temporary config, not persistent.
- ❌ **Only during current session** = volatile config, often done via `ifconfig` or `ip` command directly.
- ❌ **Temporarily override** = same as non-persistent or runtime config (cleared at reboot).

🧱 Persistent config = set it once, it sticks after reboot. Usually configured in `/etc/network/interfaces` or systemd `.network` files.

# QUESTION 11

In Windows, how can the IP configuration for an Ethernet adapter be set?

✅ Either using the GUI Properties dialog or netsh commands  
❌ Using netsh commands only  
❌ Neither using the GUI Properties dialog nor netsh commands  
❌ Using the GUI Properties dialog only

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Using netsh commands only** – Ignores the graphical method, which is common and user-friendly.
- ❌ **Neither using the GUI Properties dialog nor netsh commands** – False; both are valid and commonly used tools.
- ❌ **Using the GUI Properties dialog only** – Misses the powerful command-line option via `netsh`.

🧱 Windows supports **both GUI and CLI** methods for configuring network adapters, allowing flexibility for user preference or automation.

# QUESTION 12

What can dynamic routing protocols allow routers to do?

✅ Share information about known networks and possible paths  
❌ Assign IP addresses dynamically.  
❌ Increase the speed of packet delivery.  
❌ Encrypt data packets for secure transmission.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Assign IPs dynamically** – That’s the job of DHCP, not routing protocols.
- ❌ **Increase speed of packet delivery** – Routing protocols don't affect actual packet transmission speed, just the *path*.
- ❌ **Encrypt data packets** – That’s handled by protocols like IPSec, not routing protocols.

🧱 Dynamic routing (like OSPF, EIGRP, BGP) helps routers adapt to topology changes without manual reconfiguration.

# QUESTION 13

A host has an address of 100.55.177.99/16. Which of the following is the broadcast address for the subnet?

✅ 100.55.255.255  
❌ 255.255.0.0  
❌ 255.255.255.0  
❌ 100.255.255.255  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **255.255.0.0** – That’s a subnet mask, not a broadcast address.
- ❌ **255.255.255.0** – Also a subnet mask, unrelated to this /16 subnet question.
- ❌ **100.255.255.255** – That’s not the correct broadcast for a /16. It belongs to a different subnet.

🧱 With a /16, the first 16 bits (100.55) define the network.  
The broadcast is the highest possible address in that range: `100.55.255.255`.

# QUESTION 14

What does each octet in an IPv4 address represent in binary notation?

✅ A decimal value between 0 and 255  
❌ A unique network identifier  
❌ A hexadecimal value  
❌ A specific hardware address  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A unique network identifier** – That’s a role the full IP or subnet may play, not each individual octet.
- ❌ **A hexadecimal value** – IPv4 addresses are shown and stored as **decimal**, not hex (unlike MAC addresses).
- ❌ **A specific hardware address** – That’s a MAC address, not an IP address.

🧱 IPv4 is a 32-bit address split into four 8-bit octets. Each 8-bit binary group (00000000 to 11111111) equals a decimal number from **0 to 255**.

# QUESTION 15

What happens to the number of available host addresses when a bit is added to the subnet mask?

✅ It approximately halves.  
❌ It remains the same.  
❌ It increases by a factor of four.  
❌ It doubles.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It remains the same** – Adding a bit *shrinks* the host portion, reducing available addresses.
- ❌ **It increases by a factor of four** – This would require 2 bits added to the host part, not the subnet mask.
- ❌ **It doubles** – Doubling would occur if you removed a bit from the mask (i.e., gave *more* space to hosts).

🧱 Each bit added to the **subnet mask** reduces the number of host bits by 1. Since host addresses = 2ⁿ - 2, fewer host bits ≈ half the usable addresses.
