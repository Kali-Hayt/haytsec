## 4.2.4 – Host Address Ranges

The host portion of an IP address determines how many unique devices (hosts) can exist in that network. Subnetting defines the boundaries for this range.

---

## 🧱 /24 Network Example

A `/24` network (e.g., `198.51.100.0/24`) has:

- **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`
- **Host ID size**: 8 bits
- **Possible host addresses**: `2^8 = 256`
- **Usable host addresses**: `256 - 2 = 254`
  - `198.51.100.0` – network address ❌
  - `198.51.100.255` – broadcast address ❌
  - ✅ Usable range: `198.51.100.1` to `198.51.100.254`

---

## 🧱 /28 Network Example

Subnetting that same `/24` network into **/28** gives:

- **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.240`
- **Host ID size**: 4 bits
- **Possible addresses per subnet**: `2^4 = 16`
- **Usable hosts per subnet**: `16 - 2 = 14`

### Subnet Ranges within `198.51.100.0/24`:

| Subnet         | Usable Host Range         |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| 198.51.100.0/28  | 198.51.100.1 – 198.51.100.14 |
| 198.51.100.16/28 | 198.51.100.17 – 198.51.100.30 |
| 198.51.100.32/28 | 198.51.100.33 – 198.51.100.46 |
| 198.51.100.48/28 | 198.51.100.49 – 198.51.100.62 |

🔍 Notice: Each new subnet adds 16 to the fourth octet (0, 16, 32, 48…)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- The first address in a subnet is always the **network address** ❌
- The last address is the **broadcast address** ❌
- Only addresses between them are **usable host addresses** ✅

## 💡 Subnetting Design Tip

> “Each bit added to the mask approximately **halves** the number of available host addresses.”

### Meaning:
- `/24` → 8 host bits → 254 hosts
- `/25` → 7 bits → 126 hosts
- `/26` → 6 bits → 62 hosts
- `/27` → 5 bits → 30 hosts
- `/28` → 4 bits → 14 hosts
- `/29` → 3 bits → 6 hosts
- `/30` → 2 bits → 2 hosts (used for point-to-point links)
- `/31` and `/32` are special cases 🔍

## 🎯 Purpose of Subnetting

- Breaks larger networks into **smaller broadcast domains**
- Improves traffic efficiency and security
- Helps match the number of hosts to actual needs — **no waste**
