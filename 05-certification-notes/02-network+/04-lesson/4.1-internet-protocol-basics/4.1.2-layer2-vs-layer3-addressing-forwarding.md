## 4.1.2 – Layer 2 vs. Layer 3 Addressing and Forwarding

### 🧱 Layer 2 = Switching | Layer 3 = Routing

When designing or supporting an IP network, it’s crucial to understand how **Layer 3 (Network)** addressing interacts with **Layer 2 (Data Link)** forwarding:

- **Layer 3 forwarding = routing**
- **Layer 2 forwarding = switching**

Each layer plays a different role in directing traffic through the network.

---

### 🧠 Subnet Behavior

- **Within a subnet** (same broadcast domain), devices communicate **directly** using MAC addresses.
- To reach **another subnet**, traffic must pass through a **router**, which uses Layer 3 logic to forward it.

---

### 🔄 Translating Between Layers

Inside each subnet:

- Devices use **MAC addresses** (Layer 2) to send frames.
- A system like **ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to **translate IPs (Layer 3)** into MAC addresses.

---

### 🌐 Mixed-Layer Environments

Layer 3 can bridge different types of Layer 1/2 tech:

- Example:  
  - Private LAN uses **Ethernet**
  - Router’s public side connects via **DSL**, fiber, or coax  
  - IP takes care of routing **across** these technologies

### 💡 Summary

| Layer | Function     | Address Type | Device     |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 2     | Switching    | MAC Address  | Switch     |
| 3     | Routing      | IP Address   | Router     |

> Nodes in the same subnet switch frames.  
> Nodes in different subnets route packets.
