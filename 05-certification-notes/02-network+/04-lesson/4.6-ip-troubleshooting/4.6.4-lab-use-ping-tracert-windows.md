## 🧪 What You Did (Step-by-Step)

1. **Selected the Exec computer** under the *Executive Office* section.
2. **Launched the Terminal (Admin)** from the Start menu.
3. **Confirmed local LAN access** by pinging:
   - `192.168.0.31` (Office2)
   - `192.168.0.10` (CorpServer)

4. **Opened the Exhibits window**, reviewed the IPs:
   - Building A router: `192.168.0.5`
   - ISP router: `198.28.2.254`

5. **Answered Questions 1 and 2** using those IPs.
6. **Used `ipconfig`** to view the Exec PC’s network settings.
   - Default gateway was incorrect: `192.168.0.4`

7. **Pinged the correct Building A router**: `ping 192.168.0.5`
   - Success confirmed router is reachable.

8. **Used `tracert` to reach ISP router**: `tracert 198.28.2.254`
   - Trace failed — due to wrong default gateway.

9. **Manually changed the default gateway**:
   - Opened Network & Internet settings.
   - Edited *Ethernet > IP Assignment*.
   - Changed Gateway from `192.168.0.4` → `192.168.0.5`
   - Clicked Save.

10. **Retested**:
    - `ping 192.168.0.5` → Success.
    - `tracert 198.28.2.254` → Success.
