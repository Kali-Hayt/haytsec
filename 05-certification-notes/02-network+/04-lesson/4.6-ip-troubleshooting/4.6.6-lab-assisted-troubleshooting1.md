## üí° Lab Summary

This was a classic connectivity problem rooted in a **mistyped IP address**. The Home-Laptop had an incorrect IP (`192.169.1.20` instead of `192.168.1.20`), which placed it on the wrong network segment. That small typo broke all communication with the other devices on the LAN.

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Flow:

1. **Verified IP configuration** on both Home-Laptop and Home-PC1.
2. **Confirmed pings failed** from Home-Laptop to other nodes.
3. **Home-PC1 worked fine**, so the issue was localized.
4. **Theory formed:** Laptop was misconfigured.
5. **Solution implemented:** Corrected IP to `192.168.1.20` via GUI.
6. **Tested connectivity:** All pings were successful.

- Gateway correct: `192.168.1.1`
- Verified via ping and task completion
