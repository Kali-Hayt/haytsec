## 🧪 Troubleshooting Process

### 🔍 Step 1 – Inspect Home-Laptop
- Opened Network & Internet settings
- Saw correct IP (`192.168.1.20`), but bad subnet (`255.255.255.240`)
- Pings:
  - Laptop ➡ Gateway ❌
  - Laptop ➡ PC1 ✅
  - Laptop ➡ PC2 ✅

### 🧾 Step 2 – Inspect Home-PC1
- IP: `192.168.1.21`
- Subnet: `255.255.255.0`
- Gateway: `192.168.1.1`
- All ping tests succeed

### 🧠 Step 3 – Diagnosis
- Subnet mask mismatch prevents Home-Laptop from reaching default gateway

### 🔧 Step 4 – Resolution
- Changed Home-Laptop subnet mask from `255.255.255.240` to `255.255.255.0`
- Saved settings

### ✅ Step 5 – Verification
- Ping tests from Home-Laptop:
  - ✅ `Home-PC1`
  - ✅ `Home-PC2`
  - ✅ `192.168.1.1`
- Internet icon now shows connected status
