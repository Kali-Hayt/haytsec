## 📘 IPv6 Network Prefixes

### 🧱 Structure Breakdown
- An IPv6 address is divided into **two parts**:
  - **Network ID** (first 64 bits)
  - **Interface ID** (last 64 bits)
- Unlike IPv4, the interface portion is **always 64 bits** — consistent and fixed.

---

### 💡 Network Prefix Notation
- IPv6 uses **CIDR-style** slash notation:  
  - `/n` = prefix length (just like `/24` in IPv4)
- Example:  
  - `2001:db8:3c4d::/48` → network  
  - `2001:db8:3c4d:0001::/64` → a subnet inside that network

---

### 🧱 Hierarchy Logic
- The **first 48 bits** might represent the global routing prefix (organization level)
- The **next 16 bits** can be used for internal subnetting
- The **last 64 bits** = device/interface address

---

### ✅ Address Types Still Supported
- IPv6 still uses:
  - **Unicast** – one-to-one
  - **Multicast** – one-to-many
  - **Anycast** – one-to-nearest
- ❌ **No broadcast** in IPv6 — it's gone

### 🔍 Key Insight
> In IPv4, network and host portions vary by subnet mask.  
> In IPv6, **host = always last 64 bits** — it’s baked into the design.

---

### 🧠 Analogy
> Think of the IPv6 network like a **campus**:  
> - The first 48 bits = the school  
> - The next 16 bits = buildings (subnets)  
> - The last 64 bits = individual room numbers (interfaces)
