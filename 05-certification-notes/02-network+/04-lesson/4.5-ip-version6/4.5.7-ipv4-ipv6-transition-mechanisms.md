# 4.5.7 ‚Äì IPv4 and IPv6 Transition Mechanisms

## üåê The Problem

Networks need to support **both IPv4 and IPv6** during the transition period. There are 3 main strategies:

- **Dual Stack**
- **Tunneling**
- **Translation (NAT64)**

---

## üß± Dual Stack

- Devices run **both IPv4 and IPv6** protocols at the same time.
- Can talk to either IPv4 or IPv6 hosts depending on what's needed.
- Most systems **prefer IPv6** if both are available.
- No encapsulation or conversion needed ‚Äî just full support for both protocols.
  
üì∏ **Screenshot**: `ipconfig /all` shows both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on the same adapter.

## üì¶ Tunneling

Used when IPv6 traffic needs to travel across IPv4 networks.

- Wrap IPv6 packets **inside IPv4 packets** like a delivery envelope.
- Decapsulated at the destination.

### 3 Tunneling Methods:

- **6to4** (prefix `2002::/16`)  
  ‚ùå Deprecated ‚Äî replaced by 6RD.
- **Teredo**  
  - Microsoft method.
  - Sends IPv6 via IPv4 UDP (port 3544).
  - Works through NAT.
- **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)**  
  - Legacy tunneling protocol.
  - Encapsulates many types of packets.
  - Still valid for both IPv4 and IPv6 today.

‚ö†Ô∏è Tunneling increases **overhead** and complexity. Not as efficient as dual stack.

## üîÑ NAT64 (Network Address Translation ‚Äì IPv6 to IPv4)

Translates IPv6 addresses to IPv4 for compatibility.

- Uses **`64:ff9b::/96`** prefix + embedded IPv4 address.
- When IPv6-only host wants to talk to IPv4:
  - NAT64 router converts IPv6 to IPv4 on the fly.
  - Replies from the IPv4 host are tracked and sent back through the NAT.

‚úÖ Most useful in environments with **IPv6-only clients** needing access to legacy IPv4 services.

## Summary

| Mechanism   | Purpose                            | Notes                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Dual Stack  | Full support for both IPv4 & IPv6  | Most efficient, most widely used                   |
| Tunneling   | IPv6 through IPv4                  | Temporary, has overhead, multiple methods exist     |
| NAT64       | IPv6-to-IPv4 translation           | Works best when clients are IPv6-only               |
