# QUESTION 1  
What is the primary purpose of IPv6 link local addresses?

✅ To enable communication within a single subnet without the need for a router  
❌ To provide global internet connectivity  
❌ To encrypt data packets for secure communication  
❌ To assign addresses for email servers  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Global internet connectivity* uses global unicast, not link-local.  
- ❌ *Encryption* is handled by IPsec or higher-layer protocols, not by address type.  
- ❌ *Email servers* don’t rely on link-local addressing — they use public DNS-resolvable IPs.

# QUESTION 2  
What does flipping the 7th bit of the first octet in a MAC address to form an EUI-64 address accomplish?

✅ It differentiates the modified address from the original MAC address.  
❌ It converts the address to a link-local address.  
❌ It signifies that the address is now private.  
❌ It indicates that the address is multicast.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Link-local* scope is defined by the prefix (`fe80::/10`), not the MAC bit manipulation.  
- ❌ *Private* is not relevant to MAC-to-EUI-64 conversion — it applies to IP ranges.  
- ❌ *Multicast* is identified by special address ranges like `ff00::/8`, not bit flips in the MAC.

# QUESTION 3  
Consider the following IPv6 address:  
`FE80:0000:0000:0000:0055:0000:0000:000A:AB00`

Which of the following are valid shortened forms of this address? (Select two.)

✅ FE80::55:0000:0000:A:AB00  
✅ FE80:0000:0000:0055::000A:AB00  
❌ FE80::55::A:AB00  
❌ FE80::0055::000A:AB  
❌ FE80::55::A:AB

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **FE80::55::A:AB**: You can't use `::` more than once in an IPv6 address.  
- ❌ **FE80::0055::000A:AB**: Same issue — double compression is invalid.  
- ❌ **FE80::55::A:AB00**: Same mistake again — only one `::` is allowed.

🧱 Correct shortening rules:  
- Only one `::` per IPv6 address  
- Leading zeros within blocks can be dropped  
- Entire blocks of `0000` can be compressed into `::` once

🧠 Tip:  
Double-check for accidental *double colons*. It’s an easy mistake that’ll fail validation every time.

# QUESTION 4  
Which of the following is true about the scope of IPv6 global unicast addresses?

✅ They occupy 1/8th of the total IPv6 address space.  
❌ They are equivalent to private IPv4 addresses.  
❌ They are not routable over the Internet.  
❌ They are primarily used for broadcasting messages.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Private IPv4 equivalents* would be Unique Local Addresses (`fc00::/7`), not global unicast.  
- ❌ *Not routable over the Internet* — global unicast **is** internet-routable by design.  
- ❌ *Broadcasting* doesn’t exist in IPv6; multicast replaces it. Global unicast isn’t used for this at all.
---
# QUESTION 5  
What does the classless notation "/64" signify in an IPv6 network address?

✅ The first 64 bits are reserved for the network prefix.  
❌ The last 64 bits are used for multicast addressing.  
❌ The address is divided into 64 subnets.  
❌ The first 64 bits specify the portion of 64 bits are the global routing prefix.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Multicast* uses special prefixes (`ff00::/8`), not the last 64 bits of unicast addresses.  
- ❌ *Divided into 64 subnets* — misleading. `/64` means one subnet, not 64.  
- ❌ *Global routing prefix* is only part of the first 64 bits — not the entire thing in this context.
---
# QUESTION 6  
In IPv6, what does a network prefix of /48 indicate?

✅ The first 48 bits are used for network addressing.  
❌ The interface identifier is 48 bits long.  
❌ The network has 48 subnets.  
❌ The address is a multicast address.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Interface identifier* is always 64 bits in standard IPv6 unicast addressing — not 48.  
- ❌ *48 subnets* — misleading. A /48 allows **65,536** /64 subnets, not just 48.  
- ❌ *Multicast* addresses start with `ff00::/8`, unrelated to the /48 prefix space.
---
# QUESTION 7  
What do the first 8 bits of an IPv6 multicast address indicate?

✅ The address is within the multicast scope.  
❌ The address is used for Neighbor Discovery protocol.  
❌ The address is within the unicast scope.  
❌ The address is reserved for anycast addressing.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Neighbor Discovery* uses a **specific multicast group**, but the first 8 bits (`11111111` or `ff`) only tell us it's multicast — not the exact protocol.  
- ❌ *Unicast scope* uses prefixes like `2000::/3` (global) or `fe80::/10` (link-local).  
- ❌ *Anycast* uses regular unicast addresses — there's no reserved range for anycast, and no unique prefix.
---
# QUESTION 8  
Which of the following are elements of an IPv6 packet? (Select two.)

✅ Main header  
✅ Extension headers  
❌ TTL (Time to Live)  
❌ Checksum  
❌ Options field  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *TTL* is replaced in IPv6 by the **Hop Limit** field.  
- ❌ *Checksum* was removed in IPv6 to reduce overhead and simplify processing.  
- ❌ *Options field* is not part of the main header — IPv6 uses **extension headers** instead for optional features.

🧱 IPv6 headers are simpler than IPv4: fixed main header + optional chained extensions.

---
# QUESTION 9  
Which of the following is typically preferred for interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6 due to its efficiency?

✅ Dual Stack  
❌ NAT64  
❌ Tunneling  
❌ 6to4 automatic tunneling  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *NAT64* translates IPv6 to IPv4 — helpful but adds complexity and overhead.  
- ❌ *Tunneling* encapsulates one protocol inside another (like IPv6 in IPv4) — it's a workaround, not efficient long-term.  
- ❌ *6to4* is outdated and deprecated — too many issues with reliability and routing.

🧱 **Dual Stack** means devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously, enabling direct communication in both protocols. It’s the cleanest, most efficient method.

# QUESTION 10  
How does IPv6 anycast addressing differ from multicast addressing?

✅ Anycast uses a single address for multiple interfaces globally.  
❌ Multicast uses a special range of addresses for routing protocols.  
❌ Multicast sends a packet from a single source to a single interface.  
❌ Anycast allows a packet to be sent from multiple sources to a single interface.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Multicast routing protocols* do exist, but that’s not the main distinction here.  
- ❌ *Multicast is one-to-many*, not one-to-one — the second option confuses it with unicast.  
- ❌ *Anycast from multiple sources* isn’t how it works — anycast is still source-to-destination, but it reaches the **nearest destination**.

🧱 **Key difference:**  
- **Multicast**: one-to-many delivery  
- **Anycast**: one-to-nearest-one delivery (still uses a “many destinations, one address” setup)

# QUESTION 11  
What is the prefix notation for globally unique unicast IPv6 addresses commonly referred to as?

✅ /48  
❌ /32  
❌ /64  
❌ /128  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **/32**: Assigned to ISPs by RIRs — it's not what's typically seen at the organizational or enterprise level.  
- ❌ **/64**: Standard for subnetting (interface ID split), but not used as a *global routing prefix*.  
- ❌ **/128**: Represents a single IPv6 address — not a routable *network* prefix.

🧱 Globally unique unicast addresses:
- Begin with **2000::/3**
- Often assigned as **/48 blocks** for enterprises or organizations to allow subnetting flexibility.

🔍 Real-world example:
- Your org gets `2001:0db8:1234::/48`, and you carve out `/64` subnets inside it.

# QUESTION 12  
What does IPv6 use to replace the Options field found in IPv4 headers?

✅ Extension headers  
❌ Hop Limit  
❌ Traffic Class  
❌ Flow Label  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Hop Limit**: Replaces TTL (Time to Live), not Options.  
- ❌ **Traffic Class**: Used for QoS and priority handling, unrelated to optional header data.  
- ❌ **Flow Label**: Identifies packet flows for special handling, not a field expansion mechanism.

🧱 IPv6 Extension Headers:
- Optional, modular headers inserted after the main header.
- Examples: Fragment, Routing, Destination Options, Authentication, ESP.
- Keeps the base IPv6 header lean and efficient.

📦 Think of extension headers like plug-in cards:
> "Only insert what you need — no extra baggage unless the payload demands it."

# QUESTION 13  
Which of the following statements correctly describes the use of canonical notation in IPv6 addresses?

✅ Canonical notation allows leading zeros in each 16-bit block of an IPv6 address to be ignored, and one contiguous series of zeros to be replaced by a double colon (::).  
❌ Canonical notation allows multiple contiguous series of zeros in an IPv6 address to be replaced by double colons (::).  
❌ Canonical notation allows multiple contiguous series of zeros in an IPv6 address to be replaced by double colons (::).  
❌ Canonical notation requires that all zeros in an IPv6 address be explicitly represented, without any compression.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Multiple double colons**: Canonical notation only allows **one `::`**, not multiple.  
- ❌ **All zeros represented explicitly**: Canonical means *simplified but unambiguous*, not uncompressed.  
- ❌ **Duplicate answer (multiple `::`)**: Repeating the same false idea doesn’t make it truer—still wrong.

🧱 Canonical IPv6 Notation Rules:
- Only **one** `::` allowed per address  
- **Leading zeros** in each hextet are dropped  
- Prefer longest consecutive block of zeroes for compression  
- Ensures consistency in display (not a "raw" representation)

🧠 Tip: Think of canonical as *“clean and unique”*, not *“verbose and raw”*.

# QUESTION 14  
What is the role of a zone index in IPv6 link-local addressing?

✅ To make the address unique to a particular link  
❌ To increase the address space  
❌ To encrypt the address  
❌ To provide global routing information  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ Increase address space: Not the purpose—zone index doesn't add to the address range.  
- ❌ Encrypt the address: Zone index is about **scope**, not security.  
- ❌ Global routing info: Link-local addresses aren't even **routable** beyond a single link.

🧱 Zone Index:
- Usually shown like `fe80::1%eth0` or `fe80::1%5`
- That `%` value (interface index or name) tells the OS **which interface** to use when sending to that link-local address.
- Essential on dual-interface hosts—because **every link** has its own `fe80::/10` pool.

🔍 Without a zone ID, you can't differentiate between multiple `fe80::` addresses on separate interfaces!

# QUESTION 15  
What prefix do 6to4 addresses use?

✅ 2002::/16  
❌ 6RD::/16  
❌ 3544::/16  
❌ 64:ff9b::/96  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ 6RD::/16: That’s **6rd (Rapid Deployment)**, a different IPv6 transition mechanism—not 6to4.  
- ❌ 3544::/16: Not a valid prefix for any IPv6 standard transition technique.  
- ❌ 64:ff9b::/96: This is used for **NAT64**—IPv6-to-IPv4 translation, not tunneling.

🧱 6to4 (RFC 3056):
- Automatically generates an IPv6 address from an IPv4 one.
- Prefix: `2002:<IPv4-addr>:<Subnet>::/48`
- It’s an older transition method, largely deprecated but still tested.

📦 Example:
IPv4: `192.0.2.4`  
→ 6to4: `2002:c000:0204::/48`

🔍 Use case: Rapid deployment of IPv6 without native support.
