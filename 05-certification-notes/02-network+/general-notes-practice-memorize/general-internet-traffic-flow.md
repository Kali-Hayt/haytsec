## 🌐 General Internet Traffic Flow (Outbound and Inbound)

### ✅ Outbound Traffic (From You to the Internet)

1. **Device (PC, phone, etc.)**  
   - Creates a packet with a destination IP (e.g., a website, service)  
   - Sends it to its **default gateway** (your local router)

2. **Local Router (Gateway)**  
   - Forwards packet toward the **ISP** or **enterprise edge**  
   - May do **NAT** to translate private IP to public IP

3. **ISP or Corporate Edge Router**  
   - Routes packet into the **public internet**

4. **Internet Backbone**  
   - Packet hops between various routers and providers

5. **Destination Server** (e.g., Google, AWS, remote office)  
   - Receives your packet  
   - Sends back a response

### 🔁 Inbound Traffic (From Internet Back to You)

1. **Destination Server**  
   - Sends reply to your **public IP**

2. **ISP Edge Router**  
   - Forwards it to your **organization’s edge firewall/router**

3. **Firewall / NAT Gateway**  
   - Translates public IP back to your **private IP**  
   - Checks firewall rules to allow traffic

4. **Internal Routers/Switches**  
   - Forward packet to the right subnet

5. **Your Device**  
   - Receives the response

### 🧠 Notes

- **NAT (Network Address Translation)** is used to allow multiple private devices to share one public IP
- Firewalls may block unexpected inbound traffic unless it’s part of an established connection
- In most cases, **only outbound connections** are allowed unless specific inbound rules are configured

> 🧭 Every internet request takes a multi-hop path out and must return through the same route—or at least one that knows how to reach you.
