## ⚖️ Regulatory Compliance

**Regulatory compliance** refers to externally imposed legal requirements that dictate:
- What controls must be deployed
- How frequently audits occur
- How data must be handled

🛠️ These rules are enforced through **external audits** to verify compliance—often industry- or jurisdiction-specific.

### 🔐 Personal Data & GDPR

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** includes:
- Direct identifiers: SSN, name, email, phone, address
- Indirect combinations: Full name + birthdate + address

**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** – EU privacy law that governs how PII is:
- Collected
- Processed
- Stored
- Deleted

📌 Key principles:
- Must obtain **informed consent** for data collection
- Consent must be clear, not hidden in legalese
- Subjects have the right to:
  - Withdraw consent
  - Inspect, amend, or delete their data

💡 *Informed consent = You must say what you’re collecting, why, and what users can do about it.*

### 🌍 Data Locality & Sovereignty

Data isn’t just regulated by **who it belongs to**, but **where it's stored** and **processed**.

- **Data Locality** – Physical location of storage matters for legal compliance  
  _e.g., storing EU data in the U.S. may violate EU laws without proper safeguards._

- **Data Sovereignty** – Laws of the **data's location** control how it must be handled  
  _e.g., GDPR follows EU citizens even outside the EU._

📦 Cloud platforms often provide **locality tools** to keep sensitive data within a legal boundary.

### 💳 PCI DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

PCI DSS is a **vertical compliance standard** (specific to payment processing).

Applies to:  
Any organization that **handles credit card data** (CDE = Cardholder Data Environment)

**Key protected data:**
- Card number
- Expiry date
- CVV
- Name + billing address (if abuse is suspected)

🧱 PCI DSS requires controls like:
- Data encryption
- Access restrictions
- Breach notification processes
- Secure data handling (storage, retention, destruction)

📌 Cardholder data must **never be stored or transmitted improperly**, especially CVV and PIN.

## ✅ Summary

- **Regulatory compliance** = legally enforced controls
- **PII** = personal data, protected by laws like **GDPR**
- **Data locality** = where data lives matters legally
- **PCI DSS** = focused on safeguarding payment info
