## 🎭 Deception Technologies

**Deception and disruption technologies** are cybersecurity tools that:
- Increase attacker **cognitive load**
- Force adversaries to waste time, tools, and energy
- Provide defenders with **early detection** and **behavioral intel**

These techniques work by presenting **false targets** designed to lure attackers.

---

### 🪤 Honeypots and Honeynets

- A **honeypot** is a **decoy system** designed to attract attackers.  
  It mimics a vulnerable asset but has no real business value.

- A **honeynet** is a full **network of honeypots**, simulating a live environment.  
  May use real systems or emulators.

🎯 Purpose:
- Trick attackers into engaging
- Monitor their tactics, techniques, and procedures (**TTPs**)
- Gather threat intel before real systems are targeted

---

### 📍 Deployment Strategies

Honeypots are commonly placed:
- In **DMZs** (between public and private zones)
- In **segregated, closely monitored** segments of a private network
- Outside firewall-protected zones to **catch early probes**

⚠️ These systems **do not block** attacks—they **detect and delay**.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Deception tech** = psychological defense: confuse, delay, expose
- **Honeypot** = bait system; **honeynet** = entire bait network
- Valuable for **early warnings**, **intel gathering**, and **TTP analysis**
