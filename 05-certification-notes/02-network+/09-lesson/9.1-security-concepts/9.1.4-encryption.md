## 🔐 Encryption

Encryption supports the **CIA triad**, especially **Confidentiality**, by controlling how subjects (users, systems, processes) interact with objects (data, services, files).

### 🛂 Access Control & Logical Security

- **Access control** defines *who can do what* to a resource (object).
- **Subjects** = users, devices, or processes.
- **Objects** = files, databases, servers, etc.
- Logical security (software-based) is often implemented using **encryption**.

### 🧠 Types of Cryptographic Algorithms

- **Encryption Algorithm**  
  Converts **plaintext → ciphertext** using a key.  
  🔑 Decryption requires the same or a paired key.  
  ✅ Ensures **confidentiality** of data.

- **Cryptographic Hash Algorithm**  
  Converts input into a **fixed-length hash**.  
  ❌ Cannot be reversed.  
  ✅ Used for:
  - Verifying **data integrity**
  - **Password storage**
  - Authentication tokens

### 🧱 Data States (Where Encryption Applies)

1. **Data at rest** – Stored on disk (HDD, SSD, DBs)  
   _e.g., full-disk encryption, encrypted backups_

2. **Data in transit** – Moving over a network  
   _e.g., TLS for web traffic, VPNs, secure email_

3. **Data in use** – Being processed in memory  
   _e.g., CPU registers, RAM during runtime_

💡 All three states must be protected to prevent data leakage or compromise.

### 🧰 Examples of Protection by State

- **At Rest:**  
  - Self-encrypting drives  
  - File system or database encryption

- **In Transit:**  
  - TLS (Transport Layer Security)  
  - SSH, IPSec, HTTPS

- **In Use:**  
  - Memory protections  
  - Secure enclaves / hardware security modules (HSMs)

---

## ✅ Summary

- Encryption ≠ just scrambling data—it’s a **core logical control** for confidentiality.
- Two algorithm types: **reversible (encryption)** and **non-reversible (hashing)**.
- Encryption must cover **data at rest**, **in transit**, and **in use**.
