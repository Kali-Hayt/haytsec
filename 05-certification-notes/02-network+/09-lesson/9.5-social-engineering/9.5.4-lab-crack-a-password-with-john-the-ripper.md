## 9.5.4 – Crack a Password with John the Ripper
You are tasked with recovering passwords using the **John the Ripper** password cracking tool on a Linux system and a ZIP file. This lab demonstrates real-world techniques for offline password attacks using hashed credentials.
## ✅ Objective Summary
- Crack the Linux system password stored in `/etc/shadow`.
- Crack a password-protected ZIP archive using `zip2john`.
## 🔑 Cracked Passwords
- **Linux user password**: `1worm4b8`
- **ZIP file password**: `p@ssw0rd`
## 🧱 Part 1 – Crack Linux System Password
1. Open Terminal from the Favorites bar.  
2. Navigate to John the Ripper's directory:  
   `cd /usr/share/john`  
3. List the files in the directory:  
   `ls`  
4. View a sample password list:  
   `cat password.lst`  
5. Return to the root directory:  
   `cd`  
6. Start cracking Linux system passwords:  
   `john /etc/shadow`  
   - John uses the default wordlist and rule set to attempt cracking the hashes.  
   - Password cracked: `1worm4b8`  
7. Re-run the command to observe that John skips known hashes:  
   `john /etc/shadow`  
8. View the `.pot` file (passwords John has already cracked):  
   `cat ~/.john/john.pot`  
9. Alternate way to show cracked passwords:  
   `john /etc/shadow --show`
## 🔐 Part 2 – Crack ZIP File Password
1. Navigate: Top left → **Floor 1 Overview** → **IT-Laptop**  
2. Open Terminal from the Favorites bar.  
3. Check for the `.zip` file:  
   `ls`  
4. Extract the hash from the ZIP archive:  
   `zip2john protected.zip > ziphash.txt`  
5. Confirm the hash is written:  
   `cat ziphash.txt`  
6. Start cracking the ZIP password:  
   `john --format=pkzip ziphash.txt`  
7. View the cracked password:  
   `john ziphash.txt --show`  
   - Password cracked: `p@ssw0rd`
## 🧠 Key Concepts
**John the Ripper**  
- A fast, flexible password cracker that supports multiple hash formats.  
- Stores cracked hashes in `~/.john/john.pot`.  
- Skips already-cracked entries to save resources.  
**/etc/shadow**  
- Contains hashed passwords for Linux user accounts.  
- Requires elevated access to read.  
**zip2john**  
- Converts a password-protected ZIP file into a hash digest that John can analyze.  
**--format=pkzip**  
- Required flag to specify correct hash type when working with ZIP files.
## 🚩 Best Practices
- Use John on isolated/offline systems, never production.
- Favor long, complex passwords to delay brute-force success.
- Monitor `.pot` file output regularly.
- Restrict `/etc/shadow` permissions and log access attempts.
## 🧪 Common John Commands
`john /etc/shadow` – Crack a shadow file  
`john /etc/shadow --show` – Show cracked passwords  
`cat ~/.john/john.pot` – View stored cracked hashes  
`zip2john protected.zip > ziphash.txt` – Extract ZIP hash  
`john --format=pkzip ziphash.txt` – Crack ZIP password  
`john ziphash.txt --show` – Show cracked ZIP password
## ✅ Lab Complete
You've demonstrated the ability to:  
- Perform offline password attacks using John the Ripper  
- Understand password storage in Linux  
- Extract and crack password hashes from ZIP files  
- Interpret output files and use `.pot` storage effectively
