## 9.5.2 – Password Attacks

### 🧱 Attack Vectors

- **On-path attacks** (like MITM) and **malware-based intrusions** often aim to harvest credentials.
- Once initial access is gained, attackers usually try to **escalate privileges** by stealing **admin credentials**.

### 🔍 Credential Capture Techniques

- **Password file theft** – attacker accesses local files with stored hashes or cleartext passwords.
- **Sniffing network traffic** – especially dangerous if:
  - The protocol transmits **cleartext credentials**.
  - Example: Telnet or HTTP, where passwords can be read directly from packets.

---

## 🧱 Cryptographic Hashing

- Passwords are not usually stored in plaintext.
- They are hashed using algorithms like:
  - ✅ SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)
  - ✅ MD5 (Message Digest v5)

- A hash:
  - Is a **fixed-length** representation of the password.
  - Is **one-way** – cannot be reversed to reveal the original password.
  - Should not be decipherable, even by sysadmins.

## 🔓 Password Cracking Methods

### 📖 Dictionary Attacks

- Matches password hashes to hashes of **common words** (e.g., “password123”).
- Also checks:
  - Usernames
  - Company names
  - Pet names, birthdays, etc.
- Naive password choices fall quickly.

### 💣 Brute Force Attacks

- Tries **every possible combination**.
- If the password is:
  - Short (<8 characters)
  - Only letters (non-complex)
  - → can be cracked in **minutes**.
- Longer and more complex = exponentially more time.

---

## 🔐 Defense: Encryption

- Attackers might sniff hashes from protocols like **SMB** (if encryption is disabled).
- Use **end-to-end encryption** protocols:
  - ✅ IPSec
  - ✅ TLS
- When encryption is used:
  - All payload data is protected.
  - Even password hashes can't be captured by sniffers.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Credential theft is often step one in a larger compromise.
- Weak passwords and unencrypted traffic are low-hanging fruit for attackers.
- Always prefer encrypted channels and enforce strong password policies.
