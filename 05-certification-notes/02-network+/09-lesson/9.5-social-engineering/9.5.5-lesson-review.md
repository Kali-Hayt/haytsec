# QUESTION 1  
Which of the following examples BEST describes shoulder surfing?

❌ Finding someone's password in the trash can and using it to access their account  
❌ Giving someone you trust your username and account password  
❌ Guessing someone's password because it is so common or simple  
✅ Someone nearby watching you enter your password on your computer and recording it  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Trash can password hunting* = dumpster diving, not shoulder surfing.  
- ❌ *Giving someone your password* is voluntary sharing, not spying.  
- ❌ *Guessing simple passwords* is brute-force or guessing, not observation.

# QUESTION 2  
On your way into the back entrance of your work building one morning, a man dressed as a plumber asks you to let him in so he can fix the restroom.  
What should you do?

❌ Tell him no and quickly close the door.  
✅ Direct him to the front entrance and instruct him to check in with the receptionist.  
❌ Let him in and help him find the restroom. Then let him work.  
❌ Let him in.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Slamming the door* could escalate the situation; not professional or protocol-compliant.  
- ❌ *Helping him inside* breaks physical security and bypasses vetting.  
- ❌ *Just letting him in* is exactly what social engineers want—unauthorized access.

# QUESTION 3  
What is a common way for threat actors to gain access to a network?

❌ By sending formal requests for access to the IT department  
✅ By obtaining credentials to access the network  
❌ By guessing the network IP address  
❌ By physically breaking into server rooms  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Formal access requests* aren’t used by threat actors—they exploit, not ask.  
- ❌ *Guessing an IP address* doesn’t help without valid credentials or exploits.  
- ❌ *Physically breaking in* is risky, noisy, and rare compared to credential theft.

# QUESTION 4  
Why are longer and more complex passwords more secure against brute force attacks?

✅ They increase the amount of time the attack takes to run.  
❌ They take less time to crack.  
❌ They are less likely to be stored in password files.  
❌ They are easier to remember.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Less time to crack?* Nope—longer + complex = exponentially more guesses needed.  
- ❌ *Password files* don’t care about complexity; they store whatever users create.  
- ❌ *Easier to remember* is a usability trait, not a security benefit.

# QUESTION 5  
Which password cracking method involves trying every possible combination to find the matching password?

❌ Social Engineering  
✅ Brute Force  
❌ Dictionary  
❌ Phishing  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Social Engineering* manipulates humans, not machines or hashes.  
- ❌ *Dictionary* uses known word lists, not full permutations.  
- ❌ *Phishing* tricks users into revealing their password; no cracking involved.
