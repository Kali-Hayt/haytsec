# QUESTION 1

What is a common consequence of rogue devices and services in a network?

✅ Creation of new unmonitored attack surfaces.  
❌ Reduction in IT department workload.  
❌ Improved network efficiency.  
❌ Increased network security.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Reduction in IT department workload*: Rogue devices usually increase workload due to investigation and remediation needs.
- ❌ *Improved network efficiency*: Rogue devices disrupt normal operations, often degrading performance.
- ❌ *Increased network security*: They undermine security by introducing unknown and potentially malicious endpoints.

# QUESTION 2

What is a DHCP starvation attack?

✅ An attack that exhausts a DHCP server's address pool  
❌ An attack that physically damages the DHCP server  
❌ An attack that floods the network with excessive data  
❌ An attack that encrypts all DHCP traffic  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Physically damages the DHCP server*: That would be physical sabotage, not a network-layer attack.
- ❌ *Floods the network with excessive data*: That's more like a DoS (Denial of Service), not DHCP starvation.
- ❌ *Encrypts all DHCP traffic*: DHCP traffic isn't typically encrypted, and that's not how starvation works.

# QUESTION 3

Which of the following is a potential consequence of a rogue DHCP server changing the default gateway address for a subnet?

✅ Routing communications through the attacker's machine  
❌ Improved network security and encryption  
❌ Increased internet speed for all clients  
❌ Automatic resolution of IP address conflicts  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Improved network security and encryption*: A rogue DHCP server is a security risk, not a benefit.
- ❌ *Increased internet speed*: Routing through an attacker’s box typically slows things down — or worse.
- ❌ *Automatic resolution of IP address conflicts*: Rogue DHCP introduces *conflicts*, it doesn’t solve them.

# QUESTION 4

What is the purpose of the HOSTS file in DNS resolution?

✅ To map domain names to IP addresses  
❌ To store the user's browsing history  
❌ To act as a backup for DNS servers  
❌ To log DNS query errors  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Browsing history*: That’s handled by browsers, not the HOSTS file.
- ❌ *Backup for DNS servers*: The HOSTS file is a static local lookup, not a dynamic failover system.
- ❌ *Log DNS errors*: Logs are managed by resolvers or the OS, not the HOSTS file.

---
# QUESTION 5

What is the MOST likely cause of clients ending up with an incorrect IP configuration?

✅ A rogue DHCP server on the network  
❌ Overloaded network traffic  
❌ A faulty Ethernet cable  
❌ Incorrect subnet mask settings on the client  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Overloaded traffic*: May slow things down, but it doesn’t assign IPs.
- ❌ *Ethernet cable*: Could cause no connection, but not *incorrect* IP config.
- ❌ *Subnet mask settings*: Manual errors do cause issues—but not en masse like a rogue DHCP server can.

# QUESTION 6

What is DNS spoofing?

✅ Using false DNS requests or replies  
❌ Manipulating cached DNS records  
❌ Attacking the physical infrastructure of DNS servers  
❌ Infecting DNS servers with malware  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Cached records manipulation*: That’s DNS cache poisoning—not quite the same.
- ❌ *Physical attacks*: That’s straight-up sabotage, not spoofing.
- ❌ *Malware infections*: Could lead to DNS tampering, but it’s not what spoofing directly means.

---
# QUESTION 7

What is DNS server cache poisoning?

✅ Inserting false domain:IP mappings into a DNS server's cache  
❌ Physically damaging a DNS server to take it offline  
❌ Infecting a DNS server with malware to disrupt its operation  
❌ Stealing sensitive information from a DNS server's cache  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Physical damage*: That’s a hardware-level denial of service, not poisoning.
- ❌ *Malware infection*: Could impact DNS, but not cache poisoning specifically.
- ❌ *Data theft*: That’s more like DNS enumeration or exfiltration—not poisoning.

---
# QUESTION 8

What is a common indicator of a compromised machine in the context of DNS attacks?

✅ Suspect entries in the HOSTS file  
❌ High CPU usage  
❌ Slow internet connection  
❌ Frequent system crashes  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *High CPU usage*: Could signal malware, but not specific to DNS-based compromise.
- ❌ *Slow internet*: Too vague—many things cause this.
- ❌ *System crashes*: Rare in DNS spoofing—more typical in hardware or driver failures.

---
# QUESTION 9

What is the primary difference between DNS spoofing and DNS poisoning?

✅ Spoofing uses false DNS requests, while poisoning manipulates cached records  
❌ Spoofing is a legal method of redirecting traffic, while poisoning is not  
❌ Spoofing targets only private networks, while poisoning targets public networks  
❌ Spoofing involves physical attacks on DNS servers, while poisoning does not  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Legal vs. illegal*: Neither is legal in practice—they're both attacks.
- ❌ *Private vs. public*: Both can target either; it's not network scope dependent.
- ❌ *Physical attacks*: Neither involves physically damaging hardware—both are logical attacks.

# QUESTION 10

Which of the following can be considered a rogue device?

✅ A wireless access point installed without IT approval  
❌ A company-issued laptop with up-to-date security software  
❌ A firewall configured by the network security team  
❌ An officially sanctioned DHCP server  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Company-issued laptop*: It’s managed, secured, and authorized—therefore not rogue.
- ❌ *Configured firewall*: A secured, sanctioned network component.
- ❌ *Sanctioned DHCP server*: By definition, not rogue if approved and deployed properly.
