## Rogue Devices and Services

- **Rogue device**: Not authorized by IT staff, often malicious.
- Examples: fake access point, rogue DHCP/DNS servers, spoofed PCs.
- Purpose: steal data like passwords or credit card numbers.
- **Shadow IT**: When users bring their own devices/software without approval. Creates unmonitored attack surfaces.

## Rogue DHCP

- **DHCP** auto-assigns IPs. If no lease, devices use APIPA (`169.254.x.x`).
- **Rogue DHCP server** can give bad IP settings: wrong gateway/DNS.
- Used to redirect traffic for MITM (on-path) attacks.

### ðŸ›‘ DHCP Starvation
- Sends tons of bogus requests to exhaust DHCP pool.
- Blocks real users from getting IPs.
- May push clients to accept lease from a rogue server.
