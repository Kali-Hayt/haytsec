## ‚úÖ Lab 9.4.8 ‚Äì Poison DNS

### üéØ Objective:
Simulate a DNS spoofing attack to redirect user traffic by performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack using Ettercap.

### üß™ Lab Tasks Summary

- ‚úÖ Scan for hosts in Ettercap  
- ‚úÖ Set Exec (192.168.0.30) as target and initiate DNS spoofing  
- ‚úÖ Confirm that Exec was redirected to spoofed website

- Go to **Hosts > Host list**
- Find **192.168.0.30**, select it
- Click **Add to Target 1**

#### 3. ‚ò†Ô∏è Initiate DNS Spoofing
- Go to **Plugins > Manage the plugins**
- Under **Plugins tab**, double-click **dns_spoof**
- Go to **Mitm > ARP poisoning**
- Enable **Sniff remote connections** ‚Üí Click **OK**

#### 4. üîç Confirm the Redirect on Exec
