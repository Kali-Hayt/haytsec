### 9.2.1 â€“ Threat Types and Assessment

#### ðŸ§± Threat Assessment  
- Involves identifying **threat sources** and profiling the **types** and **capabilities** of threat actors.  
- Exploits may be developed by attackers or triggered by weak processes.

#### ðŸ§± External vs Internal Threats  
- **External Threat**:  
  - Has no authorized access to the target system.  
  - Relies on **malware**, **social engineering**, or even **physical intrusion**.  
  - Can be remote or on-prem (e.g., breaking into HQ).  
  - Defined by origin, **not method**.  
- **Internal Threat (Insider)**:  
  - Has granted permissions.  
  - Usually employees, but also includes **contractors** or **partners**.  
  - Can misuse legitimate access intentionally or accidentally.

#### ðŸ§± Threat Research  
Counterintelligence effort aimed at understanding attacker **TTPs** (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).  
Three key research outputs:
- **Behavioral Threat Research**:  
  - Descriptive narratives of how attacks occur.  
  - Based on primary source research.  
- **Reputational Threat Intelligence**:  
  - Lists of malicious IPs, domains, file signatures.  
- **Threat Data**:  
  - Collected telemetry from systems.  
  - Correlated with known TTPs to identify actors.
