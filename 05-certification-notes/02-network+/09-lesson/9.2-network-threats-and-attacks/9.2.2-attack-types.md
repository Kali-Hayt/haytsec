## üß± Types of Attacks

### Footprinting and Fingerprinting

- **Footprinting** = information gathering about network layout, services, and vulnerabilities.
  - Example: social engineering (tricking users), dumpster diving, or port scanning.
  - Port scans identify open TCP/UDP ports.

- **Fingerprinting** = identifying OS types, versions, and service banners.
  - Involves analyzing how devices respond to network probes.
  - Servers often leak info in headers/banners (e.g., HTTP server reveals OS).

üîç Passive vs Active:
- Footprinting can be **passive** (dumpster diving) or **active** (port scans).
- Fingerprinting is usually **active** (OS detection based on response behavior).

### Spoofing Attacks

- **Spoofing** = falsifying identity or source data to appear trusted.
  - Can target **users** (phishing, pharming) or **protocols** (ARP, DNS).
  - Goal: trick system into misrouting or trusting malicious data.

Examples:
- Email spoofing, IP spoofing, DNS poisoning.
- Fake websites mimicking legitimate ones.

### Denial of Service (DoS)

- DoS = making a host or service unavailable by **overloading resources** or **exploiting flaws**.
- Can target:
  - **Hardware** (power, cabling)
  - **Software** (input validation flaws)
  - **Resources** (CPU, memory, bandwidth)

Types:
- **Resource exhaustion** ‚Äì flood a system till it crashes or slows.
- **Blinding attack** ‚Äì flood a log/alerting system to hide malicious activity.
- Can be a **precursor** to other attacks (like exfiltration or spoofing).

## üß± Insider vs External Threats

- **Insider threats** = have legitimate access (e.g., rogue employee).
- **External threats** = must breach perimeter first (e.g., malware injection).

Goals of adversaries:
- Exfiltrate data
- Misuse services (e.g., for fraud)
- Disrupt availability
