## ðŸ§ª Lab 9.3.8: Spoof MAC Addresses with SMAC

### Objective
Spoof MAC address on `ITAdmin` to match `Office2`.

### Steps
1. Find MAC + IP of `Office2`:  
   - MAC: `00:00:55:55:44:16`  
   - IP: `192.168.0.33`

2. Find MAC + IP of `ITAdmin`:  
   - MAC: `00:00:55:55:44:14`  
   - IP: `192.168.0.31`

3. Use **SMAC** on `ITAdmin` to spoof Office2â€™s MAC.
4. Run `ipconfig /renew` to refresh IP.

### Result
- âœ… Spoofing successful
- âœ… MAC and IP now match Office2
- âœ… 100% lab score

### Learning
- MAC spoofing can be used to impersonate a trusted device.
- Useful for red teaming, but also a major security risk if exploited maliciously.
