# QUESTION 1  
**What is the purpose of caching ARP results?**

- ❌ To increase the speed of the routing process  
- ❌ To increase the encryption level of data packets  
- ❌ To assign static IP addresses to devices  
- ✅ To reduce the amount of ARP traffic on the network  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Speed of routing process* — Routing is handled at Layer 3, while ARP is Layer 2. ARP caching reduces broadcasts, not routing delay.  
- ❌ *Encryption level* — ARP doesn't involve encryption at all; it's a clear-text protocol.  
- ❌ *Assign static IPs* — That's handled by manual config or DHCP reservations, not ARP.

# QUESTION 2  
**You manage a network that has multiple internal subnets. You connect a workstation to the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.  
This workstation cannot communicate with any other host on the network. You run `ipconfig /all` and see:**

- IP Address: 192.168.2.102  
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1  
- DNS: 192.168.2.20  

**What is the MOST likely cause of the problem?**

- ❌ Incorrect DNS server address  
- ✅ Incorrect IP address  
- ❌ Incorrect subnet mask  
- ❌ Incorrect default gateway  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Incorrect DNS server* — DNS affects name resolution, not basic network connectivity like pinging local devices.  
- ❌ *Subnet mask* — /24 (255.255.255.0) is correct for 192.168.1.0 subnet.  
- ❌ *Default gateway* — 192.168.1.1 is valid for that subnet.  

🔍 **The IP address is in the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet**, not 192.168.1.0/24 — this device is off-network.

# QUESTION 3  
**What is the purpose of the `ip -s link` command?**

- ❌ To configure firewall rules  
- ❌ To add or delete IP addresses  
- ❌ To enable or disable interfaces  
- ✅ To report interface statistics  

**Why the others are wrong:**
- ❌ *Firewall rules* — that’s the job of `iptables`, `nft`, or firewalld—not `ip link`.  
- ❌ *Add/delete IP addresses* — you’d use `ip addr add` or `ip addr del` for that.  
- ❌ *Enable/disable interfaces* — that’s done with `ip link set dev eth0 up/down`.  
- ✅ `ip -s link` reports traffic stats like RX/TX packets, errors, and drops per interface. It’s your Linux version of `netstat -i`.

🧱 Think of it like:  
`ip link` = interface management  
`ip -s link` = stats reporting on interfaces

# QUESTION 4  
**You are troubleshooting a connectivity problem on a Linux server... Which of the following would you use to view the default gateway information?**

- ❌ Telnet  
- ✅ route  
- ❌ ipconfig  
- ❌ dig  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Telnet* — It's used to test port connectivity, not view routing tables.  
- ❌ *ipconfig* — That's a Windows command. Linux uses `ip` or `ifconfig`.  
- ❌ *dig* — DNS lookup tool. It won’t show you gateway info.  
- ✅ *route* (or better: `ip route`) shows the current routing table including the default gateway.

🧱 Pro tip:  
Run `route -n` or `ip route show` on Linux to spot the gateway under `default via`.

# QUESTION 5  
**What does the TTL value in the ping command output indicate?**

- ❌ The packet's payload size  
- ❌ The encryption level of the packet  
- ✅ The number of hops it took for the packet to reach its destination  
- ❌ The speed of the network connection  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Payload size* is shown separately in ping, not related to TTL.  
- ❌ *Encryption level* isn't shown in ping output. Ping doesn't encrypt packets.  
- ✅ *TTL (Time to Live)* is a counter that decreases by 1 for each hop (router).  
- ❌ *Speed of connection* is shown by response time (ms), not TTL.

🧱 TTL is a hop limit — like a passport stamp for every router it touches.  
If it hits zero, the packet is dropped. 🔍 Useful for preventing loops.

# QUESTION 6  
**What is the difference between an ARP cache and a switch's MAC address table?**

✅ An ARP cache maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, while a MAC address table maps ports to MAC addresses.  
❌ An ARP cache encrypts data, while a MAC address table does not.  
❌ An ARP cache assigns IP addresses, while a MAC address table assigns MAC addresses.  
❌ An ARP cache is used by routers, while a MAC address table is used by switches.

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ *Encryption* has nothing to do with ARP or MAC tables — neither encrypts anything.  
- ❌ ARP doesn't *assign* IPs; DHCP does. MAC tables don't assign MACs either — they learn them.  
- ❌ *Routers* use ARP, yes, but so do PCs and servers. And MAC tables aren’t limited to switches; some routers/smart devices use them too.

🧱 ARP cache = "Who's who?" for IP-to-MAC  
🧱 MAC table = "Where to send this?" based on MAC-to-port

# QUESTION 7  
**A helpdesk technician is troubleshooting issues on a Windows client.  
Which command should the technician use to clear the current IP address so that a new one can be assigned?**

✅ **ipconfig /release**  
❌ ipconfig /all  
❌ ipconfig /renew  
❌ ipconfig /flushdns  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **ipconfig /all** just *displays* full IP configuration — it doesn’t change anything.  
- ❌ **ipconfig /renew** requests a new IP from the DHCP server, *but only after* one is released.  
- ❌ **ipconfig /flushdns** clears DNS cache, not IP settings — totally unrelated to IP leasing.

🧱 **/release** = "Let go of current IP"  
🧱 **/renew** = "Ask DHCP for new IP"  
Together:  
`cmd
ipconfig /release  
ipconfig /renew

# QUESTION 8  
**Which ping switch forces the tool to query the IPv6 host record?**

✅ **-6**  
❌ -c  
❌ -4  
❌ -t  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **-c** is used in *Linux* to set the number of echo requests (`ping -c 4 google.com`), not related to IPv6.  
- ❌ **-4** is the opposite of what’s asked — it forces **IPv4**, not IPv6.  
- ❌ **-t** in *Windows* means *"ping until manually stopped"*, not an address family selector.

🧱 Use `-6` to test IPv6 paths:  
`bash
ping -6 google.com

# QUESTION 9  
**What is the primary difference between dynamic learning and static configuration in network devices?**

✅ **Dynamic learning allows network devices to automatically learn and store MAC addresses, while static configuration requires manual entry of MAC addresses.**  
❌ Dynamic learning assigns IP addresses to devices, while static configuration is used for assigning MAC addresses.  
❌ Dynamic learning encrypts network traffic, while static configuration does not.  
❌ Static configuration allows for automatic updates to device firmware, while dynamic learning does not.  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **Dynamic learning assigns IPs** — incorrect. That’s DHCP. Dynamic learning refers to MAC address learning on switches.  
- ❌ **Encryption** — totally unrelated. Neither dynamic nor static config inherently encrypts traffic.  
- ❌ **Firmware updates** — not relevant here. Static vs dynamic MAC learning has nothing to do with firmware.

🧱 Think of dynamic learning like this:  
A switch watches traffic, learns MAC addresses as they come in, and builds a table on the fly. Static config means *you* manually assign which MAC belongs to which port.

# QUESTION 10  
**Which Windows TCP/IP utility gives an output of the results of four consecutive ICMP packets sent to a remote computer?**

✅ **ping**  
❌ ifconfig  
❌ ipconfig  
❌ arp -a  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- ❌ **ifconfig** — Linux/Unix tool. Not even valid on Windows.  
- ❌ **ipconfig** — Shows IP configuration info (like address, gateway, DNS), not ICMP tests.  
- ❌ **arp -a** — Displays the ARP table, not used for sending test packets.  

🧱 The `ping` command sends ICMP Echo Request packets and reports Echo Replies, giving you a basic reachability check and latency snapshot. Classic network troubleshooting move.
