## 4.4.7 Lab: Use IPv4 Test Tools  
**Tags**: #networking #lab #ipv4 #windows #linux #testing #troubleshooting  

### 🧪 Lab Goals
- Investigate Windows and Linux workstations' network configurations.
- Use `ipconfig`, `ip`, `ping`, and `traceroute` to test connectivity and trace paths.
- Compare routing behavior between platforms.

### ✅ Task Summary

**Q1: What is the IP address of Office1?**  
✅ 192.168.0.33  

**Q2: What is the default gateway?**  
✅ 192.168.0.5  

**Q3: Is Office1 using DHCP?**  
✅ Yes  

**Q4–Q6: Trace and compare routes to `rmksupplies.com`**  
✅ Used `tracert` (Windows) and `traceroute` (Linux) to map the path.  
✅ Compared number of hops and IP sequence between systems.

### 🧰 Tools Used

#### 🪟 Windows
- `ipconfig /all`: Displayed IP, gateway, and DHCP status.
- `ping 192.168.0.5`: Confirmed connectivity to the gateway.
- `tracert rmksupplies.com`: Revealed route taken to remote host.

#### 🐧 Linux
- `ip addr` and `ip route`: Viewed IP settings and default route.
- `ping 192.168.0.5`: Confirmed local connectivity.
- `traceroute rmksupplies.com`: Mapped route to destination.

---

### 🔍 Insights
- Both systems used the same gateway (192.168.0.5), showing consistent LAN routing.
- Hop count and path may differ slightly due to OS networking stacks, DNS behavior, or real-time path changes.
- `traceroute` helps visualize the actual route packets take—vital for troubleshooting, latency analysis, or spotting misrouted paths.

### 📌 Takeaway
Ping = “Is it up?”  
Traceroute = “How do I get there?”  
Both are simple, but critical tools for diagnosing network reachability and topology from any host.
