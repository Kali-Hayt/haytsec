## 4.3.2 Public vs Private Addressing

### 🌐 Public IP Address
- Assigned by **IANA** and administered by regional registries/ISPs.
- Globally **routable** on the Internet.
- Uniquely identifies devices across networks.
- Example use: Connecting a company web server to the public Internet.

### 🏠 Private IP Address
- Defined by **RFC 1918**.
- Reserved for use within private networks (not routable over the Internet).
- Can be reused across different private networks.
- Common for home, LAN, and enterprise internal networks.

#### 📦 Private Address Ranges
| Class | Range | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| A | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 | Large networks |
| B | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 | Medium networks |
| C | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | Small networks |

### 🌉 Internet Access from Private Networks
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):**
  - A router with one public IP translates between private and public addresses.
  - Allows multiple private devices to share a single public IP.
- **Proxy Server:**
  - Acts on behalf of internal clients.
  - The proxy uses a public IP; internal clients remain private.
