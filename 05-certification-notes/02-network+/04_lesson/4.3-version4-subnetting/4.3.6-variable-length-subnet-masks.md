## 4.3.6 – Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)

### 🧱 What is VLSM?
- **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)** is a classless addressing technique.
- It allows subnet masks of different lengths **within the same network**, enabling flexible IP address allocation.
- VLSM is often used in combination with **CIDR** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
- Goal: avoid IP wastage by customizing subnet sizes to the **actual number of required hosts**.

---

### ✅ Benefits of VLSM
- Supports **efficient IP address space use**.
- Eliminates unnecessary large subnets (e.g., avoids assigning /24 for a link that only needs 2 hosts).
- Reduces the number of wasted addresses.
- Reduces routing table size (fewer route entries).
- Matches IP planning to **real-world needs**, such as:
  - WAN point-to-point links (need 2 hosts ➝ /30)
  - Large offices (need 80+ hosts ➝ /25)
  - Medium sites (need ~30 hosts ➝ /27)

---

### 🛠️ Example Topology
- Company with three sites and WAN links:
  - **Main Office 1 (Router A):** 80 hosts
  - **Main Office 2 (Router A):** 30 hosts
  - **Main Office 3 (Router A):** 8 hosts
  - **Branch Office (Router B):** 12 hosts
  - **Branch Office (Router C):** 12 hosts
  - **WAN links:** 3 point-to-point links (2 IPs needed each)

### 📐 Bit & Prefix Calculations

| Hosts Needed | Nearest 2ⁿ Value | Host Bits | Prefix | Usable IPs |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 80           | 2⁷ = 128         | 7         | /25    | 126        |
| 30           | 2⁵ = 32          | 5         | /27    | 30         |
| 8, 12        | 2⁴ = 16          | 4         | /28    | 14         |
| 2 (WAN link) | 2² = 4           | 2         | /30    | 2          |

### 🧾 VLSM Address Plan Summary

| Office/Subnet              | Prefix | Subnet Mask       | Usable Range     | Broadcast |
|---------------------------|--------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Main Office 1 (Router A)  | /25    | 255.255.255.128    | 1–126            | 127       |
| Main Office 2 (Router A)  | /27    | 255.255.255.224    | 129–158          | 159       |
| Main Office 3 (Router A)  | /28    | 255.255.255.240    | 161–174          | 175       |
| Branch Office (Router B)  | /28    | 255.255.255.240    | 177–190          | 191       |
| Branch Office (Router C)  | /28    | 255.255.255.240    | 193–206          | 207       |
| Router A – Router B       | /30    | 255.255.255.252    | 209–210          | 211       |
| Router A – Router C       | /30    | 255.255.255.252    | 213–214          | 215       |
| Router B – Router C       | /30    | 255.255.255.252    | 217–218          | 219       |

📌 **Note:** The IPs are allocated consecutively, minimizing gaps. There were 36 spare addresses left, meaning Router A’s /27 could’ve been a /26.

### 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Subnets with higher host demand get larger address blocks.
- Point-to-point links use the most efficient /30.
- Only Main Office 2 has **no room for growth**; others do.
- VLSM improves routing **scalability** and IP efficiency.
