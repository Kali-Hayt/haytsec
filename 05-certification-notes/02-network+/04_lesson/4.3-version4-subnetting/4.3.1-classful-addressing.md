## 4.3.1 Classful Addressing

### 🧱 Overview

Before subnet masks and CIDR came along, IP addressing followed **classful addressing**, a system from the 1980s. In this system, the **first octet** of the IP address determined which class it belonged to — and that decided how many networks and hosts were allowed.

This method is now outdated, but the terminology is still used today in reference to default subnet masks.

### 📦 IP Address Classes

| Class | First Octet Range | Default Subnet Mask | # of Networks | Hosts per Network |
|-------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Class A** | `1 – 126` | `255.0.0.0` (`/8`) | 126 | 16,777,214 |
| **Class B** | `128 – 191` | `255.255.0.0` (`/16`) | 16,384 | 65,534 |
| **Class C** | `192 – 223` | `255.255.255.0` (`/24`) | 2,097,152 | 254 |

> 🔍 **Reserved Ranges:**
> - `0.0.0.0/8`: Reserved as "this" network.
> - `127.0.0.0/8`: Reserved for loopback (localhost).

### 🧱 Bit Patterns

Each class is defined by the **starting bits** of the first octet in binary:

- **Class A**: `0xxxxxxx` → 1–126
- **Class B**: `10xxxxxx` → 128–191
- **Class C**: `110xxxxx` → 192–223

### 🧠 Why It Matters Today

Even though **classless** routing and CIDR are standard today, the class labels still appear when referring to **default subnet masks**:

- **"Class A"** = `/8` = `255.0.0.0`
- **"Class B"** = `/16` = `255.255.0.0`
- **"Class C"** = `/24` = `255.255.255.0`

🧱 These are useful reference points when working with legacy systems or just communicating subnet sizes casually.

### ❌ Limitations of Classful Addressing

- Wastes IP space (e.g., Class A gives 16 million hosts even if you only need 100).
- Lacks flexibility — no room for subnetting or VLSM.
- Replaced by **CIDR** and **classless** systems in modern networking.

### ✅ Quick Class Check (First Octet)

| First Octet | Class |
|-------------|--------|
| 1–126       | A |
| 128–191     | B |
| 192–223     | C |
