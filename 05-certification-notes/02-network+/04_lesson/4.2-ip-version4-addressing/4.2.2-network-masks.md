## 4.2.2 – Network Masks

### 🧱 Purpose of a Network Mask
- A 32-bit **network mask (netmask)** separates the **network ID** from the **host ID** in an IPv4 address.
- The **mask hides the host portion** and reveals the network portion.
- Wherever the mask has a `1`, that bit in the IP is part of the **network**.
- Wherever the mask has a `0`, that bit in the IP is part of the **host**.

### 🧠 How it Works
- IP address and subnet mask are **bitwise ANDed**:
  - 1 AND 1 = 1 ✅ (keeps the bit)
  - 1 AND 0 = 0 ❌ (clears the bit)
- Example:
  - IP: `198.51.100.1` → `11000110.00110011.01100100.00000001`
  - Mask: `255.255.255.0` → `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`
  - AND result: `11000110.00110011.01100100.00000000` → `198.51.100.0`

---

### ✅ Valid Subnet Masks
- Must be **contiguous 1s followed by 0s**
- Examples:
  - Valid: `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000` (255.255.255.0)
  - ❌ Invalid: `11111111.00000000.11111111.00000000` (not contiguous)

---

### 🔎 Slash (CIDR) Notation
- CIDR = "Classless Inter-Domain Routing"
- Describes subnet masks by the **number of bits set to 1**.
- Example:
  - Mask: `255.255.255.0` → `/24`
  - Network: `198.51.100.0/24`

### 🎯 Default Subnet Masks
| CIDR | Subnet Mask     | Class | Hosts per Network |
|------|------------------|-------|--------------------|
| /8   | 255.0.0.0        | A     | 16 million         |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0      | B     | 65,534             |
| /24  | 255.255.255.0    | C     | 254                |

---

### 🧠 Summary Points
- Netmask tells routers what part of the address is the network vs host.
- Longer masks (e.g., `/24`, `/25`) = 🔐 more networks, fewer hosts.
- Shorter masks (e.g., `/8`, `/16`) = 🧩 fewer networks, more hosts.
- Use bitwise AND to calculate the **network address** from an IP and mask.

**Memorize key CIDRs:**

- `/8 = 255.0.0.0`
    
- `/16 = 255.255.0.0`
    
- `/24 = 255.255.255.0`
