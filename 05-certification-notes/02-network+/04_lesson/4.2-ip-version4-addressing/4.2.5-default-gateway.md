## 4.2.5 – Default Gateway

When a device wants to send an IPv4 packet, it checks whether the destination IP is **within the local subnet**. This decision is made by comparing:
- The **source IP**
- The **destination IP**
- The **subnet mask**

If the **network+subnet portion matches** for both source and destination → it's **local traffic** and is sent directly.

## 🔁 Local vs Remote Example

### ✅ Local delivery (matching subnet)
- SRC: `198.51.100.17`
- DST: `198.51.100.19`
- Subnet mask: `/28` = `255.255.255.240`
- Both addresses are in `198.51.100.16/28`
- ✅ Local delivery — no router needed

### ❌ Remote delivery (different subnet)
- SRC: `198.51.100.17` (`198.51.100.16/28`)
- DST: `198.51.100.49` (`198.51.100.48/28`)
- ⛔ Not in the same subnet
- Must be routed via **default gateway**

---

## 🚪 What Is a Default Gateway?

- A **default gateway** is the IP of a router interface on the local subnet
- It handles traffic destined for **outside the local network**
- Hosts forward non-local traffic to this IP

### 📦 Packet Flow

1. Host checks: *Is destination in my subnet?*
2. If **yes** → deliver directly (Layer 2 switch, ARP)
3. If **no** → send to **default gateway**
4. Router uses **routing table** to forward packet:
   - If route found: forward
   - If not: drop packet and send ICMP unreachable

---

## 🔍 Router Behavior

- Also compares source/destination IPs against subnet masks
- Makes forwarding decisions based on **routing table**
- Can learn paths via:
  - Static routes (manual)
  - Dynamic routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)

---

## 📌 Convention

> A router’s default gateway IP **can be any usable host address** in the subnet  
> ✅ Common practice: Use the **first** or **last usable IP**

Example in `198.51.100.16/28`:
- Network address: `198.51.100.16` ❌
- Broadcast address: `198.51.100.31` ❌
- Usable range: `198.51.100.17` – `198.51.100.30` ✅
- Common default gateway: `198.51.100.17` or `198.51.100.30`

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- Local traffic = same subnet = direct delivery
- Remote traffic = different subnet = route via default gateway
- Subnet mask is the deciding factor for routing
- Routers use routing tables to forward or drop traffic
