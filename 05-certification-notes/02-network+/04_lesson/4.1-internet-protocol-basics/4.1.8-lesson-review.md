# QUESTION 1

What is the function of the Protocol field in the IPv4 header?

❌ Indicates the version of Internet Protocol in use  
✅ Specifies the type of data encapsulated in the payload  
❌ Indicates the size of the header  
❌ Specifies the total packet size  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Indicates the version of Internet Protocol in use*: That’s done by the **Version** field, not the Protocol field.
- ❌ *Indicates the size of the header*: That’s the **IHL** (Internet Header Length) field's job.
- ❌ *Specifies the total packet size*: That’s handled by the **Total Length** field in the IPv4 header.

# QUESTION 2

Routing data between computers on a network requires several mappings between different addresses.  
Which of the following statements is true?

✅ Hosts use ARP to resolve known IP addresses into MAC addresses.  
❌ Routers use DNS to resolve MAC addresses of diskless workstations into IP addresses based on the information contained in other routers' routing tables.  
❌ ICMP lets routers bypass the general network broadcast by providing a dynamic table of IP-to-MAC address mappings.  
❌ Diskless workstations use ARP to ask a server for an IP address.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Routers use DNS...*: DNS resolves **domain names** to **IP addresses**, not MACs. Routers don’t use DNS to deal with MAC addresses.
- ❌ *ICMP lets routers...*: ICMP is used for diagnostic and control purposes (e.g., ping), not for IP-to-MAC resolution. ARP handles that.
- ❌ *Diskless workstations use ARP...*: They use **DHCP** to request an IP, not ARP. ARP works once the IP is already assigned.

# QUESTION 3

What is the primary difference between unicast and broadcast addressing?

✅ Unicast addressing sends data to a single recipient, while broadcast addressing sends data to all recipients within a network.  
❌ Unicast addressing sends data to all recipients within a network, while broadcast addressing sends data to a single recipient.  
❌ Unicast addressing uses the MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, while broadcast addressing uses individual MAC addresses.  
❌ Unicast addressing requires a special configuration on routers, while broadcast addressing does not.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Unicast sends to all recipients…*: That’s literally what **broadcast** does. Unicast is one-to-one.
- ❌ *Unicast uses ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff…*: That’s the **broadcast** MAC address, not unicast. Unicast uses unique MACs.
- ❌ *Unicast needs special router config…*: Unicast works by default. No special router config is needed just to send a packet to one device.

# QUESTION 4

Which type of address is the IP address 232.111.255.250?

✅ Multicast  
❌ Private  
❌ Broadcast  
❌ Unicast  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Private*: Private IPv4 ranges are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0/16. This IP isn’t in any of those.
- ❌ *Broadcast*: A broadcast IP typically ends in `.255` within a **local subnet**, like 192.168.1.255 in a /24 — 232.x.x.x isn’t broadcast.
- ❌ *Unicast*: Unicast uses addresses outside of the 224.0.0.0–239.255.255.255 range. This one (232.111.255.250) falls inside that = multicast.

🧠 Reminder:  
- Multicast IPv4 range = **224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255**

# QUESTION 5

Which of the following statements accurately describes the use of ARP messaging in network communication?

❌ ARP messaging is used with both Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.  
❌ ARP messaging is a protocol used to encrypt data packets before they are sent over Ethernet networks.  
✅ ARP messaging is exclusively used with Ethernet networks to resolve IPv4 addresses to hardware MAC addresses.  
❌ ARP messaging can be used with any type of network, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, to resolve domain names to IP addresses.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Ethernet and Wi-Fi?* — No. ARP is part of the Ethernet standard. Wi-Fi uses similar concepts, but **doesn’t use ARP directly**.
- ❌ *Encryption protocol?* — Nope. ARP is purely for **resolution**, not security.
- ❌ *Used for DNS?* — That’s **not** ARP’s job. **DNS** resolves domain names to **IP addresses**, not MACs.

✅ ARP was made for Ethernet LANs and IPv4:
- It links an IP address to a MAC address on **local subnetworks** only.

# QUESTION 6

What is the maximum theoretical size of an IPv4 packet?

❌ 1500 bits  
✅ 65,535 bytes  
❌ 1,500 bytes  
❌ 32 bits  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *1500 bits* — That's only **187.5 bytes**. Way too small. That’s not even the MTU.
- ❌ *1500 bytes* — That’s the typical **Ethernet MTU**, not the **IPv4 max packet** size.
- ❌ *32 bits* — That’s the size of an **IPv4 address**, not the whole packet.

🧱 IPv4 header has a **16-bit Total Length field**, so max size = 2¹⁶ - 1 = **65,535 bytes** (including header + data).

# QUESTION 7

What is the primary function of forwarding at Layer 3 in a network?

❌ Compressing data to save bandwidth  
✅ Routing packets based on IP addresses  
❌ Encrypting data for secure transmission  
❌ Switching frames based on MAC addresses  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Compression?* — That's more a **Layer 6 (Presentation)** or **application-level** function. Layer 3 does no such thing.
- ❌ *Encryption?* — That's handled at various layers, often **Layer 7 (App)** or **Layer 4 (TLS/IPsec)** — **not Layer 3's job**.
- ❌ *Switching frames?* — That’s **Layer 2** territory (MAC address-based switching). Layer 3 uses **IP addresses**, not MACs.

✅ Layer 3 = Routing  
- It’s all about **next-hop decisions** based on **IP addresses**, enabling communication between different subnets or networks.

# QUESTION 8

What role does a router play in a network with multiple subnets?

❌ It assigns MAC addresses to devices.  
❌ It encrypts data for all subnets.  
❌ It switches frames within a subnet.  
✅ It forwards packets between subnets.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Assigns MAC addresses* — That’s the job of the **NIC** (Network Interface Card) or maybe **DHCP for IPs**, not the router.
- ❌ *Encrypts data* — Routers don’t inherently encrypt. Encryption is usually done by **VPN gateways** or at the app level.
- ❌ *Switches frames* — That’s what **Layer 2 switches** do, using **MAC addresses** within a single subnet.

🧱 A router = **Layer 3 device**. It connects different subnets and forwards **IP packets** between them.

# QUESTION 9

In which scenario would a host use broadcast addressing?

❌ When establishing a secure connection with a single recipient.  
❌ When updating its own IP address.  
✅ When attempting to discover all hosts within its local network or subnet.  
❌ When sending a packet to a specific host outside its local network.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Secure connection with one recipient* — That’s classic **unicast**, like HTTPS or SSH.
- ❌ *Updating its own IP address* — That happens locally or through DHCP, not broadcast.
- ❌ *Sending to specific host outside local network* — That’s routed via a **default gateway**, again, **unicast**.

🧱 Broadcast = “Hey everyone on this subnet, listen up!”  
Used in:
- ARP (Who has 192.168.1.1?)
- DHCP Discover (I need an IP, anyone there?)

# QUESTION 10

Which of the following allows the same IP address to be assigned to multiple interfaces?

❌ Multicast  
❌ Broadcast  
❌ Unicast  
✅ Anycast  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Multicast* — Delivers to *many*, but uses a **multicast group** address, not shared across individual interfaces.
- ❌ *Broadcast* — Sends to *everyone* on the subnet, but the IP (like 255.255.255.255) isn't assigned to interfaces.
- ❌ *Unicast* — One-to-one. A single IP belongs to *one* interface.

✅ *Anycast* is the trickster:
- Same IP on *multiple* nodes
- Client gets routed to the *nearest* one (network-wise)
- Used in CDNs, DNS root servers, IPv6...

📍 Think of it as: “Same IP, but whichever responds fastest wins.”
