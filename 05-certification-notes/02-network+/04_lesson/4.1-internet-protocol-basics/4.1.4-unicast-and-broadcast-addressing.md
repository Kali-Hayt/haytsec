## 4.1.4 – Unicast and Broadcast Addressing

### 📥 Unicast Communication

- A **unicast** packet is addressed to a **single IP host**.
- It's the default form of communication on most networks.
- Common examples: browsing a website, sending a file, accessing a server.

> ✅ Unicast = one-to-one communication

---

### 📢 Broadcast Communication

- A **broadcast** packet is addressed to **all hosts** on the subnet.
- Sent using the **subnet's broadcast address** (the **last IP** in the subnet range).
- Every device on the same subnet receives and processes the packet.

> ✅ Broadcast = one-to-all communication (within the subnet)

---

### 🧠 Broadcast Domain & Delivery

- Hosts that share a broadcast address are in the same **Layer 3 broadcast domain**
- Routers **define the boundary** of the broadcast domain
- By default, **routers do not forward broadcasts**
- IP packets, including broadcasts, must still be delivered over Layer 2 using **MAC addresses**

#### 🔍 Layer 2 Delivery

- Layer 2 broadcasts use the **group MAC address**:
  ```
  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
  ```
- This forms a **Layer 2 broadcast domain**
- All nodes physically connected to a hub or unmanaged switch are in the same Layer 2 broadcast domain

---

### ⚙️ Legacy Devices & Switch Behavior

- **Hubs and bridges** forward broadcasts to all ports
- **Unmanaged switches** also flood broadcasts to all ports **except the source**
- This ensures every local device has a chance to respond (e.g., for ARP)

### 🧱 Summary Table

| Type      | Addressed To             | Scope                  | Layer      |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Unicast   | One specific IP + MAC     | One destination         | Layer 3 + 2|
| Broadcast | Broadcast IP + FF:FF...   | Entire subnet           | Layer 3 + 2|

> 🧠 Broadcasts are loud. Routers are the walls. Switches pass them around — unless you VLAN them out.
