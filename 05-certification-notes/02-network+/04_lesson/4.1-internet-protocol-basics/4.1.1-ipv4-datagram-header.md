## 4.1.1 ‚Äì IPv4 Datagram Header

### üß± Role of IPv4 at Layer 3

Ethernet operates at Layer 1 (Physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link) of the OSI model. These lower layers have no awareness of multiple networks or logical subdivisions. That function belongs to **Layer 3**, where the **Internet Protocol (IP)** steps in to provide **logical addressing and forwarding**.

### üß± IPv4 Header Function

The **IPv4 header** is a structured section that manages how packets are routed across networks. It includes key fields such as:

- **Source Address** (32-bit)
- **Destination Address** (32-bit)
- Various fields for fragmentation, routing, TTL, and data handling

### üß± IPv4 Header Structure (Fields Overview)

| Bits | Field Name         |
|------|--------------------|
| 0‚Äì3  | Version            |
| 4‚Äì7  | Header Length      |
| 8‚Äì15 | Differentiated Services (DiffServ) |
| 16‚Äì31| Total Length       |
|      | Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset |
|      | Time to Live (TTL), Protocol, Checksum |
|      | Source Address     |
|      | Destination Address|
|      | Options (optional) |
|      | Data (payload)     |

---

### üîç Key Field Explanations

- **Version**: Indicates IP version in use (IPv4 = 4).
- **Header/Total Length**: Packet size including payload (max 65,535 bytes).
- **TTL (Time to Live)**: Prevents endless looping‚Äîdecrements at each hop.
- **Protocol**: Identifies what‚Äôs encapsulated‚Äîe.g., TCP (6), UDP (17).

### ‚úÖ Common Protocol Type Values

| Protocol | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| ICMP     | 1     | Used for status/ping (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`) |
| IGMP     | 2     | Supports multicasting |
| GRE      | 47    | VPN tunneling (Generic Routing Encapsulation) |
| ESP/AH   | 50/51 | IPSec encryption/authentication |
| EIGRP/OSPF | 88/89 | Routing protocol for path selection |

### üß† Notes

- IPv4 headers vary in size due to **optional fields**.
- Most payloads are limited to ~1500 bytes due to MTU constraints on Ethernet.
- **Protocol field** is vital: tells the receiving host how to interpret the payload.
