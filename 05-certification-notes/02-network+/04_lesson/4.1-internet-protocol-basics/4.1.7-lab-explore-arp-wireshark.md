## 🧪 Lab: Explore ARP in Wireshark

### 🧱 ARP Protocol Basics

- ARP = Address Resolution Protocol  
- Used to map IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses (Layer 3 ➡️ Layer 2)
- Required before devices can communicate on a local subnet

**Analogy**:  
Think of IP addresses like apartment numbers and MAC addresses like people inside.  
ARP is the front desk clerk shouting, "Who lives in apartment 192.168.0.147?" so the postman (Ethernet) knows where to deliver.

### 🔎 Wireshark Lab Steps

1. **Start a 5-second packet capture** on `enp2s0` interface.
2. **Apply display filter** to show only ARP:
   ```
   arp
   ```
3. **Look for ARP Request** that says:
   ```
   Who has 192.168.0.x? Tell 192.168.0.y
   ```
   This is a broadcast from the source host asking for the MAC of the target.

4. Use the packet details pane to answer:
   - Who is asking?
   - What MAC address is it using?
   - Who are they asking about?
   - Was there a reply?

### 🎯 Targeted ARP Filter

To focus on requests about a **specific IP**, use:

```wireshark
arp.dst.proto_ipv4 == 192.168.0.147
```

This shows all packets **targeting** that IP.

### 🧠 ARP Behavior Recap

- **ARP Request** = Broadcast:  
  "Who has 192.168.0.147? Tell 192.168.0.193"

- **ARP Reply** = Unicast:  
  "192.168.0.147 is at 00:11:22:33:44:55"

- ARP only works within a **single broadcast domain** (same subnet)

### 🧪 ARP + Wireshark Pro Tips

- All ARP requests are broadcast (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`)
- Replies are unicast, directly back to the requester
- ARP is stateless — no handshake, no retry
- Use ARP to **discover devices** even without DNS
