## Module 22 â€“ SDN Basics

### ðŸ§± What is SDN?
- **Software-Defined Networking** = Controlling network devices through **software** instead of logging into each one manually.
- Separates **control plane** (decision-making) from **data plane** (actual packet forwarding).
- Managed centrally, usually by an SDN controller.

---

## SDN Architecture Layers

1. **Application Layer**
   - Apps that request network services (e.g., security policies, QoS rules).
2. **Control Layer** (Control Plane)
   - Centralized SDN controller.
   - Decides **where traffic should go**.
   - Communicates with devices via **Southbound APIs**.
3. **Infrastructure Layer** (Data Plane)
   - Physical/virtual switches & routers.
   - Forwards traffic based on instructions from the controller.

---

## Key Terms
- **Southbound API** â€“ Connects SDN controller to network devices.
  - Common example: **OpenFlow**.
- **Northbound API** â€“ Connects applications to SDN controller.
- **Centralized Management** â€“ All configs, policies, and updates pushed from one place.

---

## Benefits of SDN
- **Automation** â€“ Deploy new configs instantly to all devices.
- **Flexibility** â€“ Quickly adapt network paths & policies.
- **Programmability** â€“ Use code/scripts to manage network behavior.
- **Cost-Effective** â€“ Often runs on commodity hardware.

## SDN in the Real World
- **Cloud Data Centers** â€“ Dynamically allocate network resources.
- **WAN Optimization** â€“ SD-WAN is a popular SDN use case.
- **Security** â€“ Centralized ACLs & segmentation policies.

## Exam Pointers
âœ… Control plane = decision-making; data plane = packet forwarding.  
âœ… OpenFlow = common SDN protocol.  
âœ… Northbound = apps â†’ controller; Southbound = controller â†’ devices.  
âœ… Centralized control increases agility but can be a single point of failure if not redundant.
