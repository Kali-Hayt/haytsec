### 🧱 Lease Time and Lease Management

- **Lease renewal (T1 timer):** The client attempts to renew the lease after **50%** of its duration has passed, contacting the original DHCP server to retain its configuration.
- **Rebind (T2 timer):** If the renewal fails, at **87.5%** of the lease period, the client attempts to rebind with **any** available DHCP server to keep the configuration.
- If all else fails, the client releases the address and **starts over** (broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER again).

> ⚠️ If the network runs out of leases, short lease durations help free up unused addresses faster.  
> ⚙️ Windows uses `ipconfig /release`, and Linux typically uses `dhclient` or `systemd-networkd`.

### 🧱 DHCP Options

DHCP doesn’t just hand out IPs and subnet masks — it can push extra IP-related settings to clients, known as **DHCP Options**.

- Options are identified by **tag bytes** (decimal 1–254 only).
- Default options can be set server-wide, but **scope-specific** overrides are allowed.

#### Common DHCP Options:
- ✅ **Default Gateway** (router IP)
- ✅ **DNS Server addresses**
- ✅ **DNS domain suffix** (e.g., `corp.local`)
- ✅ **Time server (NTP)**, **file server (TFTP)**, **VoIP proxy**, etc.

🧠 These options streamline client setup — no need to manually configure each host!
