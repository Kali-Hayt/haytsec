# Lab 6.1.7: Explore Three-Way Handshake in Wireshark  
Tags: #lab #networking-plus #wireshark #tcp  

## ✅ Objective  
Understand and analyze the three-step TCP handshake in Wireshark by identifying key packets and their attributes.  

---

## 🧱 Setup Steps  
1. Open Wireshark.  
2. Select interface `enp2s0` from Capture options.  
3. Start the capture (blue fin icon).  
4. Wait ~5 seconds, then stop the capture (red square).

## 📦 Packet Analysis

### Q1: Which computer (IP address) is the sender of the [SYN] packet?  
**Your Answer:** `192.168.0.45`  
✅ **Correct**

### Q2: What is the value of the [SYN] flag in Wireshark?  
**Your Answer:** `0x002`  
✅ **Correct**

### Q3: Which computer is the sender of the [ACK, SYN] packet?  
**Your Answer:** `192.168.0.16`  
✅ **Correct**

### Q4: What is the destination port for the [ACK, SYN] packet?  
**Your Answer:** `5049`  
✅ **Correct**

### Q5: Which computer is the sender of the [ACK] packet?  
**Your Answer:** `192.168.0.45`  
✅ **Correct**

### Q6: What is the Acknowledgement number for the [ACK] packet?  
**Your Answer:** `2`  
✅ **Correct**

## 🧠 Notes

### 🔁 TCP 3-Way Handshake  
The handshake is a **3-step TCP connection setup**:

1. **SYN** — "Hey, I want to talk."  
2. **SYN-ACK** — "Okay, I'm listening. You good?"  
3. **ACK** — "Yep. Let's go."

### 🧱 TCP Flag Values  
- `0x002`: SYN  
- `0x012`: SYN + ACK  
- `0x010`: ACK  

> 🧩 The [SYN] packet **starts** the session, but the conversation isn’t **complete** until the [ACK] finishes the handshake.

### 🧪 What You Observed in Wireshark  
- TCP flag values in hexadecimal  
- Window size field  
- Source and destination ports  
- Sequence and Acknowledgment numbers  
- Raw hex + decoded packet header details
