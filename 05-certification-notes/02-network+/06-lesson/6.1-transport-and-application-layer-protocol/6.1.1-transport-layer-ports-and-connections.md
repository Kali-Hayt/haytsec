## 6.1.1 â€“ Transport Layer Ports and Connections

### ðŸ§± OSI Transport Layer (Layer 4)
- Focuses on **delivery** of multiplexed application data.
- Unlike lower layers (1â€“3), it doesnâ€™t care how data gets across the networkâ€”just how to manage delivery and verification.
- Protocols here include TCP and UDP.

### ðŸ”¢ Port Numbers
- Each application uses a **port number** to identify itself uniquely on a host.
- A single host can run **multiple services simultaneously**, each on its own port.
- Ports are essential for directing packets to the right service.

#### âœ… Port Ranges (Defined by IANA):
- **0â€“1023**: Well-known ports (e.g., HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443).
- **1024â€“49151**: Registered ports (used by vendors for specific services).
- **49152â€“65535**: Dynamic/private/ephemeral ports.
  - Used by clients to temporarily communicate with services.
  - Assigned as needed by OS.

> ðŸ“Ž Tip: Client ports = ephemeral/source ports.

### ðŸ”— Sockets & Connections
- A **socket** = combo of **IP address + port number**.
- Bound to a **software process** (e.g., a web server or browser).
- Only one process can bind to a socket at a time.
- **Connection =** Client socket â†” Server socket.
  - Uniquely defined by:  
    - `Server IP + Port`  
    - `Client IP + Port`
- Allows a server to manage **multiple connections** from different clients.
