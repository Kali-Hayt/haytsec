## 6.1.3 – TCP Handshake and Teardown

### 🤝 TCP Three-Way Handshake (Connection Establishment)

1. **SYN:** Client sends a TCP segment with the **SYN** flag and a random initial sequence number. → Enters **SYN-SENT** state.
2. **SYN-ACK:** Server (in **LISTEN** state) replies with a segment containing both **SYN** and **ACK** flags and its own sequence number. → Enters **SYN-RECEIVED** state.
3. **ACK:** Client acknowledges with an **ACK** segment. → Enters **ESTABLISHED** state.
4. **Connection established.** Server also enters the **ESTABLISHED** state.

> 🧱 Used for every TCP connection, even short ones (like single-file HTTP requests).
> 📎 TCP flags involved: `SYN`, `ACK`.

### 🧨 TCP Connection Teardown (Graceful Shutdown)

1. Client sends **FIN** → enters **FIN-WAIT1**.
2. Server responds with **ACK** → enters **CLOSE-WAIT**.
3. Server sends its own **FIN** → client enters **FIN-WAIT2**, server enters **LAST-ACK**.
4. Client replies with final **ACK** → enters **TIME-WAIT**, waits for timeout.
5. Server receives ACK → closes connection.

> ⚠ Some implementations simplify this to a 3-step FIN-ACK process.

### 🧹 RST – Abrupt Reset
- A host can terminate a TCP session immediately using **RST**.
- Common causes:
  - App/service crash
  - Security appliance blocking traffic
  - Suspicious activity like scanning

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- TCP tracks connection **state** at both endpoints.
- TCP is **reliable** but slower due to overhead from handshakes, ACKs, and retransmissions.
- If an ACK isn’t received in time, data is **resent automatically**.
- Use `netstat -ano` to inspect **active TCP connections** and states like:
  - LISTENING
  - ESTABLISHED
  - TIME-WAIT
  - CLOSE-WAIT
