## 🧠 Notes

- **Port 5900** is the default for **VNC (Virtual Network Computing)**.
- `netstat -l` shows **listening** ports only.
- `dnf` is the package manager for Fedora-based systems.
- Closing a port doesn't mean it's *blocked*—just that nothing is listening on it anymore.
- `nmap` shows **which hosts have specific ports open**—perfect for security sweeps.
