## 6.1.2 â€“ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

### âœ… Overview
- **TCP = connection-oriented** protocol at the **Transport layer (Layer 4)**.
- Guarantees delivery using **acknowledgments** and **retransmission**.
- Works only with **unicast** transmission (one-to-one).
- Splits application data into **segments**, adds headers, and sends reliably.

### ðŸ§± TCP Segment Fields

| Field              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Source port**         | TCP port of the sending host. |
| **Destination port**    | TCP port of the destination host. |
| **Sequence number**     | ID of current segment; allows reordering and error recovery. |
| **Acknowledgment number** | Indicates which segment the receiver expects next (last received +1). |
| **Data length**         | Length of the TCP segmentâ€™s payload. |
| **Flags**               | Control info (e.g., ACK, SYN, FIN) to manage connection state. |
| **Window**              | Amount of data host is willing to receive before requiring an ACK. |
| **Checksum**            | Verifies the integrity of the segment (includes parts of IP header too). |
| **Urgent pointer**      | Marks the end of urgent data (if used). |
| **Options**             | Allows settings like **Maximum Segment Size (MSS)** to reduce fragmentation. |

### ðŸ§  Key Points
- TCP is **reliable**, **ordered**, and **stateful**.
- Uses **3-way handshake** and **flow control**.
- Packets out of order? TCP reorders and confirms.
- Sluggish or overloaded? Window size can shrink to control flow.
