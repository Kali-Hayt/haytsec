#networking-plus #lab-notes #apipa #dhcp #ipv4 #ping-test  #lab

### ‚úÖ Lab Overview  
This lab explores how systems behave when using **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)** and what changes when **DHCP is enabled**.

---

### üìã Objectives
- Identify IP addresses assigned with and without DHCP  
- Test ping reachability between devices  
- Observe communication limitations with APIPA  
- Enable DHCP and verify behavior change

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Devices & IP Behavior

| Device     | Initial IP           | After DHCP Enabled   | Subnet     | Gateway Reachable? | Notes                          |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Exec       | 192.168.0.62         | (Static or DHCP)      | /24        | ‚úÖ Yes              | Can ping gateway only  
| Office1    | APIPA (169.254.x.x)  | ‚Üí 192.168.0.x         | /24        | ‚úÖ After DHCP       | Switched from APIPA ‚Üí DHCP  
| Office2    | APIPA (169.254.x.x)  | No change             | /16        | ‚ùå                  | Could ping Office1 only

### üîÑ Ping Results Summary

| Source    | Pinged Device | Result     | Reason                                |
|-----------|----------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Exec      | Gateway        | ‚úÖ Success | Same subnet  
| Exec      | Office1/2      | ‚ùå Fail    | Office1/2 were on APIPA initially  
| Office1   | Office2        | ‚úÖ Success | Both were using APIPA  
| Office2   | Office1        | ‚úÖ Success | APIPA allows local link communication  
| Office1   | Gateway        | ‚úÖ After DHCP | Gained IP in gateway's subnet  

---

### üß† Key Lessons

- **APIPA = 169.254.x.x** ‚Üí only local link comms  
- **DHCP = 192.168.x.x** ‚Üí full subnet/gateway communication  
- **APIPA devices can talk to each other**, but not to devices in other IP ranges  
- Default gateway cannot be assigned through APIPA

---

### üíª Commands Used

```bash
ipconfig
ping 192.168.0.5        # Ping the gateway
ping <DeviceName>       # Test connectivity between hosts
