## 6.3.3 – DHCPv6 Server Configuration   

---

### ✅ How DHCPv6 Differs from DHCPv4

In IPv6, **Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)** often handles most of the IP configuration. DHCPv6 isn’t always responsible for giving out full IP addresses — instead, it’s often used to provide **optional config info** like DNS, NTP, or domain names.

🧱 Unlike IPv4:
- **No broadcast** → Uses **multicast** (`ff02::1:2`)
- **Different ports**:
  - Port **546** = Client
  - Port **547** = Server
- **Default gateway** is **not set by DHCPv6** — it comes from **Router Advertisements (RA)**

---

### 🧪 DHCPv6 Modes

#### **Stateless Mode**
- Used **alongside SLAAC**
- Host gets:
  - IP and default gateway from **RA**
  - Additional info (DNS, domain) from **DHCPv6**
- Host sends **RS (Router Solicitation)** → Router replies with **RA**
- Router sets flags to inform client that DHCPv6 is available for extra config

#### **Stateful Mode**
- DHCPv6 **assigns a routable IP** to the host (like DHCPv4)
- Also gives DNS, suffixes, time server, etc.
- Still relies on **RA** for prefix and gateway info

### 📡 DHCPv6 Discovery Process

- Clients use **multicast** to find DHCPv6 servers: `ff02::1:2`
- Server responds, and assignment proceeds
- Scope must define:
  - Prefix
  - Available IP pool
  - Excluded ranges

🧱 Note: You **cannot assign a default route** via DHCPv6 — that comes only from Router Advertisement.

### 📝 Summary Table

| Feature                      | DHCPv4        | DHCPv6 Stateless      | DHCPv6 Stateful      |
|-----------------------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| IP address assignment       | Yes           | No (uses SLAAC)        | Yes                  |
| Default gateway provided    | Yes           | ❌ (RA only)           | ❌ (RA only)          |
| DNS info                    | Yes           | Yes                    | Yes                  |
| Discovery method            | Broadcast     | Multicast (`ff02::1:2`)| Multicast             |
| Ports                       | 67/68         | 546 (client), 547 (server) | Same              |

### Exam Tip 🔍

> DHCPv6 doesn’t replace SLAAC — it complements it.  
> If you see `ff02::1:2` and ports 546/547 — think **DHCPv6 in IPv6 world**, **not broadcast like v4**.
