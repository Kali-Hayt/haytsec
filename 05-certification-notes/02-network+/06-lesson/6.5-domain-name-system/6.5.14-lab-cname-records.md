## 6.5.14 – Lab: Create CNAME Records

### 🎯 Objective

Create three **CNAME (Alias)** records in the `sales.private` DNS zone so that internal users can access the intranet website hosted on `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local` using:

- `http://sales.private`
- `http://intranet.sales.private`
- `http://www.sales.private`

---

### 🧱 DNS Server Setup

**Server to use:** `CorpDC`  
**Zone to modify:** `sales.private`  
**DNS Tool:** Server Manager → Tools → DNS

---

### ✅ Required Records

| Alias Name   | FQDN Created                  | Target Host (FQDN)         |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| *(blank)*    | `sales.private`               | `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local`    |
| `intranet`   | `intranet.sales.private`      | `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local`    |
| `www`        | `www.sales.private`           | `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local`    |

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- CNAME records point **one domain name to another**.
- Creating a blank alias name means you're aliasing the **zone root**.
- The **target host** must be a valid FQDN already resolvable by DNS.
- This lab had **nothing to do with IIS bindings**—pure DNS configuration.

---

### 🧨 What Went Wrong Initially

- I tried to configure bindings in IIS on `CorpWeb` instead of creating DNS records on `CorpDC`.
- I misunderstood the lab as involving host headers or site bindings, when it only required DNS aliasing.
- I didn't initially realize the **Alias name field** should be left **blank** for `sales.private`.

---

### ✅ How I Fixed It

1. Opened **DNS Manager** on `CorpDC`
2. Navigated to **Forward Lookup Zones > sales.private**
3. Right-clicked the zone → **New Alias (CNAME)**
4. Created each alias:
   - **Blank** alias → `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local`
   - `intranet` alias → `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local`
   - `www` alias → `CorpWeb.CorpNet.local`
5. Confirmed resolution works using `ping` or `nslookup`

### 🏁 Result

✅ **Score: 100%**  
📚 **Lesson learned:** Always start at the DNS server when working with record creation—even if the hostname relates to a web server.
