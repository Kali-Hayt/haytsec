## 6.5.6 Mail Exchange, Service, and Text Records  
#networking-plus

### üì¨ MX (Mail Exchange) Records
- Used to identify an email server for a domain.
- A domain can have **multiple MX records** for redundancy.
- **Priority value**: Lower number = higher priority.
- Each MX must point to a host with an A or AAAA record.
- ‚ùå Cannot point to a CNAME.

### üõ†Ô∏è SRV (Service) Records
- Maps a **service + protocol + domain** to a **hostname + port**.
- Example: Used by VoIP systems, Microsoft Active Directory (e.g., locating domain controllers).
- Format includes:
  - **Priority** (like MX, lower = preferred)
  - **Weight** (for balancing among equal-priority records)
  - **Port**
  - **Target host**

### üìù TXT (Text) Records
- Stores **free-form text**, mostly for email security.
- Common uses:
  - **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Lists IPs allowed to send mail on behalf of domain.
  - **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Adds cryptographic signatures to verify sender.
- Can contain other metadata for verification or admin purposes.

## üß± Example SRV record
_gc._tcp.dc._msdcs.corp.515support.com.  
[Priority][Weight][Port] TargetHost  
[0] [100] [3268] dc10.corp.515support.com.

## üß± Example TXT record (SPF)
"v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 include:_spf.google.com ~all"

## üîç Extra Notes
- **MX** and **SRV** records often work together with A/AAAA records to complete resolution.
- DNS must not allow CNAMEs in place of MX targets ‚Äî it breaks resolution.
- Multiple TXT records can exist, but be careful ‚Äî some services merge them incorrectly.
- DNS admins can configure **dynamic DNS (DDNS)** to update host records automatically.
