---

### 🧱 Lab Steps Breakdown

#### 1. Add the DHCP Relay Agent Protocol
- Go to: **Server Manager > Tools > Routing and Remote Access**
- Expand **IPv4**
- Right-click **General** > select **New Routing Protocol**
- Choose **DHCP Relay Agent** → click **OK**

#### 2. Add & Configure the Relay Agent Interface
- Right-click **DHCP Relay Agent** > select **New Interface**
- Choose interface: **NetTeam**
- Confirm: ✅ *Relay DHCP packets*
- Set **boot threshold** to `0`
- Click **OK**

#### 🔍 What’s `boot threshold = 0`?
> Tells the relay agent to **start forwarding DHCP requests immediately after boot**.
> No delay. No hesitation. As soon as the interface is up, it's listening and relaying.

Use case: Perfect when the network is fast, stable, and you want rapid DHCP availability.
