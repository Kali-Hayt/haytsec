# 🧵 T568A and T568B Termination Standards (2.3.2)

Ethernet cables must be **terminated properly** to function. There are two standard wiring schemes used for twisted-pair Ethernet cabling:

- **T568A**
- **T568B**

Both are defined by the **ANSI/TIA/EIA 568** commercial building wiring standard.

---

## 🧰 Termination Rules

- **Patch cords** → use **RJ45 plugs**
- **Structured cabling** (in walls, ceilings) → use **IDCs (Insulation Displacement Connectors)**

> ⚠️ Always use the **same standard** on both ends of a cable to avoid signal issues.

---

## 🎨 Color Coding of Twisted Pairs

Each twisted-pair cable contains **4 pairs** (8 wires total), color-coded as follows:

- **Green**
- **Orange**
- **Blue**
- **Brown**

Each pair:
- One wire has **white with color stripe**
- One wire has **solid color**

## 🔀 Key Differences Between T568A and T568B

| Pair Color   | T568A Pins | T568B Pins |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Green        | 1 & 2      | 3 & 6      |
| Orange       | 3 & 6      | 1 & 2      |
| Blue         | 4 & 5      | 4 & 5      |
| Brown        | 7 & 8      | 7 & 8      |

- **T568A** starts with the **green** pair
- **T568B** starts with the **orange** pair
- **T568B is more common** in commercial installations

| 2   | Green            | Orange           | Tx−         | BixA−         |
| 3   | Orange/White     | Green/White      | Rx+         | BixB+         |
| 4   | Blue             | Blue             | —           | BixC+         |
| 5   | Blue/White       | Blue/White       | —           | BixC−         |
| 6   | Orange           | Green            | Rx−         | BixB−         |
| 7   | Brown/White      | Brown/White      | —           | BixD+         |
| 8   | Brown            | Brown            | —           | BixD−         |

## ⚠️ Mixing A & B = Crossover Cable

- Using **T568A on one end** and **T568B on the other** creates a **crossover cable**.
- This is useful for **device-to-device** connections (e.g., PC ↔ PC), but **not for infrastructure**.

> ✅ Use **T568B consistently** unless you're required to use T568A (e.g., government or military contracts).

---

## 🧊 Special Note on Cat 7 & Cat 8

> Cat 7 and Cat 8 cables are so sensitive to noise that the secondary wire in each pair is **solid white with no stripe**. Adding color would reduce insulation effectiveness.
