# üì¶ 2.3.1 ‚Äì Structured Cabling System

Structured cabling is a **standardized method** of installing and managing network cabling in buildings. The goal? **Consistency**, **scalability**, and **ease of maintenance**.

The **ANSI/TIA/EIA-568** standard defines six main subsystems or components of structured cabling.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº 1. Work Area
- This is **where the end-user connects**.
- Includes network jacks (wall outlets) and patch cables that link to computers, phones, etc.
- Example: The Ethernet cable from your PC to the wall port.

---

## üìè 2. Horizontal Cabling
- Connects the **Work Area** to the **IDF** (Intermediate Distribution Frame).
- Cabling typically runs through **walls, ceilings, or floor ducts**‚Äî**horizontally** on the same floor.
- Max length: **90 meters (295 feet)** for copper cabling.
- If longer, install additional IDFs.
- Uses:
  - **Cat 5e / 6 / 6a** UTP/STP
  - Occasionally fiber for high-speed setups
- This includes: 
  - The cable run
  - Wall plates
  - Connectors and patch panels

---

## üß∞ 3. Telecommunications Room (TR)
- Also called the **IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame)**.
- Houses:
  - Patch panels
  - Switches
  - Routers
- It's the **handoff point** between horizontal cabling and the backbone.
- Must be:
  - **Secure** (lockable room or closet)
  - **Well-ventilated**
- Not a storage closet!

---

## üîó 4. Backbone Cabling (Vertical Cabling)
- Connects **IDFs to the MDF** (Main Distribution Frame).
- Typically runs **between floors** (vertical).
- Carries all network data between TRs (IDFs).
- Cables used:
  - **Fiber optic** (most common)
  - **High-grade copper** (STP or coax, but expensive and less common today)
- Handles **high bandwidth**, **long distance**.

---

## üßØ 5. Main Distribution Frame (MDF)
- The **core** of the network.
- Central connection point for **all IDFs** and **external networks** (e.g., ISP connection).
- Located in a secure, controlled environment.
- Connects:
  - Backbone cabling
  - Internet service
  - Servers, firewalls, core switches

---

## üåê 6. Entrance Facilities / Demarc
- Where **external cabling** enters the building.
- Connects to:
  - The local telco
  - ISP
  - Other buildings
- Marks the **demarcation point**‚Äîwhere the provider‚Äôs responsibility ends and yours begins.
- Often located near the MDF.

## üßµ Summary Table

| Component              | Function                                                  | Example                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Work Area              | Connects user devices to wall ports                       | Office PC Ethernet cable                  |
| Horizontal Cabling     | Connects work areas to IDF                                | Cat6 in ceilings between office & closet  |
| Telecommunications Room| Hosts IDF gear like switches and patch panels             | Network closet on floor 2                 |
| Backbone Cabling       | Links IDFs to MDF (vertical paths)                        | Fiber from floor 1 to floor 3             |
| Main Distribution Frame| Core switch, connects to ISP and all IDFs                | Server room with router, firewall         |
| Entrance Facilities    | Building‚Äôs connection to outside world (ISP/telco)        | Telco handoff panel, coax/fiber entry     |

## üß† Key Notes
- **Fiber preferred for backbone**, especially for distance and EMI resistance.
- **Copper (Cat 5e/6)** usually used for horizontal.
- Cabling should follow fire ratings:
  - **Plenum**: Air ducts
  - **Riser**: Between floors
- Label EVERYTHING. Neat cabling is maintainable cabling.
