# üõ†Ô∏è 2.3.4 ‚Äì Structured Cable Installation

## üîå Pulling Cable

Structured cabling is typically installed from a bulk spool and **pulled carefully** from the **telecommunications closet (TR)** to the **work area**.

- Routed through **wall conduits** or **ceiling spaces**
- Avoid **bends** and **electrical cables** (like fluorescent lights ‚Äì they cause interference)
- üìè **Max cable length**: `90 meters (295 feet)` for solid core cable
- Use **stranded patch cables** for short runs (max `5m` each, `10m` total)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è *Stranded cable has higher attenuation than solid cable*

## üè∑Ô∏è Labeling and Running Drops

> The process is also known as **dropping cable**

1. Start at the **patch panel**
2. Label the cable with a **jack ID**
3. Run the cable through wall/ceiling cavities to the work area
4. Group similar runs and **pull them together**
5. Leave **service loops** (extra slack) at both ends
6. Cut and **label both ends** clearly for future identification

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Tools for Cutting and Stripping

- **Electrician‚Äôs scissors (snips)**: for copper wire and jacket cutting  
- **Cable stripper**: for cutting insulation with **replaceable blades**
- Blades should be **rounded** to preserve cable geometry
- Stripper must **score** the jacket without nicking the inner wire insulation

‚úÖ **Tip**: Always follow cable ID standards and plan routes ahead. You only want to pull once ‚Äî clean and correct the first time.
