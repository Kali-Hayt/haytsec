## ðŸ”— 2.4.6 â€” Multi-Fiber Push On Connectors

**Multi-Fiber Push-On (MPO)** connectors are designed for **high-density backbone** or **trunk cabling**, where space and efficiency are critical. 

### ðŸ§µ Key Features

- An **MPO ribbon cable** bundles **12 or more strands** into a single compact ferrule.
- These cables are **prefabricated**, not meant for field termination.
- Available for both **MMF** and **SMF** fiber types.

### âš¡ Performance and Use Cases

- MPOs are used to aggregate multiple data lanes (e.g., 10 Gbps or 25 Gbps) into a **parallel link**:
  - Example: 4 lanes Ã— 10 Gbps = **40 Gbps**, using **8 strands** (Tx/Rx per lane).
- MPO supports high-speed standards like:
  - **40 Gbps**
  - **100 Gbps**
  - **400 Gbps**

### ðŸ”„ Efficiency

- MPO replaces multiple LC connectors with a **single, compact connection**.
- An MPO carrying **24 or 32 fibers** fits within the **same footprint as a duplex LC** connector.

This design is especially valuable in modern data centers where **port density and high-speed aggregation** are essential.
