## 🌈 2.4.7 — Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)

**Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)** is a technique that allows **multiple signals** to be transmitted over a **single fiber strand** by using different light wavelengths (colors) for each signal.

### 🔁 Transmission Types

- **Duplex Fiber**: Uses two strands — one for **transmit (Tx)** and one for **receive (Rx)**.
- **Parallel Fiber**: Uses **multiple strands** (8 to 20) to bundle lanes working at 10 Gbps or 25 Gbps for high-speed links like **40 Gbps or 100 Gbps**.

### 🔄 Bidirectional WDM (BiDi)

- Uses **one strand** for both Tx and Rx.
- Signals use **slightly different wavelengths**:
  - e.g., **1310 nm** for Tx and **1490 nm** for Rx.
- Requires **opposite pairing**: the far-end transceiver must reverse the wavelengths.
- Standards: **1000BASE-BX**, **10GBASE-BX**.

### ⚙️ CWDM vs DWDM

#### Coarse WDM (CWDM)
- Supports up to **16 wavelengths**.
- Typically used for **4 or 8 bidirectional channels**.
- Can work over:
  - A **single strand** (multiplexed bidirectionally)
  - Or **dual strands** (Tx/Rx split).
- **Less expensive**, but **less dense**.

#### Dense WDM (DWDM)
- Supports up to **160 channels** (e.g., 20, 40, 80, 160).
- Requires **precise lasers** and **tight wavelength spacing**.
- Higher cost but much **greater capacity**.
- Ideal for **multi-channel 1G, 10G, 40G** Ethernet.

🔧 **Important**: CWDM and DWDM must also be installed in **matched pairs**, just like BiDi systems.

**Bottom Line**:  
WDM is a power move when bandwidth needs to scale without pulling more fiber. It turns one strand into a whole highway of signals, whether you're going coarse and affordable or dense and powerful.
