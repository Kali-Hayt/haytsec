## üîç 2.4.2 ‚Äî Single Mode Fiber and Multimode Fiber

Fiber optic cables are categorized by **mode** (how light travels through the fiber), **material** (glass or plastic), and **core/cladding size** (measured in microns).

### üß† Single Mode Fiber (SMF)

- **Core size**: Very small (8‚Äì10 microns).
- **Light source**: Laser-generated light (wavelengths ~1310 nm or 1550 nm).
- **Performance**: Supports long distances (many kilometers) and very high speeds (up to 100 Gbps).
- **Use cases**: Ideal for **long-range** backbone links (WANs, metropolitan networks).
- **Grades**:
  - **OS1**: Indoor-rated.
  - **OS2**: Outdoor-rated.

### üß† Multimode Fiber (MMF)

- **Core size**: Larger (50 or 62.5 microns).
- **Light source**: LEDs (850 nm or 1300 nm).
- **Performance**: Shorter distances, multiple light paths (modes), lower cost optics.
- **Use cases**: Preferred for **short-range LAN** connections (e.g., inside data centers).
- **Limitation**: Doesn‚Äôt scale to high speeds or long distances like SMF.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: SMF optics used to be much more expensive, but the cost difference is now minimal. SMF provides better support for high-speed Ethernet (40 Gbps/100 Gbps).

### üìè MMF Cable Ratings

- **OM1/OM2**:
  - Core: 62.5 micron (OM1) or 50 micron (OM2).
  - Used with **LEDs**.
  - Rated for speeds up to **1 Gbps**.
  
- **OM3/OM4**:
  - Core: 50 micron.
  - Designed for **VCSEL (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser)**.
  - Known as **LOMMF** (Laser-Optimized MMF).
  - Better performance than LED-based MMF due to higher modulation speed.

These mode distinctions are crucial when selecting fiber for a given installation ‚Äî mismatching mode, core size, or optics leads to poor performance or complete link failure.
