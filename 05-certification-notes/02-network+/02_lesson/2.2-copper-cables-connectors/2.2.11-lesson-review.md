**Question 1**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following are true characteristics of RJ45 connectors? (Select two.)  
- ✅ They support up to 8 positions and 8 contacts.  
- ☐ They are primarily used for telephone systems.  
- ☐ They are designed for use with single-pair copper cables.  
- ✅ They have a plastic retaining clip.  
- ☐ They are identical in form to RJ11 connectors.  

**Explanation:**  
RJ45 connectors are designed for Ethernet and use 8P8C (8 positions, 8 contacts).  
They include a plastic retaining clip that secures the connector in the port.  
RJ11 is smaller and used for telephones—not interchangeable.

**Question 2**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which type of conductor wire is typically used for cables that run behind walls or through ducts?  
- ☐ Coaxial  
- ☐ Stranded  
- ☐ Fiber optic  
- ✅ Solid  

**Explanation:**  
Solid conductor wire is less flexible but more durable and stable, making it ideal for permanent installations behind walls and in ducts. Stranded wire is used where flexibility is needed, like in patch cables.

**Question 3**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** In a telephone system, what is the primary function of the center two contacts in an RJ11 connector?  
- ☐ They are used to provide power to the telephone unit.  
- ☐ They enhance the signal quality for internet connections.  
- ☐ They are reserved for future technological advancements.  
- ✅ They carry the dial tone and voice circuit.  

**Explanation:**  
The center two contacts in an RJ11 connector are wired to the "tip" and "ring" lines, which carry the dial tone and voice signals in traditional telephone systems.

**Question 4**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following is a typical use of twinaxial cables?  
- ☐ Residential telephone wiring  
- ☐ Outdoor lighting systems  
- ✅ Data center interconnects  
- ☐ Automotive audio systems  

**Explanation:**  
Twinaxial cables are used primarily in data centers for high-speed interconnects, such as 10/40 GbE links between servers, switches, and storage devices. They offer short-distance, high-bandwidth communication with reduced electromagnetic interference.

**Question 5**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of plenum-rated cables in place of riser-rated cables?  
- ✅ Plenum-rated cables can be used in place of riser-rated cables, but not vice versa.  
- ☐ Riser-rated and plenum-rated cables are interchangeable with no restrictions.  
- ☐ Using plenum-rated cables in place of riser-rated cables reduces the overall bandwidth of the network.  
- ☐ Plenum-rated cables can never be used in place of riser-rated cables due to their different fire safety standards.  

**Explanation:**  
Plenum-rated cables meet stricter fire safety standards and can be safely used in both plenum and riser spaces. Riser-rated cables, however, do not meet the higher fire safety requirements of plenum spaces and are not allowed as substitutes.

**Question 6**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** You're adding new wires in your building for some new offices. The building has a false ceiling that holds the lights and provides an air path for heating and air conditioning. You'd like to run your Ethernet cables in this area.  
Which type of cable must you use?  
- ☐ Fiber optic cables  
- ✅ Plenum-rated cable  
- ☐ STP cables  
- ☐ Cat 5e or Cat 6a cables  

**Explanation:**  
When running cables through a plenum space (like a false ceiling used for HVAC air flow), fire safety codes require the use of **plenum-rated cable**. These cables are made with special insulation that resists fire and produces less smoke if burned.

**Question 7**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following are typical uses of RG-59 coax cable?  
- ☐ In-vehicle networking  
- ☐ High-speed internet connections  
- ✅ Closed circuit TV (CCTV)  
- ☐ Long-distance telecommunication  
- ✅ Audio/video applications  

**Explanation:**  
RG-59 coaxial cable is thinner and more flexible than RG-6, making it suitable for **short-distance video** transmissions like **CCTV** and **A/V setups**. It's not ideal for high-speed internet or long-distance telecom due to higher signal loss.

---
**Question 8**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which organizations have created categories of cable standards for twisted pair to simplify the selection of a suitable quality cable?  
- ✅ ANSI and TIA/EIA  
- ☐ ISO and IEC  
- ☐ ITU and ETSI  
- ☐ IEEE and IETF  

**Explanation:**  
**ANSI** (American National Standards Institute) and **TIA/EIA** (Telecommunications Industry Association / Electronic Industries Alliance) define the **category ratings (Cat 5e, Cat 6, etc.)** used for twisted-pair cabling in structured networks. These standards help ensure consistent performance.

**Question 9**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What is the main difference between screened cabling and fully shielded cabling?
- ☐ Fully shielded cabling has no shielding at all.
- ✅ Screened cabling has one thin outer foil shield around all pairs.
- ☐ Fully shielded cabling uses foil-shielded pairs without an outer shield.
- ☐ Screened cabling uses a braided outer screen only.

**Explanation:**  
- **Screened cabling** (ScTP / F/UTP) = 1 **outer foil shield** around the group of pairs.  
- **Fully shielded cabling** (S/FTP or F/FTP) = **individual shielding on each pair** + possibly additional outer shielding (braid or foil).
- The incorrect answer about foil-shielded pairs **without an outer shield** is misleading. Fully shielded typically includes both.

👉 So:  
- **Screened = outer foil only**  
- **Fully shielded = shielded pairs inside, often + outer shielding**

**Question 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What is the primary purpose of twisting the pairs in an unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable?  
- ☐ To color-code the cable for easier identification  
- ✅ To reduce external interference and crosstalk  
- ☐ To make the cable more flexible  
- ☐ To increase the cable's thickness  

**Explanation:**  
Twisting the pairs helps cancel out electromagnetic interference (EMI) and reduces **crosstalk** between pairs by minimizing the noise signal that can be induced in neighboring wires.
