![[Pasted image 20250706191722.png]]
## 🧵 Twisted Pair Cable Basics

- Made of **color-coded wire pairs**, each pair twisted together.
- Twisting helps cancel out **electromagnetic interference (EMI)**.
- Each pair is a **balanced line**: one positive, one negative.

📌 **Twisting prevents crosstalk** between wire pairs  
📌 **Used in telephony and Ethernet cabling**

## 🪛 Conductor Types

### 🔹 Solid Conductor
- Single, thick copper wire
- Better performance
- Best for **permanent installation** (inside walls)
- **22–24 AWG** typical

### 🔹 Stranded Conductor
- Multiple thin strands twisted together
- More flexible
- Used in **patch cords**
- **26 AWG**, but higher attenuation  
  ⚠️ Not ideal for runs over **5 meters**

## 🧰 UTP in Practice

- **UTP = Unshielded Twisted Pair**
- Most common for office Ethernet
- Cheap, light, easy to terminate
- No shielding — depends solely on twisting for noise reduction
- Used in **structured cabling / flood wiring**
