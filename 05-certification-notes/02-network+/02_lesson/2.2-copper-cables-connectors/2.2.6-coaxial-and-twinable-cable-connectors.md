# 2.2.6 — Coaxial and Twinaxial Cable and Connectors

---

## 📡 Coaxial Cable

- Coaxial (or coax) cable has **two conductors sharing the same axis**.
- Inner conductor: **solid or stranded copper wire**, surrounded by plastic insulation.
- Outer conductor: **braided mesh or foil** (shielding).
- Purpose: **Protects against EMI (electromagnetic interference)**.
- Used for:  
  - Cable Access TV (CATV)  
  - Broadband internet  
  - CCTV (closed-circuit television)

## 📏 RG Ratings (Radio Grade)

- **RG** = rating system for coax cables.
- Indicates thickness and impedance.
- Common types:
  - **RG6** = 18 AWG, 75-ohm, broadband/CATV
  - **RG59** = thinner, flexible, used for CCTV

- **BNC (Bayonet Neill–Concelman)**  
  - Twist-and-lock style  
  - Used in CCTV, AV systems
- **F-Type**  
  - Screw-on connector  
  - Used in cable internet and CATV

## 🔁 Twinaxial Cable (Twinax)

![[Pasted image 20250706213513.png]]

- Twinax has **two copper conductors** (not one like coax).
- Used in **data centers**:
  - 10 GbE (10GBASE-CR)
  - 40 GbE (40GBASE-CR4)
- Max distance:
  - Passive: **5 meters**
  - Active: **10 meters**
- Terminates with: **DAC (Direct Attach Copper)** transceivers
- Connects to: switches, routers, servers
