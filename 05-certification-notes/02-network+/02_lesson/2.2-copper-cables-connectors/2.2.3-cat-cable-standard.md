## üßµ 2.2.3 ‚Äì Cat Cable Standardsyterw32

### Standards Overview

The ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and TIA/EIA (Telecommunications Industry Association / Electronic Industries Alliance) developed category standards for twisted-pair cables. These standards simplify cable selection and ensure compatibility across structured cabling systems.

They are formalized under ANSI/TIA/EIA-568 and further refined in ISO/IEC 11801, which defines component categories and permanent link performance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Cable Standards Quick Reference

| **Cat/Class**        | **Cable Type**                    | **Ethernet Standard** | **Max Distance**     | **Frequency** | **Connector**   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Cat 5e (Class D)     | UTP or F/UTP                      | 1000BASE-T             | 100 m (328 ft)       | 100 MHz       | RJ45            |
| Cat 6 (Class E)      | UTP, F/UTP, or U/FTP              | 1000BASE-T / 10GbE     | 100 m / 55 m         | 250 MHz       | RJ45            |
| Cat 6A (Class Ea)    | UTP, F/UTP, U/FTP, or S/FTP       | 10GBASE-T              | 100 m (328 ft)       | 500 MHz       | RJ45            |
| Cat 7 (Class F)      | S/FTP or F/FTP                    | 10GBASE-T              | 100 m (328 ft)       | 600 MHz       | GG45 / TERA     |
| Cat 8 / 8.1 (Class I)| U/FTP or F/UTP                    | 40GBASE-T              | 30 m (100 ft)        | 2,000 MHz     | RJ45            |
| Cat 8.2 (Class II)   | F/FTP or S/FTP                    | 40GBASE-T              | 30 m (100 ft)        | 2,000 MHz     | GG45 / TERA     |

**üß† Note:**
- **UTP** = Unshielded Twisted Pair
- **F/UTP** = Foiled with Unshielded Twisted Pairs
- **S/FTP** = Shielded with Foiled Twisted Pairs
- **U/FTP** = Unshielded cable with Foil around each twisted pair
- **GG45/TERA** connectors are high-performance alternatives to RJ45, used in high-speed data cabling

This table is your cheat sheet for choosing the right category cable for the right Ethernet application. RJ45 still rules in most common builds, but higher categories like 7 and 8 bring higher speeds‚Äîand stricter requirements.
