## 2.2.5 Plenum and Riser-rated Cable

When choosing a copper cable type, basic considerations include:
- Category
- Unshielded vs shielded
- Solid vs stranded
- Compliance with building codes

### ðŸ”µ Plenum Space
A plenum is a void in a building (often above ceiling tiles) used for HVAC or cabling. It has:
- High airflow
- No fire breaks
- Higher temperatures

Because of these conditions, plenum cable **must**:
- Be **fire-retardant**
- Emit **low smoke**
- Be **self-extinguishing**
- Meet strict fire codes

Plenum cables are jacketed with:
- **FEP** (fluorinated ethylene propylene)
- Or treated **PVC**

Plenum-rated cable = marked **CMP** (Communications Plenum)

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Non-Plenum Cable (General Purpose)
Uses:
- Treated **PVC**
- Or **FEP**, but less flexible

These are used where fire risk is lower. Labeled as **CM**, **CMG**, or **CMX**.

---

### ðŸ”´ Riser Cable
Used **between building floors** (e.g., vertical shafts, conduits).
- Must be **fire-stopped**
- Prevents vertical fire spread

**Riser-rated cable** = marked **CMR**

---

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** You can use **plenum** cable instead of **riser**, but NEVER riser instead of plenum.  
> Both often include **filament or rope** to support vertical weight.
