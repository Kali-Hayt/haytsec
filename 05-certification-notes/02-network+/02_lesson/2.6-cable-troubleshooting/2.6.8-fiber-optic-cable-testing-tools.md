### Fiber Optic Cable Testing Tools

When working with fiber optic cabling, any mismatch between cables can result in serious **data loss**. Problems include:

- Misalignment
- Different cable sizes
- Broken or misshaped strands during transport

⚠️ Mixing single-mode and multimode fiber = **up to 99% signal loss**  
⚠️ Mismatched diameters of same fiber type = **up to 50% signal loss**

### Insertion Loss

Any connector introduces **insertion loss** — loss of signal strength at connection points.  
Some light reflects back toward the source, causing **back-reflection** or **optical return loss (ORL)**.

- **UPC (Ultra Physical Contact)** and  
- **APC (Angled Physical Contact)** connectors reduce reflection.

🔍 Mating APC to non-APC causes severe signal loss.  
🟢 APC connectors are always **green** to help avoid mixing.

### Visual Fault Locator

To identify a break in a fiber cable:

- Use a **visual fault locator (VFL)**.
- Tool sends visible light through the cable.
- Breaks glow at the damaged, bent, or spliced point.

VFLs come with:
- Short or long range models
- Adapters for ST, SC, LC connectors

### Dirty Optical Cables

Dust, dirt, grease, or contamination in connectors will **block or weaken** transmission.

- Always use **dust caps** on unused connectors.
- Clean with **fiber optic solvent** (wet-to-dry method)
- Use **lint-free cloths** for cleaning.

💡 Clean before disconnection.  
🧼 Clean splicing tools according to **manufacturer’s guidelines**.

> ⚠️ **Safety Warning**: Fiber light sources are hazardous.  
> - Never look directly into active ports.  
> - Use smartphone camera to check for infrared transmission.  
> - Always wear **safety goggles**.
