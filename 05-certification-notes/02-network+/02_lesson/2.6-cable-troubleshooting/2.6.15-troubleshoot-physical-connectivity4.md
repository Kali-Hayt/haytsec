## üß™ Network+ Lab 2.6.15 - Troubleshoot Physical Connectivity 4

### üß≠ Scenario

You are a network technician for a small corporate network.

An employee in **Office 1** reports that after she added a pair of speakers to her workstation, she could no longer communicate with the **CorpServer** in the **Networking Closet**.

You must diagnose and fix the problem.

### üñ•Ô∏è IP Address Reference Table

| Location           | Computer Name | IP Address     |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Networking Closet  | CorpServer    | 192.168.0.10   |
| Office 2           | Office2       | 192.168.0.31   |
| IT Administration  | ITAdmin       | 192.168.0.33   |

---

### üîß Lab Objectives

- Use the following tools to **diagnose the network problem**:
  - `ping` command utility
  - Network activity (link) lights on all networking devices
  - The **Network and Internet Status** app (Windows 11 or Server 2019)

- **Fix the problem**, using known-good spares on the shelf if necessary

- Re-use the same troubleshooting tools to **confirm the issue is resolved**

---

### üí° Hint (implied by scenario)

> The user added **speakers** before the connection failed. This may suggest:
> - Ethernet cable was accidentally unplugged
> - Speaker jack was mistakenly plugged into the **NIC port**
> - Cable was bumped, bent, or moved to the wrong port

---

### üß† Troubleshooting Strategy (Suggested Flow)

1. Start from **ITAdmin (192.168.0.33)** ‚Äî your known good system
2. `ping 192.168.0.10` ‚Üí Is the server reachable?
3. `ping 192.168.0.31` ‚Üí Is Office2 reachable?
4. Attempt to ping the broken workstation (Office1 if visible)
5. Move to Office1 workstation
   - Check **Ethernet cable** is plugged into correct port
   - Confirm **link lights** on NIC and switch
   - Run `ipconfig` to check for valid IP
6. Reseat or replace the Ethernet cable if necessary
7. Confirm restoration of connectivity by repeating `ping` tests

---

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- Office1 is reconnected to the network
- Can successfully ping:
  - CorpServer (192.168.0.10)
  - ITAdmin (192.168.0.33)
  - Office2 (192.168.0.31)
- Link lights are active and blinking on both NIC and switch

### üóíÔ∏è Reflection

This lab focuses on **real-world user error** causing a **physical disconnect**. It reinforces:
- Always investigate **user-added hardware** during failure reports
- Don‚Äôt assume a device is broken ‚Äî verify cables and ports first
- Link lights and `ipconfig` are your best friends at Layer 1
