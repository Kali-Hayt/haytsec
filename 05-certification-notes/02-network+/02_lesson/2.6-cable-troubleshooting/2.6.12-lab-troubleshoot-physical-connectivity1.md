## üß™ Network+ Lab 2.6.12 - Troubleshoot Physical Connectivity 1

### üß≠ Scenario
You're a network technician in a small corporate network. An employee in **Office 1** reports they can‚Äôt communicate with the computer in **Office 2**, and they've asked you to fix the issue.

### üñ•Ô∏è IP Address Table

| Location           | Computer Name | IP Address     |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Networking Closet  | CorpServer    | 192.168.0.10   |
| Office 1           | Office1       | 192.168.0.30   |
| Office 2           | Office2       | 192.168.0.31   |
| IT Administration  | ITAdmin       | 192.168.0.33   |
| Executive Office   | Exec          | 192.168.0.34   |

### üîß Task Objectives

- Use the following troubleshooting tools to diagnose the network issue:
  - `ping` utility
  - Network activity lights on all networking devices
  - The **Network and Internet Status** page (Windows 10 or Server 2019)

- Fix the issue using known good spares (from the shelf) if necessary.
- Use the same tools to confirm the problem is resolved.

### üß† Notes & Strategy

1. **Step 1: Test connectivity from Office 1 to Office 2**
   - Run: `ping 192.168.0.31` from Office1
   - If it fails, check:
     - Link lights on NICs and switch ports
     - Windows Network Settings for disconnections

2. **Step 2: Check physical cable**
   - Reseat or replace the Ethernet cable if link lights are off
   - Use a known working cable from the spare shelf if needed

3. **Step 3: Check IP settings**
   - Ensure static IP matches the table
   - Look for duplicate IPs or wrong subnet

4. **Step 4: Confirm fix**
   - Ping Office2 from Office1 again
   - Try pinging other systems (e.g., 192.168.0.10)

---

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- Office1 can ping Office2 (192.168.0.31)
- Network lights are active
- All systems can communicate within the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet

### üóíÔ∏è Reflection

This lab reinforced basic Layer 1 (physical) and Layer 3 (IP) troubleshooting. I practiced using simple tools like `ping` and network LEDs to trace a real-world communication failure between two systems. I also reviewed how to verify cable integrity, device connectivity, and network interface configurations in Windows. A good reminder that **not all network issues are software-based ‚Äî sometimes it‚Äôs just a bad cable**.
