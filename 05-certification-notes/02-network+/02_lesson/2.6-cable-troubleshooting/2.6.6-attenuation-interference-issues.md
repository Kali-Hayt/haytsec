### Attenuation and Interference Issues

If a cable link is too long, **decibel (dB) loss** (or insertion loss) may cause the link to experience:
- Signal degradation
- High error rates
- Frame or packet retransmissions
- Reduced speed or connectivity

**Insertion loss** is measured in decibels (dB), representing the **ratio of received voltage to original voltage**.

### üìà Understanding Decibels (dB)

- dB is a **logarithmic scale** used to express ratio changes.
- It's commonly used to simplify complex multiplication and division into addition/subtraction.

**Useful conversions**:
- +3 dB = double the power  
- -3 dB = half the power  
- +6 dB = quadruple the power  
- -6 dB = one-quarter the power  
- +10 dB = 10x power  
- -10 dB = one-tenth the power

### üîç Maximum Allowable Insertion Loss

Depends on **cable category**:
- Cat 5e @ 100 MHz ‚Üí up to **24 dB**
- Cat 6 @ 250 MHz ‚Üí up to **21.7 dB**

**Lower is better** when measuring actual insertion loss:
- 20 dB is better than 22 dB

**Cable certifiers** measure **margin**:
- Margin = maximum allowed - actual measured loss
- Higher margins are better

**Example**:
- Measured 22 dB on Cat 5e = 2 dB margin (closer to failure threshold)
- Measured 23 dB = only 1 dB margin ‚Üí risk of poor performance

**Solutions**:
- Use higher-grade or shielded cable
- Reduce cable length
- Add repeater or switch

### ‚ö° Interference Considerations

**Sources of EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)**:
- Electrical power cables
- Fluorescent lights
- Motors, fans, transmitters

**üß† Alien Crosstalk**: Interference from other nearby cables

**Install considerations**:
- Check for newly installed devices after testing
- Ensure cable routing avoids EMI sources

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)**: EMI that affects **radio frequencies**.
