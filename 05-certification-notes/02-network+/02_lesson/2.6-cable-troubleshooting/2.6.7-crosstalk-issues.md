### Crosstalk Issues

Crosstalk usually indicates:
- Bad wiring (poor quality, damaged, or wrong type)
- Bad connectors or improper terminations
- Excessive untwisting at cable ends
- Kinks or crush points along the run

Crosstalk is measured in **decibels (dB)**.  
**Higher dB = less noise** (good).  
**Lower dB = more noise/interference** (bad).

### Types of Crosstalk:

- **🔍 Near End Crosstalk (NEXT)**  
  - Measured at the **transmitter end**  
  - Caused by poor pair twisting or bad shielding

- **🔍 Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio, Near End (ACRN)**  
  - Difference between **insertion loss** and **NEXT**  
  - Like signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)  
  - **High ACRN = strong signal**  
  - **Low ACRN = likely high error rate**

- **🔍 Attenuation-to-Crosstalk Ratio, Far End (ACRF)**  
  - Measured at **recipient end** (Far End Crosstalk or FEXT)  
  - Difference between insertion loss and FEXT  
  - Shows performance **regardless of cable length**

- **🔍 Power Sum Crosstalk**  
  - Used in Gigabit and 10GbE (all four pairs active)  
  - Includes: `PSNEXT`, `PSACRN`, `PSACRF`  
  - Each is calculated with three of four pairs energized

- **🔍 Alien Crosstalk**  
  - Interference from **adjacent cables**  
  - Caused by tight cable bundles or poor termination
