## 2.6.2 ‚Äì Cable Issues

When troubleshooting cable connectivity, focus on **Layer 1 (Physical layer)** issues.

### Ethernet Link Components (Office Workstation Setup)

A typical Ethernet link includes:

- Network transceiver in the host (**end system**)
- Patch cable between the host and a wall port
- Structured (permanent) cable between wall port and patch panel
- Patch cable between patch panel and switch port
- Network transceiver in the **switch port**

### Link Failure Troubleshooting (Complete Loss of Connectivity)

#### Step 1: Check Patch Cords
- Ensure patch cords are **properly terminated** and connected.
- Suspect a bad cord? üëâ Swap with a **known-good patch cable**.

#### Step 2: Test Transceivers
- Use a **loopback tool** to test for a **bad port** or **NIC failure**.
- ‚ùó If no loopback tool is available:
  - Connect a **known working computer** to the same port
  - Or try **swapping switch ports**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Not always reliable due to **port security policies**

#### Step 3: Test Structured Cabling
- If patch cords and transceivers are OK, test the **permanent link**.
- May require:
  - Installing new cabling
  - Checking for **bad termination**
  - Identifying **external interference**

### Tips

- Always **eliminate patch cord issues first** ‚Äî easiest to replace.
- Use **diagnostic tools** if deeper testing is required.
- Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs the cable ‚Äî NICs and switch ports **fail too**.
