### Steps to Troubleshoot Cable Issues

1. **Physical Inspection**
   - Look for **visible damage**: cuts, kinks, or severe bends
   - Make sure **connectors are intact** and securely plugged in

2. **Reseat the Cable**
   - Unplug from both ends
   - Reconnect â€” this can fix **loose connection issues**

3. **Verify Drivers**
   - If the issue remains, it could be **driver-related**
   - Use **Device Manager**:
     - Find your network adapter
     - Check if it's working properly
   - If not:
     - **Update the driver**, or  
     - **Replace the network adapter**
