## 🧱 2.1.3 – Media Access Control and Collision Domains

### 🔄 Media Access Control (MAC)

Ethernet is a **multiple access** network—nodes share the same media to communicate.  
**Media Access Control (MAC)** determines **how and when** devices can transmit on shared media and handle conflicts when two try to talk at once.

---

### 💥 Collision Domains

All nodes on the same shared media are in the same **collision domain**.  
When two nodes transmit at the same time, **collisions occur**, and data must be **resent**.

- More nodes = More collisions
- More collisions = **Lower effective bandwidth**

---

### 📡 CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

Ethernet’s protocol for media access is called **CSMA/CD**:

1. **Carrier Sense**: Listen to the line first.
2. **Multiple Access**: Everyone has equal access to transmit.
3. **Collision Detection**: If a collision happens, stop, send a **jam signal**, then **wait randomly (backoff)** before retrying.

📌 Applies to **half-duplex** Ethernet only  
→ A device can either **transmit or receive**, but **not both at once**.

### 🏚️ Legacy Example: 10BASE-T with a Hub

- Star wiring layout
- Each node connected to a **hub**, which rebroadcasts signals to all nodes
- All devices on that hub = same **collision domain**
- Used in the **1990s** — now obsolete and replaced by **switches** (which isolate collisions)

```text
🧠 Key takeaway: Modern switches break up collision domains — hubs do NOT.
```

## ❓ Unique MAC ≠ Collision-Free

🆔 Every device has a **unique MAC address** to identify itself on the network.

⚠️ BUT — if devices share the **same physical medium** (cable, frequency, etc.),  
they must **take turns** sending data.

💥 If two transmit at once, their signals **collide**, even if their MACs are different.

📌 This is why Ethernet uses **CSMA/CD** to coordinate access on shared media.

---
## 🔌 What Does “Same Media” Mean in Networking?

“Same media” = Devices are **sharing** the **same physical transmission path**, such as:

- 🔁 **Same Ethernet hub** (all ports repeat to all devices)
- 🔗 **Same coaxial cable segment** (classic bus topology)
- 📡 **Same wireless channel** (Wi-Fi frequency)

Even though each device has a **unique MAC address**, they’re still **talking over the same road** — and must take turns to avoid collisions.

---

### ✅ Examples of “Same Media”
- Two PCs plugged into the **same hub** → ✅ Same media
- Devices connected to **the same switch port** (if bridged) → ✅ Same media
- Clients on the **same Wi-Fi access point** → ✅ Same media
- Devices on **different switch ports** (full-duplex) → ❌ Not same media (isolated paths)

---

📌 **Reminder:**  
> **Routers** separate **broadcast domains**, but they don’t define what counts as "same media."  
> "Same media" is about **who’s sharing the physical line or frequency**, not IP/subnet.

## 🧠 Why Switches Replaced Hubs: Collision Elimination

### ❌ Problem with Hubs:
- Hubs **repeat** incoming signals to **all other ports**
- All devices on a hub share the **same collision domain**
- If two devices transmit at once → 💥 **collision**
- Requires **CSMA/CD** to recover (slow, inefficient)

---

### ✅ Why Switches Are Better:
- Switches create a **dedicated connection** between sender and receiver
- Each port is its **own collision domain**
- Full-duplex: devices can **send and receive simultaneously**
- No need for CSMA/CD — **no collisions**

---

### ⚡ Key Benefits of Switches:
- **More efficient use of bandwidth**
- **Faster communication**
- **Better scalability** (especially for busy networks)

---

### 📌 TL;DR:
```
Hubs = one collision domain ➜ collisions guaranteed
Switches = separate collision domains ➜ collisions eliminated
```
