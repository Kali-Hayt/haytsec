## ⚙️ 2.1.2 – Ethernet Standards

Over time, many protocols, standards, and products have been developed to support the **Physical** and **Data Link** layers of the OSI model.  
Each standard defines the required **cable/connectors** and **modulation/encoding schemes** for that implementation.

The **IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standards** are the most widely used for both LANs and WANs.  
They ensure consistent media specifications that meet bandwidth needs across environments.

### 🧩 Ethernet Naming Format – xBASE-y

Ethernet standards use a **three-part naming convention**:

1. The **bit rate** (e.g., `10`, `100`, `1000` Mbps or `10` Gbps)
2. The **signal type** (always `BASE` for baseband Ethernet)
3. A **media type indicator** (e.g., `T` for twisted pair, `F` for fiber)

📌 **Example:**  
`10BASE-T` means:
- 10 Mbps speed
- BASEband signaling
- T = Twisted pair copper cabling

### 🧵 Copper Cable Notes

- Copper cables transmit signals via **low-voltage electric current**
- Two types:
  - **Twisted pair**
  - **Coaxial (coax)**

Twisted pair is the most common, but it suffers from **high attenuation** (signal loss) over long distances.  
Cables are rated by **Category (Cat)** standards, which define:
- Supported bandwidth (MHz)
- Maximum distance at rated speed

```text
💡 Example: Cat5e supports 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) up to 100 meters
```

## 🎛️ Modulation and Encoding Schemes (Networking)

### 🔧 Definitions

- **Modulation**: The process of altering a physical signal (voltage, light, radio wave) to represent data.  
  → Example: switching voltage levels on a wire to signal 1s and 0s.

- **Encoding**: The method of formatting digital data (binary) for transmission over the medium.  
  → Example: deciding how many voltage changes = a 1 or 0.

### 💡 Real-World Analogy

> Modulation is how you blink a flashlight.  
> Encoding is what each blink pattern means (e.g., 1 blink = 1, 2 blinks = 0).

---

### 📡 In Ethernet:

Different Ethernet standards use different **encoding methods** to increase speed and efficiency:
- `100BASE-TX` uses **MLT-3**
- `1000BASE-T` uses **PAM-5**
- These impact:
  - Data rate
  - Signal reliability
  - Cable bandwidth requirements

---

### 🧾 TL;DR

- **Modulation** = How the signal is physically changed to carry data  
- **Encoding** = How digital bits are organized into those signal changes  
- Both are **defined in Ethernet standards** so devices can communicate correctly
