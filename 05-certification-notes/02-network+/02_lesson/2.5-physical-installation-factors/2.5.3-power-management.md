## ‚ö° 2.5.3 Power Management

Power issues can cause **hardware damage**, **data loss**, and **downtime**. Network infrastructure must be protected with proper power distribution, surge suppression, and backup systems.

### üîå Power Distribution Units (PDUs)

- Installed inside racks to distribute power to multiple devices.
- Can be **horizontal** or **vertical**.
- Two main types:
  - **Basic PDUs**: Provide raw power distribution.
  - **Intelligent PDUs**: Support monitoring, control, and alerts.

#### Features of Smart PDUs:
- Track **power usage** per device.
- Provide **alerts** for overloads or failures.
- Allow **remote reboot** or shutdown of devices.
- Help with **load balancing** across circuits.

### üîã Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)

Used to maintain power during outages and protect against surges, brownouts, and line noise.

UPS sits between **equipment** and **main AC power source**.

#### Types of UPS:

- **Standby (Offline)**:
  - Passes AC power normally.
  - Switches to battery only during power loss.
  - Cheapest and simplest.

- **Line-Interactive**:
  - Regulates voltage during brownouts/surges.
  - Switches to battery only when necessary.
  - Suitable for moderate protection.

- **Online (Double Conversion)**:
  - Converts AC to DC, then back to AC.
  - Devices run on battery **all the time**.
  - Highest protection, **zero transfer time**.
  - Used in **critical systems** (servers, storage).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Power Monitoring and Alerts

- Intelligent UPS units offer:
  - **Status reports**
  - **Battery diagnostics**
  - **Event logging**
  - **SNMP integration** for network alerts
- Can notify admins of:
  - Voltage irregularities
  - Battery failures
  - Runtime estimates during an outage

### üîÑ Summary

Reliable power is essential for network stability.  
PDUs manage **distribution**, UPS units manage **continuity**.  
Smart systems provide visibility and **remote control** to prevent disaster.
