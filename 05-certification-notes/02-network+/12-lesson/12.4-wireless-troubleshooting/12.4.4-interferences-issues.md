## 12.4.4 – Interference Issues

### ❗ General Concept

If a device is within range but the signal is weak or unusable, you're likely facing **interference** — not just signal loss.

Beyond CCI (co-channel) and ACI (adjacent channel), there are other **interference culprits**:

---

## 🔁 Reflection / Multipath Interference

- Caused by **mirrors, metal, or shiny surfaces**.
- Signal **bounces**, creating **delays** → results in **packet loss** and **lower data rate**.

🧠 **Note:** Wi-Fi 4/5/6 use this "bounce" intentionally with **MIMO** to enhance throughput. It’s a double-edged sword.

---

## 🔄 Refraction

- Happens when **glass or water** bends the signal.
- Causes the wave to take a **different path**, degrading reliability and reducing data rate.

---

## 🧱 Absorption

- Radio waves lose energy (converted to heat) when passing through materials like:
  - Walls
  - Windows
  - People

📉 Internal wall loss:
- Ranges from **3 to 15 dB** (worst = concrete)

💡 **2.4 GHz** penetrates better than **5 GHz** for same power output.

✅ **Tip:** Use **ceiling-mounted APs** to avoid human/furniture absorption zones.

---

## 📡 Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

- Comes from **non-Wi-Fi RF sources** operating in the same band:
  - Bluetooth
  - Cordless phones
  - Microwaves
  - Radios

---

## 🔍 Detecting Interference

Use a **spectrum analyzer** (NOT just a Wi-Fi analyzer):

- **Wi-Fi analyzers** only see Wi-Fi signals.
- **Spectrum analyzers** detect **all radio energy** (EMI included).
- Often handheld, with **directional antennas** for pinpointing sources.
- **6 dB change** = signal halved or doubled in power (used to estimate distance).

---

## TL;DR Summary

- Mirrors, glass, and bodies all **mess with Wi-Fi** in different ways.
- Reflection adds delay, refraction bends the path, absorption eats the signal.
- EMI = invisible enemy — must be hunted with a spectrum analyzer.
- Know the **material cost** of your environment, and **plan AP placement** accordingly.
