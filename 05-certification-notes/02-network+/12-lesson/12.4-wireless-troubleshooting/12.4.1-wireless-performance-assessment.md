## 12.4.1 - Wireless Performance Assessment

Wireless performance troubleshooting breaks into two major camps:
- 🧱 **Physical Layer issues** (signal strength, interference)
- 🔐 **Configuration issues** (auth/security misconfigs)

**⚠️ Always verify authentication and security settings are correct before blaming Physical Layer problems.**

## Bit Rate vs. Throughput

- **Bit Rate**  
  - Total data transferred per second at the **Physical/Data Link layers** (Layers 1 & 2).
  - Determined by Wi-Fi standards (e.g., Wi-Fi 5, Wi-Fi 6), bonded channels, MU-MIMO.
  - Environmental factors (distance, interference) can force negotiation to lower speeds.

- **Throughput**  
  - Actual data transferred at the **Network layer** (Layer 3), *excluding* protocol overhead.
  - Affected by congestion, interference, retransmissions.
  - ✅ "Goodput" = application-level throughput (user data only).

## RF Attenuation & Signal Degradation

🧱 **Free Space Path Loss** = signal weakens with distance due to:
- Inverse-square law: doubling distance = ¼ the signal power.
- Interference from other devices = "noise."

📉 **Signal Loss Factors:**
- Transmission power (e.g., 14 dBm = ~25 mW)
- Antenna gain (e.g., 3 dBi)
- Distance path loss (e.g., 70 dB over 30 meters)

### Example Calculation:

**Signal strength at receiver:**
(14 dBm + 3 dBi) - 70 dB = -53 dBm ≈ 0.000005 mW

**If noise = -80 dBm:**
SNR = Signal - Noise = -53 dBm - (-80 dBm) = 27 dB


✅ **Target SNR margin:** 20+ dB  
🏠 **Indoor loss budgeting:** ~5 dB per internal wall

## Tools for Measurement

- **Wi-Fi Analyzer Software**  
  - Installed on laptops or smartphones.
  - Records stats from the client’s current AP.
  - Can detect nearby APs, SSIDs, channels, signal levels.

- **Dedicated Wi-Fi Tester Hardware**  
  - Used for professional-grade analysis.

## TL;DR Summary

- Don’t confuse bit rate (theoretical max) with throughput (actual performance).
- Signal strength drops drastically with distance—use math to predict it.
- SNR > 20 dB = healthy connection.
- Analyze with Wi-Fi tools before guessing. Noise and walls *are real enemies.*
