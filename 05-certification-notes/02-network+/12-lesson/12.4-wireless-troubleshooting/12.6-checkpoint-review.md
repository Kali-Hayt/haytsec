# QUESTION 1  
What is the purpose of maintaining correct polarity in duplex fiber optic patch cords?

❌ To enhance the aesthetic appeal of the fiber optic installation  
❌ To ensure that the power supply is evenly distributed across all fibers  
❌ To increase the speed of data transmission over the fiber optic cable  
✅ To guarantee that the Tx port on the transmitter is linked to the Rx port on the receiver and vice versa

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Aesthetics* have nothing to do with signal polarity or data transmission.
- ❌ *Power supply* isn't even relevant in optical fiber communications—there’s no electrical power being delivered across the fiber.
- ❌ *Speed of transmission* is not affected by polarity. The physical link works or it doesn’t; polarity ensures signal goes where it's supposed to.

# QUESTION 2  
What type of cabling do most Ethernet adapters designed for use with copper cabling now support?

❌ USB cable  
❌ Coaxial cable  
✅ Gigabit Ethernet  
❌ HDMI cable

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *USB cable* is used for peripherals and power, not standard Ethernet transmission.
- ❌ *Coaxial cable* was used in older Ethernet standards like 10BASE2/10BASE5 but is now obsolete for Ethernet.
- ❌ *HDMI* is strictly for video and audio, not networking.

# QUESTION 3  
What might cause a host to send a reset (RST) segment during a TCP session?

❌ The host receives a segment out of order.  
✅ The host decides to abruptly end the session.  
❌ The host wishes to establish a new TCP connection.  
❌ The host receives an ACK for an unexpected segment.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Out-of-order segments* are handled with buffering and retransmission, not resets.
- ❌ *Establishing a new TCP connection* uses SYN, not RST.
- ❌ *Receiving an unexpected ACK* might be ignored or logged, but it won’t trigger an RST unless it’s part of a larger error.

# QUESTION 4  
You are setting up a wireless network in a newly opened branch of your company. The branch is located in a building where it's not feasible to run cables between different sections. You decide to implement a Wireless Distribution System (WDS) to ensure coverage throughout the building. You purchase several APs from different vendors to take advantage of various deals.

After setting up the network, you notice that the APs are not communicating effectively with each other, leading to poor wireless coverage in some areas.

What is the MOST likely cause of this issue?

❌ The beacon frame broadcast interval is set too low.  
✅ The APs from different vendors have compatibility issues.  
❌ The APs are set to different channels.  
❌ The APs are broadcasting their SSID too frequently.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Beacon interval* affects how often APs announce themselves to clients, not AP-to-AP communication.
- ❌ *Different channels* are typically used to reduce interference—not a direct cause of AP communication failure unless set improperly.
- ❌ *Frequent SSID broadcasting* doesn’t hinder AP-to-AP comms in WDS; it's mostly client-side noise.

# QUESTION 5  
What is the calculation for Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)?

❌ Total operational time divided by the number of devices  
❌ Number of devices divided by the total number of failures  
✅ Total operational time divided by the number of failures  
❌ Total number of failures divided by the total operational time

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Devices* aren't used in the MTBF formula—it’s a time-to-failure metric, not a per-device metric.
- ❌ Dividing *devices by failures* doesn’t give time, which is what MTBF measures.
- ❌ *Failures ÷ operational time* is actually the formula for **failure rate**, not MTBF.

🧠 **MTBF = Total uptime ÷ Number of failures** — it tells you how long something typically runs before it breaks.

# QUESTION 6  
A network engineer is tasked with designing a new office network. The office layout includes workstations that are located more than 100 meters away from the network room. The engineer needs to choose the appropriate type of unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable to ensure reliable data transmission over these distances.  
Which solution should the network engineer choose for the UTP cables that will run from the network room to the workstations?

❌ Use UTP cables with stranded conductors and add repeaters to extend beyond 100 meters  
❌ Either stranded or solid, as both are equally effective over long distances  
❌ Neither, as UTP cables are not suitable for distances over 100 meters  
✅ Use UTP cables with a solid conductor and add repeaters to extend beyond 100 meters

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Stranded conductors* are more flexible and used for patch cables, but they lose signal over long distances.
- ❌ *Stranded and solid* are not equally effective—solid is better for long runs due to lower attenuation.
- ❌ *UTP not suitable* is incorrect. UTP **is** suitable with the proper setup and repeaters if needed.

🧱 **Solid core UTP** is the industry standard for long horizontal runs in structured cabling. When you go beyond 100m, you simply add a repeater or switch to maintain integrity.

# QUESTION 7  
Which component in the NetFlow architecture needs a high bandwidth network link and substantial storage capacity?

❌ NetFlow exporter  
✅ NetFlow collector  
❌ Network interface  
❌ NetFlow analyzer

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **NetFlow exporter** generates flow records and sends them out, but doesn’t store data long-term or need heavy bandwidth.
- ❌ **Network interface** is just the entry/exit point—no storage or analysis roles here.
- ❌ **NetFlow analyzer** processes the data after it's collected, but doesn’t need high bandwidth for collection or mas

# QUESTION 8  
What is a mission essential function (MEF)?

❌ A function that can be deferred until after a crisis.  
❌ A function that generates the most revenue for the organization.  
❌ A function that is only essential during a security audit.  
✅ A function that cannot be deferred after a disruption.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Can be deferred**: That's the exact *opposite* of what makes something “mission essential.”
- ❌ **Generates the most revenue**: Revenue ≠ essential during a crisis. Some high-revenue functions can be paused without crippling operations.
- ❌ **Only essential during a security audit**: MEFs aren't defined by audit schedules—they're core to keeping the business alive post-disruption.

🧱 MEFs are critical operations that must **continue or be rapidly resumed** during/after emergencies. Think: payroll, emergency services dispatch, or maintaining power in a hospital.

# QUESTION 9  
Which of the following IP address ranges is NOT publicly routable and reserved for special use?

❌ 172.16.0.0/12  
❌ 23.0.0.0/8  
❌ 198.51.100.0/24  
✅ 192.88.99.0/24  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **172.16.0.0/12**: This is part of the private IP space (RFC 1918). It’s non-routable, but it’s not "special use" — it’s for internal networks.
- ❌ **23.0.0.0/8**: This range *is* publicly routable. It's used in normal internet traffic.
- ❌ **198.51.100.0/24**: Reserved for **documentation/examples** under RFC 5737, not used in production — but it's *still valid as special-use*, not the best choice here.

✅ **192.88.99.0/24** was once used for **6to4 relay** in IPv6 transition mechanisms. It is now **deprecated** and **classified as reserved special use** by IANA. It is no longer routed across the public internet.

🧱 RFCs to know:
- RFC 5737 → Documentation ranges: 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24  
- RFC 7526 → 192.88.99.0/24 deprecated as of 2015

# QUESTION 10  
You have a server at work with a custom application installed. Connections to the server that use the custom application must use IPv6, but the server is currently running IPv4.

You're the only person who connects to the server, and you always use your Linux laptop for the connection. Your laptop supports both IPv4 and IPv6, but the rest of your company network runs only IPv4.

You need a cost-effective solution to allow your laptop to connect to the server. Your solution must also support communication through NAT servers.

Which client software should you use to connect to the server?

✅ Miredo  
❌ ISATAP  
❌ 4to6  
❌ 6to4  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **ISATAP**: Works for **intranets**, not NAT environments or public access. It also needs IPv6 on the host side.
- ❌ **4to6**: This is *not a real tunneling protocol*. It’s more of a conceptual direction—IPv4-to-IPv6 isn't the issue here anyway.
- ❌ **6to4**: Not ideal behind NAT. Requires a 6to4 relay router and a public IPv4 address, which your company does **not** provide.

✅ **Miredo** is a client implementation of **Teredo**, which works well for **single-client IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling** through NAT—**exactly** your use case.

# QUESTION 11  
What does it indicate if an LED fails to light up or does not light in sequence during a wire map test?

✅ There is a problem with the cable and/or termination.  
❌ The cable is of high quality.  
❌ The cable is shielded.  
❌ The cable length is too long.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The cable is of high quality**: High-quality cables don’t cause LEDs to fail during a test. That’s a red herring.
- ❌ **The cable is shielded**: Shielding doesn’t affect the LED light sequence in a wire map. That’s not what the test checks.
- ❌ **The cable length is too long**: Excess length can affect signal degradation but won’t cause wire map LED mismatches. Wire mapping is about correct pinout and continuity.

✅ If the LED doesn’t light or lights out of order, it’s usually a **miswire**, **short**, **open**, or **bad termination**—classic wiring error.

# QUESTION 12  
What is the primary connectivity method for IoT devices?

❌ Bluetooth  
✅ Wi-Fi  
❌ Zigbee  
❌ Ethernet  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Bluetooth**: Useful for short-range, low-energy connections (e.g., wearables), but not suitable for large-scale or high-throughput IoT systems.
- ❌ **Zigbee**: Excellent for **mesh** networks and low-power IoT (like sensors), but it’s **less commonly used** overall compared to Wi-Fi in mainstream consumer and industrial deployments.
- ❌ **Ethernet**: Requires a physical connection, which limits flexibility and mobility — most IoT devices are wireless.

✅ **Wi-Fi** is the **primary** connectivity method for **many mainstream IoT devices**, especially those requiring moderate bandwidth and access to existing network infrastructure (e.g., smart TVs, home assistants, security cams).  
🔍 Also widely supported, doesn’t require additional gateways like Zigbee often does.

# QUESTION 13  
What is the standard MTU of an Ethernet frame?

❌ 1024 bytes  
❌ 2048 bytes  
❌ 4096 bytes  
✅ 1500 bytes  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **1024 bytes**: This is not a recognized MTU size in Ethernet. It's a round number but not valid here.
- ❌ **2048 bytes**: Not a standard MTU size; might appear in custom networks, but not Ethernet.
- ❌ **4096 bytes**: Often confused with jumbo frames (which start at 9000 bytes), but this is way above standard.

✅ **1500 bytes** is the default Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for Ethernet—excluding headers. It's the payload size, not the entire frame.

# QUESTION 14  
What is a recommended solution to minimize absorption of Wi-Fi signals by office furniture and people?

❌ Increase the power output of the AP.  
✅ Use ceiling-mounted APs.  
❌ Place APs closer to the ground.  
❌ Use higher frequency bands.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Increase the power output of the AP**: This can cause interference and overshooting coverage areas, and it doesn't fix absorption—it just makes noise.
- ❌ **Place APs closer to the ground**: Terrible idea. Signals will be absorbed even more by desks, chairs, legs—human bodies.
- ❌ **Use higher frequency bands**: Higher frequencies (like 5 GHz or 6 GHz) are actually **more** susceptible to absorption and obstruction.

✅ **Use ceiling-mounted APs**: Mounting access points overhead gives the signal a clear path over obstacles like furniture and people. That’s why this is the professional standard.

# QUESTION 15  
What is a benefit of using IPAM software for managing DHCP and DNS servers?

❌ It automatically increases the number of available IP addresses.  
❌ It reduces the electricity consumption of the network.  
❌ It eliminates the need for physical servers.  
✅ It can often be used to manage the servers remotely.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Automatically increases the number of available IPs**: IPAM doesn't *create* more IPs out of thin air—it just tracks and organizes them efficiently.
- ❌ **Reduces electricity consumption**: That's more about hardware optimization and power management—not the role of IPAM.
- ❌ **Eliminates physical servers**: IPAM is software. You can deploy it virtually or on-prem, but it doesn't magically make hardware disappear.

✅ **Can be used to manage the servers remotely**: Spot on. IPAM tools provide centralized control and visibility over IP address spaces, and that includes remote management of DHCP/DNS functions.

# QUESTION 16  
What should you do when you discover symptoms of more than one problem while investigating a user's system issue?

❌ Focus on the most complex problem first, assuming solving it will automatically resolve the others.  
✅ Treat each problem as a separate case, even if they seem related.  
❌ Immediately escalate all discovered problems to a higher-level support team without further investigation.  
❌ Advise the user to only report the most severe problem to avoid complicating the troubleshooting process.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Focus on the most complex problem first**: Assuming a domino effect could leave real problems unresolved. Oversimplifies what could be multiple root causes.
- ❌ **Immediately escalate all problems**: Escalating everything is inefficient. You're frontline support—your job is to triage, not just throw hands up.
- ❌ **Tell the user to only report the most severe**: That’s sweeping symptoms under the rug. It delays full resolution and violates good support practices.

✅ **Treat each as a separate case**: This is methodical, professional troubleshooting. Each symptom gets the attention it deserves, even if connections emerge later.

# QUESTION 17  
A team of network engineers are refurbishing copper Ethernet cabling in a FEMA office. The federal government requires that copper twisted pair cabling be terminated according to the T568A standard.  
To ensure termination is being done according to standard, what color conductor will be wired to the second pin?

❌ Brown  
❌ Blue  
✅ Green  
❌ Orange  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Brown**: This pair is used on pins 7 and 8 in both T568A and T568B—not pin 2.
- ❌ **Blue**: Blue is assigned to pins 4 and 5 (center pair). Doesn’t touch pin 2.
- ❌ **Orange**: That’s pin 2 in the **T568B** standard, not T568A.

✅ **Green**: In the T568A wiring standard, **green** (solid) goes to **pin 2**, and **white/green** goes to pin

# QUESTION 18  
How has the concept of the network edge changed due to the erosion of the perimeter security model?

❌ It has been eliminated entirely.  
✅ It has expanded to include access switches and wireless access points.  
❌ It has become more focused on the physical location of the network.  
❌ It has become synonymous with the firewall.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Eliminated entirely**: The network edge hasn't disappeared—it’s just evolved. It still exists, but it's more dynamic and dispersed.
- ❌ **Physical location**: That’s old-school thinking. The edge is now logical, not just physical—thanks to mobile, cloud, and remote access.
- ❌ **Synonymous with firewall**: Firewalls are just one part. Edge includes **any entry point** into the network—not just security devices.

✅ **Expanded edge**: With zero trust, cloud, IoT, and mobile, your “network edge” now includes **access points, switches, VPN gateways**, and even user devices.

# QUESTION 19 
What is the maximum size of the data payload in a standard Ethernet frame?

❌ 18 bytes  
✅ 1500 bytes  
❌ 9018 bytes  
❌ 1518 bytes  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **18 bytes**: Way too small—this is closer to header sizes, not payload.
- ❌ **9018 bytes**: That’s a *jumbo frame*, used in special cases like high-performance networks, **not standard** Ethernet.
- ❌ **1518 bytes**: This includes the **Ethernet frame overhead** (headers + trailer), not just the payload.

✅ **1500 bytes** is the **maximum payload (data)** size in a standard Ethernet frame. The full frame size, with headers and CRC, adds up to 1518 bytes total.

# QUESTION 20  
When troubleshooting cable connectivity issues at the Physical layer, which of the following is NOT a component typically involved in an Ethernet link for an office workstation?

✅ Fiber optic cable between the host and a wall port  
❌ Network transceiver in the host  
❌ Structured cable between the wall port and a patch panel  
❌ Patch cable between the patch panel port and a switch port  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Network transceiver in the host**: This is standard in NICs (Network Interface Cards) and part of the physical link.
- ❌ **Structured cable between the wall port and a patch panel**: Classic part of structured cabling in office networks.
- ❌ **Patch cable between the patch panel port and a switch port**: Also standard — connects your patch panel to the networking gear.

✅ **Fiber optic cable between the host and a wall port** is *not* typical in standard office Ethernet setups. Most office workstations use **copper (UTP)** cabling (like Cat 5e/6), not fiber, unless it's a high-performance or specialized environment.
