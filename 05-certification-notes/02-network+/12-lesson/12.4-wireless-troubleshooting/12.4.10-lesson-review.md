# QUESTION 1  
What is antenna cable attenuation?

❌ The strengthening of a signal over a coax cable  
✅ The loss of signal strength along a coax cable  
❌ The increase in Wi-Fi signal due to better antenna placement  
❌ The process of adding more access points to a network  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *The strengthening of a signal over a coax cable* — That's amplification, not attenuation. Attenuation always refers to *loss*.  
- ❌ *The increase in Wi-Fi signal due to better antenna placement* — Signal gain from positioning ≠ attenuation.  
- ❌ *The process of adding more access points to a network* — That's network expansion, not signal loss in cabling.

# QUESTION 2  
What might unexpected client disassociations indicate if there is no roaming, interference, or standards support issue?

❌ A signal to upgrade the network equipment  
❌ A sign of excessive network traffic  
❌ A need for a firmware update  
✅ A potential malicious attack  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *A signal to upgrade the network equipment* — Not the first conclusion. Disassociations without clear cause suggest a deeper issue.  
- ❌ *A sign of excessive network traffic* — High traffic causes latency or drops, not *disassociations* per se.  
- ❌ *A need for a firmware update* — Possible, but not the most *immediate* or *likely* explanation if standards and interference are ruled out.  
- ✅ *A potential malicious attack* — Deauth/disassociation attacks are common tactics used in Wi-Fi-based threats like Evil Twin setups.

# QUESTION 3  
What is Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and how can it be detected?

✅ EMI is interference from a powerful source in the same frequency band.  
❌ EMI is an enhancement of the Wi-Fi signal that can be detected with a Wi-Fi adapter.  
❌ EMI is interference from devices working in different frequency bands and can be ignored.  
❌ EMI is a type of signal boost provided by certain appliances, detectable through standard Wi-Fi analysis.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Enhancement of Wi-Fi signal* — EMI is a disturbance, not a boost. Think of it like static interrupting a radio broadcast.  
- ❌ *Different frequency bands can be ignored* — Interference matters *within* the same band (e.g., 2.4GHz). Cross-band noise usually doesn’t cause EMI in this context.  
- ❌ *Signal boost from appliances* — That’s just marketing hype. EMI comes from *unintended* emitters like microwaves, not helpful ones.  
- ✅ *Same frequency band* — Exactly. EMI is most disruptive when it overlaps the same spectrum as your Wi-Fi.

# QUESTION 4  
What type of interference occurs when access points are configured to use overlapping channels, such as channels 1 and 3 in the 2.4 GHz band?

✅ Adjacent channel interference  
❌ Co-channel interference  
❌ Frequency modulation interference  
❌ Direct sequence interference  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Co-channel interference* — That happens when multiple APs use the **same** channel, not overlapping ones. It’s a coordination issue, not a collision.  
- ❌ *Frequency modulation interference* — FM is a method of modulation, not a common cause of channel-based interference in Wi-Fi.  
- ❌ *Direct sequence interference* — This is a spread-spectrum technique used to reduce interference, not a type of interference.  
- ✅ *Adjacent channel interference* — Right on. Using channels like 1 and 3 (which **overlap**) causes data collisions and degraded performance.

# QUESTION 5  
What can cause a loss of power/signal strength in a wireless network?

✅ Free space path loss and interference  
❌ Using a Wi-Fi analyzer  
❌ Decreasing the distance between devices  
❌ Upgrading network hardware  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Using a Wi-Fi analyzer* — That’s a diagnostic tool, not something that affects signal strength.  
- ❌ *Decreasing the distance between devices* — That **improves** signal strength, not weakens it.  
- ❌ *Upgrading network hardware* — This usually improves performance and coverage.  
- ✅ *Free space path loss and interference* — Spot on. As distance increases or obstacles/interference come into play, signal power drops.

# QUESTION 6  
What is the recommended AP power setting relative to the weakest client power?

✅ 2/3rds of the weakest client power  
❌ Equal to the weakest client power  
❌ Twice the weakest client power  
❌ Half of the weakest client power  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Equal to the weakest client power* — Sounds fair, but it can still lead to imbalance; the AP may “hear” clients it can’t talk to efficiently.  
- ❌ *Twice the weakest client power* — Overkill. That increases the chance of one-way communication issues.  
- ❌ *Half of the weakest client power* — Too low. Clients might not even hear the AP.  
- ✅ *2/3rds of the weakest client power* — This helps balance the communication range and minimizes the chance of clients being heard by the AP but not able to reply (one-way talk = bad).

# QUESTION 7  
What role does a controller play in managing overcapacity in an enterprise Wi-Fi solution?

❌ It assigns static IP addresses to all clients to manage connections better.  
❌ It increases the Wi-Fi signal strength automatically.  
❌ It physically cools down the APs to prevent overheating.  
✅ It provides reporting tools to diagnose bandwidth issues.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Static IP assignment* — That's a network admin function, not a controller’s core role for overcapacity.  
- ❌ *Signal strength increase* — Not the controller’s job. APs may adjust power, but controllers don’t directly boost Wi-Fi strength for overcapacity mitigation.  
- ❌ *Cooling down APs* — That’s pure hardware maintenance, not something a controller handles.

🧱 Controllers are the **brains** of an enterprise Wi-Fi system — they gather diagnostic data (bandwidth usage, channel load, AP performance), helping admins **make informed decisions** to manage load and optimize coverage.

# QUESTION 8  
What is a common method to dynamically manage network load and reduce overutilization in a wireless network facing overcapacity issues?

✅ Reassigning wireless channels dynamically  
❌ Reducing the encryption level of the network  
❌ Deploying additional DHCP servers  
❌ Increasing the AP's transmit power  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Reducing encryption* — That’s a security compromise, not a load-management strategy. It won’t help with overutilization.  
- ❌ *Extra DHCP servers* — Doesn’t solve congestion. That’s IP address distribution, not RF spectrum balancing.  
- ❌ *Boosting transmit power* — Can **worsen** the problem by causing more interference. Not the move in dense environments.  
- ✅ *Dynamic channel reassignment* — This is how controllers balance interference and spread clients across less congested frequencies. It’s smart, automated, and effective.

# QUESTION 9  
Why is it important to consider the band (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) that client devices support when addressing wireless coverage issues?

✅ Client devices that only support 2.4 GHz cannot connect to a 5 GHz network.  
❌ 2.4 GHz signals cannot penetrate walls or other physical barriers.  
❌ The band determines the maximum speed of the internet connection.  
❌ 5 GHz devices consume more power, leading to higher electricity costs.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *2.4 GHz can’t penetrate walls* — False. 2.4 GHz **penetrates better** than 5 GHz due to lower frequency.  
- ❌ *Speed of internet is determined by band* — Internet speed is limited by your **ISP plan**, not Wi-Fi band. The band affects **local throughput**, not WAN speed.  
- ❌ *Power consumption and electricity costs* — Wi-Fi radios are low-power. Any difference is negligible, and this isn’t a factor in planning.  
- ✅ *Band compatibility* — A 2.4 GHz-only device simply won’t see a 5 GHz network. That’s a hard limit you must consider.

# QUESTION 10  
What is the inverse-square rule in the context of wireless signals?

✅ Doubling the distance between devices reduces the signal strength by a factor of four  
❌ Doubling the distance between devices quadruples the signal strength  
❌ Doubling the distance between devices halves the signal strength  
❌ Doubling the distance between devices doubles the signal strength

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Quadruples the signal strength* — Opposite of the rule. The signal gets weaker, not stronger.  
- ❌ *Halves the signal strength* — That would be **inverse-linear**, not inverse-square.  
- ❌ *Doubles the signal strength* — Also false; moving away does not increase signal strength.

🧠 The **inverse-square law** says that power decreases with the square of the distance.  
So if distance = 2x, then signal = 1/(2²) = 1/4.

# QUESTION 11  
Aside from interference, what could signal problems also be a result of?

❌ The use of outdated encryption protocols  
❌ Excessive bandwidth usage by a single device  
❌ A malfunctioning Wi-Fi adapter in the client device  
✅ An attack on the network by making clients connect to a rogue AP  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Outdated encryption* — That’s a security risk, but it doesn’t impact signal quality directly.  
- ❌ *Bandwidth hogs* — Can slow the network, but they don’t mess with signal strength or availability.  
- ❌ *Bad Wi-Fi adapter* — Might affect *one* device, not widespread signal issues.

🧱 Rogue APs and deauth attacks can trick devices into associating with malicious APs, causing mass **disconnections** or degraded service — a classic **wireless attack vector**.

# QUESTION 12  
What is throughput in the context of wireless networks?

✅ The amount of data transferred at the network layer  
❌ The speed of the network's encryption algorithm  
❌ The latency of the network  
❌ The maximum data rate supported by the network standard

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Encryption speed* — That affects **security processing**, not raw data flow.  
- ❌ *Latency* — That’s **delay**, not throughput. You can have low latency and low throughput.  
- ❌ *Max data rate* — That’s **theoretical bandwidth**, not actual data moved. Throughput measures **real-world performance**.

🧱 Throughput = how much data actually makes it across the network in a given time, after overhead, collisions, and congestion are factored in.

# QUESTION 13  
In a complex environment, why might it be necessary to adjust the power level used by an access point on a given channel? (Select two.)

✅ To prevent the access point from interfering with other cells  
✅ To ensure clients can communicate effectively  
❌ To ensure the access point can interfere with other cells  
❌ To increase the number of devices that can connect to the access point  
❌ To decrease the security level of the network  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *"To interfere with other cells"* — That’s the **opposite** of good network design. Interference reduces performance.  
- ❌ *"To increase device count"* — Boosting power doesn’t increase **capacity**; that’s handled by bandwidth and infrastructure, not raw signal.  
- ❌ *"To decrease security"* — Power settings don’t affect encryption or auth; it’s unrelated to **network security**.

🧱 AP power adjustments = **coverage control**. It’s all about ensuring clients stay connected and avoiding overlap noise from neighboring APs.

---
# QUESTION 14  
What is the primary purpose of analyzing access point association times for client devices?

✅ To identify issues with roaming  
❌ To determine the optimal placement for new access points  
❌ To assess the security level of the wireless network  
❌ To calculate the total data usage of each client  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Optimal AP placement* — While signal timing *might* hint at this, association times specifically reflect client-to-AP transitions, not coverage zones.  
- ❌ *Security level* — Association time data doesn’t tell you if encryption is strong or if auth is weak.  
- ❌ *Client data usage* — Throughput or traffic analysis would give that, not association durations.

🔍 When a client hops from one AP to another and takes too long to reconnect, that’s a *roaming issue*. Slow transitions = dropped calls, lag spikes, and annoyed users.

---
# QUESTION 15  
What is a legitimate reason for a client to disassociate but not deauthenticate from an AP?

✅ The client is roaming in an extended service area.  
❌ The client is updating its firmware.  
❌ The client is shutting down.  
❌ The client is performing a security scan.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ *Firmware update* — Usually triggers a full disconnect, including deauthentication, to avoid interference.  
- ❌ *Shutting down* — Device power-off causes both disassociation and deauthentication to cleanly end the session.  
- ❌ *Security scan* — Scanning doesn’t require disassociation; many tools run scans while still connected.

🧱 **Roaming** between APs within the same ESS (Extended Service Set) involves a *disassociation* from one AP to reassociate with another — but the client remains authenticated to the network as a whole. That’s fast and seamless.
