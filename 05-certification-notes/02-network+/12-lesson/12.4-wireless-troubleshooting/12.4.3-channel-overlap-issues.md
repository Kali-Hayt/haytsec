## 12.4.3 – Channel Overlap Issues

### 📡 What is it?
Channel overlap = interference caused by **multiple APs using the same or nearby channels** within each other’s range.

There are **two types** of interference:

---

### 🔄 Co-Channel Interference (CCI)
- Occurs when **multiple devices share the same channel**.
- All must contend to transmit → CSMA/CA delays.
- Treated like a single **collision domain**.
- Measured as **channel utilization %**:
  - Use Wi-Fi analyzer or AP stats.
  - 📈 **Design goal**: channel utilization should stay **below 50%**.

---

### 🚫 Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI)
- Happens when APs use **different but overlapping channels**, like 1 & 3 on 2.4GHz.
- Causes more interference than CCI!
- Slows down CSMA/CA process and increases noise.

---

### 🎯 Design Goal for Multi-AP Networks
- Minimize overlap by spacing channels **at least 25 MHz** apart.
- On 2.4GHz, you can safely use **only 3 non-overlapping channels**:
  - ✅ Channel 1
  - ✅ Channel 6
  - ✅ Channel 11
- Example:
  - AP1 → Channel 1
  - AP2 → Channel 6
  - AP3 → Channel 11

🛡 Use 5GHz band (802.11a/n/ac/ax) to unlock **more non-overlapping channels**.

---

### ⚙️ Power Adjustment in Complex Environments

- Maxing out AP power can cause:
  - Signal **bleed** into neighboring cells (interference)
  - Client mismatch (can "hear" AP but not reply back)

**Best practice:**
- Adjust AP transmit power per environment.
- Ensure clients can **both hear and respond** to the AP.

---

## TL;DR Summary

- CCI = same channel → devices fight to speak.
- ACI = overlapping channels → noisy chaos.
- Use channels 1/6/11 on 2.4GHz only.
- Keep channel utilization < 50%.
- Power imbalance = clients can’t talk back → dropped connections.
