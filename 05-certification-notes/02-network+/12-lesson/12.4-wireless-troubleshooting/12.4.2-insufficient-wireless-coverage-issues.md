## 12.4.2 – Insufficient Wireless Coverage Issues

### 📶 What is it?
Insufficient coverage = areas in a building with weak or no Wi-Fi signal.  
- If interference can't be reduced or signal can't be boosted — install another device (AP, range extender, or wireless bridge).
- If you can't run cable to support a new AP, a **wireless bridge** may be needed.

## 📍 Antenna Placement

Incorrect placement can worsen attenuation & interference.

- **Site survey + heat map** helps optimize:
  - AP location
  - Antenna angle (if adjustable)

- **Wrong antenna type = weak signal**
  - 🧭 **Unidirectional** antennas: only good for point-to-point links.
  - 🔄 **Omnidirectional** (like doughnut radiation): general client access.

🛠 Example:
- Ceiling-mount AP → cone-shaped downward signal.
- Desktop AP → doughnut-shaped spread.

📚 Always check the manufacturer’s documentation or use survey software.

## 📉 Antenna Cable Attenuation

Connecting the antenna via coax cabling introduces signal loss:
- Known as **antenna cable attenuation**
- Loss values:
  - LMR/HDF/CFD 200: ~0.6 dB/m
  - LMR 400: ~0.22 dB/m
  - Connector loss: ~0.15 dB

🔧 **Important Tip:**  
If device has removable antennas, ensure they're **screwed in firmly**!  
Loose antennas = reduced range or total failure.

## 📡 EIRP – Effective Isotropic Radiated Power

**EIRP formula:**  
Transmit Power - Cable Loss + Antenna Gain = EIRP

**Example:**
15 dBm (Tx) - 1 dB (loss) + 6 dBi (gain) = 20 dBm (100 mW)

- AP/controller software shows EIRP for each radio.
- Must respect local/regional regulatory limits!
- Limits differ for:
  - 🔁 2.4GHz vs 5GHz
  - 🧩 Point-to-multipoint vs point-to-point setups

## ❌ The Myth of "More Power = Better"

⚠️ **Cranking transmit power ≠ better coverage!**

Why?
- AP may blast signal at 23 dBm…
- …but smartphone clients usually max out at 10–14 dBm.
- Clients detect the strong signal and try to use a high data rate…
- …but can’t send strong signal back = **packet loss & high error rate**

✅ **Rule of Thumb:**  
**AP power should be 2/3 of weakest client’s output**  
> If client = 14 dBm, AP = ~9–10 dBm

## TL;DR Summary

- Dead zones? Add an AP, bridge, or extender — don’t rely on power boosts.
- Antenna placement matters. So does type. Use heat maps + site surveys.
- Cable + connector = real signal loss (budget it in).
- EIRP = transmit power math. Keep it legal.
- Power imbalance = errors. Always plan for **two-way** comms!
