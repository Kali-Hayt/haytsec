## 12.1.4 – IEEE 802.11n, MIMO, and Channel Bonding

### 🧱 What is 802.11n?

- Introduced **major performance upgrades** to Wi-Fi.
- Works on both:
  - **2.4 GHz** and
  - **5 GHz** bands.
- Introduced two major technologies:
  - ✅ **MIMO** (Multiple Input Multiple Output)
  - ✅ **Channel Bonding**

---

## 📡 MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)

- Uses **multiple antennas** for transmission and reception.
- Boosts bandwidth by sending **multiple data streams** simultaneously.
- Configuration format: **AxB:C**
  - A = Transmit antennas
  - B = Receive antennas
  - C = Spatial streams
  - Example: `4x4:4` = 4 TX, 4 RX, 4 simultaneous data streams

### 🎯 Types of MIMO usage:

#### 1. ✅ Spatial Multiplexing
- Multiple antennas send **different data** → higher total throughput.

#### 2. ✅ Spatial Diversity
- Multiple antennas send **redundant data** → improves **signal strength & reliability**
- Same data from different paths = better reception in noisy environments.

## 🧬 Channel Bonding

- Allows combining two adjacent **20 MHz** channels into one **40 MHz** channel.
- Doubles potential bandwidth.
- Works better in **5 GHz** band due to:
  - Less congestion
  - More non-overlapping channels
- In 2.4 GHz, bonding is limited because of:
  - Fewer available clean channels
  - Increased risk of interference

---

## ⚙️ Performance & Modes

- **Max data rate per stream**: 72 Mbps
- With 4 streams and 40 MHz bonding: **up to 600 Mbps**
  
### Modes of operation:

#### ✅ Greenfield Mode
- **Maximum speed**, but **not compatible** with older Wi-Fi devices.
- Drops all backward compatibility overhead.

#### ✅ Mixed Mode (HT Mixed Mode)
- Compatible with 802.11a/b/g
- Adds overhead to maintain compatibility (lower performance than Greenfield).

## 📶 Regulatory Impact

- 5 GHz band allows more bonding, but...
  - DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) must be used to avoid radar bands.
  - Channels aren’t always adjacent = limits bonding options
  - Local laws affect allowed channels and transmit power

---

## 🔄 Compatibility & Naming

- 802.11n devices are often **backward-compatible** with b/g/a
- 802.11n is now officially designated as **Wi-Fi 4**
