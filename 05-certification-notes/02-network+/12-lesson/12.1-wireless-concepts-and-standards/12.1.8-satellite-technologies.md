## 12.1.8 – Satellite Technologies

### 🛰️ Satellite Overview
- Satellite systems use **microwave dishes** aimed at **orbital satellites**.
- Can **relay signals** between sites or communicate directly.
- Common in **rural areas** where DSL/cable isn't available.
- Satellite internet often built off existing **satellite TV infrastructure**.

---

### 🛰️ Geostationary Orbital Satellite Internet Access
- Satellites placed in **high geostationary orbit**.
- Major **drawback**: high **latency** due to long distances.
- Example:
  - DSL = **10–20 ms RTT**
  - Satellite = **600–800 ms RTT**
- Impacts real-time uses: **VoIP, gaming, video conferencing**.
- Satellite remains **fixed** relative to Earth's surface → simpler dish alignment.

ℹ️ **RTT** = Round Trip Time = time for a signal to go out and return.

---

### 🛰️ Low Earth Orbital (LEO) Satellite Internet Access
- Uses a **constellation of moving satellites**.
- **Lower latency**: ~100–200 ms RTT.
- **Higher bandwidth**: ~70–100 Mbps.
- Dish uses **motorized tracking** or **phased array** to realign with passing satellites.
- Requires **clear sky view**; more complex but **better performance** than geostationary.

---

### 📍 Global Positioning System (GPS)
- GPS uses satellites to **triangulate** position.
- Devices use **orbital satellite signals** to calculate location.
- Most phones/laptops use **Assisted GPS (A-GPS)**:
  - Combines cell tower and GPS data for faster results.
  - Requires **cellular connection**.
- GPS operated by **US government**.
- Other systems:
  - 🇪🇺 **Galileo** (EU)
  - 🇷🇺 **GLONASS** (Russia)
  - 🇨🇳 **BeiDou** (China)
