## 12.1.5 – Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6

---

## ⚡ Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)

- **Band**: 5 GHz only (2.4 GHz is legacy fallback for g/n)
- **Modulation**: OFDM with **Very High Throughput (VHT)**
- **Goal**: Achieve speeds like Gigabit Ethernet
- **Max channel width**: ✅ 80 MHz, ✅ 160 MHz (wider than Wi-Fi 4)
- **Spatial streams**: Up to **8**
- **Legacy compatibility**: Yes (works with 802.11n/g)

### 💡 Real-World Labels (AC naming)
- Example: `AC5300` = combined max speeds across radios
  - 1000 Mbps on 2.4 GHz (40 MHz channel)
  - 2 × 2167 Mbps streams on 5 GHz (80 MHz bonded channels)

✅ Designed for speed  
❌ Less efficient in dense environments

## 🚀 Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)

- **Bands**: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and now **6 GHz** (Wi-Fi 6E)
- **Modulation**: Enhanced OFDM with **High Efficiency (HE)**
- **Throughput gain**: ~40% more per packet (due to encoding efficiency)
- **Aim**: Support ~10 Gbps class connections (e.g., `AX11000`)
- **Labeling**: `AX6000` = 1,148 Mbps on 2.4 GHz + 4,804 Mbps on 5 GHz

### 🔁 OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)

- Breaks a channel into **Resource Units (RUs)**
- Each RU = mini-subcarrier for **parallel communication**
- Reduces latency, especially for:
  - ✅ IoT devices
  - ✅ Small, bursty packets
- **RUs** can be:
  - Assigned to more users = efficiency
  - Dynamically sized = QoS optimization (e.g., VoIP, video)

✅ Great for dense homes, IoT, enterprise  
✅ Works with Wi-Fi 4 and 5 clients  
✅ Improves battery life on mobile devices  
❌ High-speed claims require clean spectrum and 6 GHz support (Wi-Fi 6E)
