## 12.2.7 – Other Wireless Network Types

### 🧱 Ad Hoc Topology

- No access point (AP) required.
- Clients connect **directly** to each other (peer-to-peer).
- Known as **Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)** in 802.11 docs.
- All devices must be **within range** of each other.

> ⚠️ Not scalable. Suited for:
> - Small workgroups
> - Sharing a printer
> - Temporary networks

#### ❌ Modern Limitation:
- **IBSS** is deprecated in recent Windows versions (WDI drivers).
- Replaced by **Wi-Fi Direct**, which allows limited AP-like functionality (e.g., print jobs).

---

### 🧱 Mesh Topology

- Defined in **802.11s** as **Wireless Mesh Network (WMN)**.
- Devices (mesh stations) discover each other and form:
  - **Mesh Basic Service Set (MBSS)**
  - Paths via **routing protocols**, e.g., **HWMP** (Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol)
- Nodes **relay** data, don’t need direct radio line of sight.

> 🧠 More scalable than ad hoc—perfect for large coverage or **IoT networks**.

---

### 🧱 Point-to-Point (P2P)

- Creates a **direct link** between two locations/devices.
- Used when **wired cabling isn’t possible**.
- Example:
  - Connect two buildings using **directional antennas** (e.g., Yagi or dish)
  - Antennas must be **precisely aligned**
  - APs often set to **bridge mode**

> 🎯 Ideal for **long-range** connections between two fixed points.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Type | Description | AP Required | Use Case |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **IBSS (Ad Hoc)** | Peer-to-peer; no AP | ❌ | Temporary, small groups |
| **WMN (Mesh)** | Multi-hop, self-healing mesh | Optional | IoT, smart cities |
| **Point-to-Point** | Direct link between 2 sites | ✅ (in bridge mode) | Bridging buildings |
