## 12.2.1 ‚Äì Infrastructure Network Type

### üß± Data Link Layer (Wi-Fi)

- Wi-Fi uses similar framing and MAC addressing as Ethernet.
- Each radio (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) has a **unique MAC address** (assigned by vendor).
- A **station** is any device with a Wi-Fi radio (like a laptop or phone).

> üîç A dual-band adapter has **two MACs**: one for 2.4 GHz, one for 5 GHz.

---

### üß± SSID (Service Set Identifier)

- **SSID** = network name (max 32 bytes).
- Composed of ASCII characters, digits, `-` and `_`.
- **Broadcast SSID** = visible in network list.
- **Hidden SSID** = must be typed manually.
- When connecting:
  - The station sends a probe.
  - The AP responds with supported standards and security requirements.
  - Client authenticates and associates with the AP.

> üì° Think of SSID like the ‚Äústorefront sign‚Äù of a Wi-Fi network.

---

### üß± Infrastructure Network Topology

- The **default for most Wi-Fi networks**.
- Devices (stations) connect to an **Access Point (AP)**.
- The AP forms a **star topology** and mediates traffic.
- Each station must support the AP‚Äôs standards (e.g., 802.11ac).
- The communication uses a **specific channel and frequency**.

> üß† Think of the AP as a **traffic cop**, directing packets between clients.

---

### üß± BSS and BSSID

- **Basic Service Set (BSS)** = one AP + its connected stations.
- **BSSID** = MAC address (virtual) for the AP radio serving that BSS.
- One AP can run multiple BSSs using different:
  - Frequencies (2.4, 5, 6 GHz)
  - Channels
  - SSIDs

> üì° BSSID is the **fingerprint** of a specific AP radio.

---

### üß± Signal Selection

- If an SSID has **multiple BSSIDs**, the client picks the **best signal**.
- Example:
  - You name both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands "HomeWiFi"
  - Your phone auto-picks the strongest BSSID for that SSID.

---

### üß± Distribution System (DS)

- APs can bridge **wireless clients** to **wired infrastructure**.
- This wired portion = **Distribution System (DS)**.
- Usually, APs plug into Ethernet switches.
- DS lets you **network multiple APs**.

> üîå DS is the backbone‚Äîthe cables behind the scenes that tie it all together.

---

### üß± ESS and ESSID

- **Extended Service Set (ESS)** = group of BSSs sharing:
  - Same SSID
  - Same security configuration
- **ESSID** = network name for the ESS (same format as SSID)

> üß† Think of ESS as ‚Äúmultiple Wi-Fi routers under one name,‚Äù giving seamless roaming across large spaces (like campuses or offices).

---

### ‚úÖ Recap

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **SSID** | Network name shown to users |
| **BSS** | Single AP + clients |
| **BSSID** | AP's MAC address per radio |
| **DS** | Wired backhaul connecting APs |
| **ESS** | Multiple BSSs, same SSID/security |
| **ESSID** | Network name of an ESS (same as SSID) |
