# 12.2.9 Lab: Design an Outdoor Wireless Network

## ðŸ§± Scenario

You are a network technician for a small corporate network. Youâ€™ve been asked to create a network connection between buildings A and B. A wireless connection between the two buildings is the chosen solution.

Additionally, employees have reported poor wireless signal on the patios of both buildings. A wireless site survey confirms weak coverage in these areas.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task

- Install high-gain directional antennae on each buildingâ€™s roof to create a fast point-to-point connection.
- Install appropriate outdoor wireless access points (WAPs).
- Provide signal coverage to patio areas without unnecessary signal bleed.

## âœ… Required Actions

- âœ… Install **high-gain directional antennae** on the **roofs of Buildings A and B**.
- âœ… Install **outdoor wireless access points** on each buildingâ€™s roof.
- âœ… Attach **WAP directional antennas** to provide signal to **Patio A** and **Patio B** respectively.

## ðŸ”§ Steps to Complete

1. **Install High-Gain Antennas (Directional)**
   - Go to **Shelf > High-gain Antennas**
   - Drag one to the roof of **Building A**
   - Drag the second to the roof of **Building B**

2. **Install Outdoor Wireless Access Points**
   - Go to **Shelf > Wireless Access Points**
   - Drag one to the roof of **Building A**
   - Drag another to the roof of **Building B**

3. **Attach WAP Directional Antennas**
   - Go to **Shelf > WAP Antennas**
   - Attach a **Directional Antenna** to each installed outdoor WAP (facing each respective patio)

## ðŸ“ˆ Result

- **Score**: 100%
- **Time Spent**: 04:14

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **High-Gain Directional Antennas** focus signal like a flashlight beamâ€”ideal for linking two distant points without unnecessary radiation.
- **WAP Antennas (Directional)** ensure signal is focused only where needed (the patios), avoiding signal spill to nearby buildings.
- **Wireless bridges** using rooftop WAPs + high-gain directional antennas are perfect for building-to-building communication.
