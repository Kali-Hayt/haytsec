## 12.2.6 â€“ Antenna Types

### ðŸ§± Antenna Type and Propagation Pattern

- **Antenna type** affects the **shape** of the signal radiation pattern.
- Most Wi-Fi radios use **omnidirectional vertical rod antennas**.

---

### ðŸ§­ Omnidirectional Antennas

- Broadcast **in all directions**, mostly horizontally.
- Ideal for broad coverage (e.g., central ceiling-mount APs).
- Radiation pattern = **donut (torus)** shape:
  - Horizontal = strong signal
  - Vertical = weaker
- Placing them **above head height**:
  - Avoids obstruction (like furniture)
  - Too high (above 25 ft) = signal loss below antenna
- Some APs offer **downtilt omnidirectional** designs for high ceilings.

> ðŸ§  Think of omnidirectional as **a light bulb** radiating outward.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Unidirectional Antennas

- **Focused** signal in one direction only.
- Both sender and receiver must use directional antennas to communicate.
- Common types:
  - **Yagi**: bar with fins
  - **Parabolic**: dish or grid
- Useful for:
  - **Point-to-point links**
  - Bridging buildings or long-distance wireless hops

> ðŸŽ¯ Like a flashlight beamâ€”stronger but only where aimed.

### ðŸ“ˆ Gain and Beamwidth

- **Gain** = how much stronger the signal is (measured in **dBi**)
  - Higher dBi = **narrower** beam
- **Beamwidth** = angle of signal spread (in degrees)
  - Narrow beam = more directional, longer range
  - Wide beam = less directional, more forgiving

> Example:
```
10Â° beam = very focused, long range, precise alignment
90Â° beam = wider spread, easier to align
```

---

### ðŸŒ€ Polarization

- Describes the **orientation** of the wave:
  - **Vertical polarization** = antenna rod is upright
  - **Horizontal polarization** = rod is parallel to the floor
- Transmitter and receiver should use **same polarization** for best signal.
- **Dual-polarized** antennas:
  - Can operate in either mode
  - Ideal for mobile clients (devices may tilt in any direction)

> ðŸ“¡ Mismatched polarization = signal loss, like two walkie-talkies facing opposite directions.

### âœ… Summary Table

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Omnidirectional Antenna** | Broadcasts in 360Â° (horizontal donut pattern) |
| **Unidirectional Antenna** | Focuses signal in one direction (point-to-point) |
| **Yagi** | Directional antenna with rod & fins |
| **Parabolic** | Directional dish or grid antenna |
| **Gain (dBi)** | Signal strength boost due to focus |
| **Beamwidth** | Angle of signal spread (degrees) |
| **Polarization** | Orientation of wave (vertical/horizontal) |
| **Dual-polarized** | Supports both orientations |
