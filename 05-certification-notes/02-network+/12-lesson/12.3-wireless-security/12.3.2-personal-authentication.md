## 12.3.2 – Personal Authentication

### 🔐 What Is Personal Authentication?
- Confirms only **valid users** connect to the network
- Part of three main Wi-Fi auth types:
  - ✅ Personal (PSK/SAE)
  - ❌ Open (no authentication)
  - 🏢 Enterprise (e.g., RADIUS)

Within **Personal**, there are two methods:
- **WPA2-PSK (Pre-Shared Key)**
- **WPA3-SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)**

### 🔑 WPA2 Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication

- Uses a shared **passphrase** to generate the encryption key
- Also called **group authentication**
- Passphrase (8–63 characters) is hashed to form:
  - 🧱 **PMK** (Pairwise Master Key)
- PMK is used in WPA2’s **four-way handshake** to generate session keys
- Same secret must be on:
  - The access point
  - Every connecting client

#### ❌ Security Concerns
- Vulnerable to **offline dictionary attacks** if the passphrase is weak
- 🔐 Recommended: minimum 14-character passphrase to reduce cracking risk

---

### ✅ WPA3 Personal Authentication (SAE)

- Still uses a passphrase, **but not to directly derive encryption keys**
- Uses:
  - 🔁 **Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)**
  - 🔐 **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)** replaces PSK
- Stronger resistance to offline attacks
- Offers **forward secrecy** — session keys stay private even if password leaks later

### 📝 Note on Configuration Labels
- You may see different labels on routers/APs:
  - `WPA2-Personal` = WPA2-PSK
  - `WPA3-Personal` = WPA3-SAE
- Some access points support **WPA3-Transition Mode**:
  - Allows WPA2 and WPA3 clients to coexist
