## 12.3.4 ‚Äì Guest Networks and Captive Portals

### üåê Open Authentication

- Open auth = no password required to join
- With **WPA2**, traffic is unencrypted
- With **WPA3**, **Wi-Fi Enhanced Open** provides encryption for open networks

---

### üß≥ Guest Network Setup

- Used in:
  - Public hotspots
  - Private networks with guest access (e.g., offices)
- Best practice:
  - Use **separate SSIDs** for guests and employees
  - **Segment traffic** between networks
  - Restrict guest access to **Internet only**, not LAN resources

---

### üß† Captive Portals

- A **browser-based login page** used with open authentication
- After joining network, user is redirected to a **captive portal**
- Used to:
  - Authenticate access
  - Enforce Terms of Service
  - Collect payments or user agreements
- Usually secured with **HTTPS**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Captive Portal Cautions

- Redirect issues if portal doesn‚Äôt use **TLS (HTTPS)**
- Browsers may **block non-secure redirects**
- Captive portals should use:
  - HTTPS with a **valid certificate**
  - Certificate signed by a **trusted CA**

---

### üîê Staying Secure on Open Wi-Fi

- Use **HTTPS** websites only
- Use messaging/file-sharing services with **TLS enabled**
- Better: use a **VPN**
  - Tunnel encrypts traffic between device and VPN server
  - Prevents sniffing or interception on open Wi-Fi
- VPN options:
  - Company-provided VPN
  - Third-party VPN provider (‚ö†Ô∏è must be trusted)
- VPN should use **certificate-based tunneling** for secure inner authentication
