## 🧠 Lesson 3.2.4 – Ethernet Switch Types

### 📌 Overview
- Ethernet switches come in various models to meet different network needs.
- Basic models: 12–48 ports, limited expansion.
- Advanced models: support **high-speed interconnects**, **redundancy**, **modular upgrades**, **fiber optics**, and **management features**.
- Vendors include: **Cisco** (dominant), **HP Enterprise**, **Huawei**, **Juniper**, **Arista**, **Linksys**, **D-Link**, **NETGEAR**, and **NEC**.

### 🧰 Switch Categories

#### 🔹 Unmanaged vs. Managed
- **Unmanaged**: Plug-and-play, no configuration.
  - Common in SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) environments.
  - May be integrated into routers/modems.
- **Managed**: Configurable via console, web, or SNMP.
  - Used in corporate networks.
  - Supports VLANs, QoS, security policies, and port monitoring.
  - If left unconfigured, acts like an unmanaged switch.

#### 🔹 Stackable
- Switches that can be physically connected and **logically managed as one unit**.
- Ideal for scalable enterprise environments.

#### 🔹 Modular vs. Fixed
- **Fixed**: Set number and type of ports — non-expandable.
- **Modular**: Slots for plug-in cards — customizable port types and counts.
  - Ideal for large, growing networks.

#### 🔹 Desktop vs. Rack-Mounted
- **Desktop**: Small, free-standing units (5–8 ports), often unmanaged.
- **Rack-mounted**: Larger switches designed to fit 19" server racks.
  - Common in data centers and enterprise networks.

| **Managed**            | Configurable (CLI/web/SNMP), enterprise-grade features                      |
| **Stackable**          | Multiple switches function as one logical device                            |
| **Fixed**              | Static port layout, not expandable                                          |
| **Modular**            | Upgradeable via port cards                                                  |
| **Desktop**            | Small switches for home/desk use                                            |
| **Rack-mounted**       | Full-size switches for network/server racks                                 |

### 🧠 Analogy
> Choosing a switch type is like picking the right tool for the job — you don’t bring a toolbox (modular) to hang a single picture frame (desktop switch).
