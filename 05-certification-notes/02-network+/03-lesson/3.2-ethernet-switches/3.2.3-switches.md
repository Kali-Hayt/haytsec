## 🧠 Lesson 3.2.3 – Switches

### 📌 What Is a Switch?
- A **Layer 2** device that replaces both **hubs** and **bridges**.
- Supports **Gigabit Ethernet** and faster – these can only be deployed using switches.
- Performs the same function as a bridge but with **more ports** and **greater control**.

---

### 🔧 How It Works
- Each **port is a separate collision domain**.
- Learns and stores **MAC addresses** for each connected device.
- Uses a **MAC address table** to forward traffic only where needed.
- Establishes **point-to-point full-duplex** connections between nodes.

---

### 🧠 Microsegmentation
- Each switch port operates as an isolated segment.
- This ensures no other devices share bandwidth or collision space on that link.
- This structure is called **microsegmentation**.
- Reduces collisions and increases speed and efficiency.

---

### ⚠️ Collision Handling
- Collisions can **only occur** if a port is operating in **half-duplex mode** (e.g., legacy NIC or hub).
- Even then, the collision is **contained** to that one segment.
- The rest of the network remains unaffected.

---

### 🌐 Broadcast Domains
- By default, **all switch ports share the same broadcast domain**.
- To segment broadcast traffic, switches must be configured with **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**.

---

### ✅ Summary
- 📍 **OSI Layer**: 2 (Data Link)
- 🧱 **Collision Domains**: 1 per port
- 🔁 **Duplex Mode**: Full-duplex supported
- 🧠 **MAC Table**: Learns and forwards intelligently
- 🌐 **Broadcast Domain**: Shared unless using VLANs
- 🚀 **Performance**: High-speed, low-latency

### 🧠 Analogy
> A switch is like giving each person in a call center their own private line, instead of sharing one loudspeaker. Everyone can talk at once without interference.
