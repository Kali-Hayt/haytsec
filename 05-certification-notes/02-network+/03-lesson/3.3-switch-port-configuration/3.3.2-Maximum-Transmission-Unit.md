## 3.3.2 ‚Äì Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)

- A **standard Ethernet frame** has a max size of **1,518 bytes** (excluding preamble).
- Each Ethernet frame includes an **18-byte header**:
  - 6 bytes = destination & source MAC addresses
  - 4 bytes = error checking
  - 2 bytes = EtherType field

- The **data payload** maxes out at **1,500 bytes** ‚Äî this is called the **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)**.

### üöÄ Jumbo Frames

- **Jumbo frame**: A frame that supports payloads up to **9,216 bytes**.
- Useful when large data needs to be sent ‚Äî reduces:
  - Frame count
  - Processing load on routers/switches
  - Overhead from extra frame headers

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Jumbo frame benefits are debated and not always consistent.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Notes

- **All devices on the path** (hosts, switches, routers) must support the same MTU.
- Complex setups (e.g., with **IPSec**) require accurate MTU calculation due to extra headers.
- Configure jumbo frames with command:
