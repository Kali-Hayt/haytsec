## 🔌 3.1.1 – Network Interface Cards (NICs)

### ✅ Definition:
A **Network Interface Card (NIC)** is the hardware that **physically connects** a host (computer, server, etc.) to a network.  
It’s also called a **network adapter** or **network interface controller**.

---

### 🔧 Core Functions:
- Hosts the **transceiver** that sends and receives signals over a medium (copper, fiber).
- Implements **Ethernet standards** (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet).
- Converts data between the host and the physical medium.

---

### 📡 Types of NICs:
- **Copper (RJ-45)** – Supports 1 Gbps (Gigabit) and up.
- **Fiber (SFP+, QSFP, etc.)** – Used for high-speed links (10 GbE, 40 GbE, or higher).
- **Wireless NICs** – Built-in or USB-based for Wi-Fi connections.
- **Virtual NICs** – Used in VMs or VPNs (e.g. `tun0` in Hack The Box).

---

### ⚙️ Features:
- **Multiple Ports** – A single NIC can have multiple connections for:
  - **Different networks**
  - **Link aggregation** (combine bandwidth)
- **Speed tiers**:
  - 1 GbE = Standard
  - 10/40 GbE = High-performance (comes with high cost)

---

### 💡 Real-World Use:
- Servers often use **multi-port NICs** for redundancy or speed.
- HTB often exposes NIC names like `eth0`, `tun0` — knowing what hardware/software lies behind them helps in enumeration and pivoting.
