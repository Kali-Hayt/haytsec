## 📉 3.1.4 – Transceiver Signal Strength Issues

### 🧠 Key Concept: Signal Loss in Fiber

Even though **fiber optic cables** experience less **attenuation** than copper, they still suffer **signal degradation** due to:
- Microscopic imperfections in the glass
- Surface smoothness variations
- Bending or poor splicing

---

### 📏 Optical Link Budget

- An **optical link budget** (aka **loss budget**) is the **total allowable signal loss** from the transmitter (Tx) to the receiver (Rx).
- It’s calculated during planning and tested after deployment.

---

### 📊 Loss Contributors

- **Attenuation**:
  - Signal loss per kilometer
  - Typical values:
    - **Single-mode**: up to **0.4 dB/km**
    - **Multimode**: **0.8–3 dB/km**

- **Connectors**:
  - Each connector adds ~**0.75 dB** of loss

- **Splices**:
  - **Mechanical splice**: ~**1 dB**
  - **Fusion splice**: ~**0.3 dB**

---

### 🔋 Power Budget

- Power budget = **Tx power – Rx sensitivity**
- Example:
  - Tx = -8 dBm, Rx = -15 dBm → Power budget = **7 dB**

---

### 📉 Budget Margin

- Margin = Power Budget – Loss Budget
- **Minimum recommended margin: 5 dB**
  - Adds tolerance for:
    - Bends, stress
    - Aging
    - Environmental conditions
    - Accidental repairs/splices

---

### 🧪 Example:

| Component           | Loss (dB)      |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 2 km Single-mode   | 0.8            |
| 2 connectors       | 1.5 (0.75 x 2) |
| 1 fusion splice    | 0.3            |
| **Total loss**     | **2.6 dB**     |

If Power Budget is **7 dB**, then Margin = 7 - 2.6 = **4.4 dB** → borderline acceptable.

---

### 📌 Real-World Relevance:
- Signal loss = slower speeds, intermittent links, or full failure
- Fiber testers are used to **verify performance**
- In HTB-style CTFs or ops, poor cabling could cause weird behaviors that mimic software bugs
