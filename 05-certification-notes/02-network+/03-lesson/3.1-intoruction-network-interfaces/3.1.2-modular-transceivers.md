## 🔄 3.1.2 – Modular Transceivers

### ✅ Definition:
Modular transceivers are **hot-swappable components** that allow networking gear (like switches, routers, and servers) to support different cable types (fiber or copper) **without replacing the entire device**.

---

### 🔧 Why Modular?
- Networks may use **multiple cabling types** (copper + fiber).
- Devices like switches and routers need to **terminate various cable/connector types**.
- Enterprise equipment uses **modular slots** to insert the transceiver needed for the job.

## 🔍 Transceiver Types

### 🔹 SFP / SFP+  
**SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable)**  
- Supports **Gigabit Ethernet**
- Uses **LC fiber connectors**
  
**SFP+ (Enhanced SFP)**  
- Supports **10 GbE**
- Still uses the same **LC form factor**

🧪 Example:  
- `10GBASE-SR` vs `10GBASE-LR` (short vs long-range fiber)

### 🔸 QSFP / QSFP+  
**QSFP (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable)**  
- Supports **4 × 1 Gbps links**  
- Can aggregate into **one 4 Gbps channel**

**QSFP+ (Enhanced QSFP)**  
- Supports **4 × 10 Gbps = 40 GbE**
- Uses **MPO (multi-fiber push-on)** connectors
- Can be used with **WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)**

🧠 Used for **high-bandwidth aggregation**, like data center uplinks or backbone links.

### 💡 Real-World & HTB:
- You might not touch QSFP/SFP directly in HTB, but knowing the **hardware limitations** (speed, media type) helps during **network assessments** and **hardware enumeration**.
- In pen tests, SFP info might show up in documentation or when reviewing physical security.
