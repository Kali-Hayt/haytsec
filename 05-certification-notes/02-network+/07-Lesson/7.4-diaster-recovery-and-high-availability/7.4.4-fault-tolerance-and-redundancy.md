## 7.4.4 Fault Tolerance and Redundancy  
#networking-plus #fault-tolerance #redundancy 

A strong network shouldn't need to switch to disaster recovery unless absolutely necessary. A **resilient network** should handle **routine faults** using built-in fault tolerance and redundancy.

### 🧱 Definitions

- **Fault** = Any event that causes a service to become unavailable.
- **Fault Tolerance** = The system keeps operating even if some components fail.
- **Redundancy** = Extra components/systems are ready to take over if one fails.

Each IT system uses assets: servers, switches, routers, disk arrays, power supplies. All can fail. We must measure how *reliable* these components are and ensure we can meet goals like **MTD**, **RTO**, and **RPO**.

### 🔢 Key Reliability Metrics (KPIs)

#### ✅ Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Used for **repairable components** (e.g., servers).
- Formula:  
  `MTBF = total operational time / number of failures`  
  Example: 10 devices run for 50 hours, 2 fail → MTBF = (10×50)/2 = 250 hours/failure

#### ✅ Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
- For **non-repairable components** (e.g., hard drives).
- Formula:  
  `MTTF = total operational time / number of devices`  
  Example: Two drives fail at 10 and 14 years → MTTF = (10+14)/2 = 12 years

#### ✅ Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
- Measures **how long it takes to fix** something and return to full function.
- Formula:  
  `MTTR = total repair time / number of incidents`
- Helps estimate whether **RTO** targets are realistic.

---

### 🧱 Why These Matter

- MTBF/MTTF help determine how much **redundancy** you need.
- MTTR helps estimate downtime and recovery planning.
- All feed into your **disaster recovery** and **resiliency** posture.

### 🔁 Fault-Tolerant System Design

A system is **fault tolerant** if it keeps delivering service despite component failures.

- Often uses **redundancy**:
  - Spare components
  - Alternate network paths
  - Power backups

Goal: Eliminate **single points of failure**.

### 🧰 Devices & Solutions That Support Fault Tolerance

- **Redundant spares**  
  Power supplies, NICs, RAID disks, cooling fans — ready to take over when the main fails.

- **Network links**  
  Multiple paths between switches/routers allow traffic rerouting if a cable/port fails.

- **UPS and standby power supplies**  
  Protect against full power loss or electrical instability (blackouts, brownouts).

- **Backup strategies**  
  Protect data, enable quick recovery.

- **Cluster services**  
  Multiple servers work as a single system. If one fails, another takes over seamlessly.

### 🧠 Summary

| KPI / Concept | Used For            | Measures                        |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| MTBF          | Repairable systems  | Avg time between failures        |
| MTTF          | Non-repairables     | Avg time until permanent failure |
| MTTR          | Repair timeline     | Avg time to fix/restore          |

- Fault tolerance = **keep running even during failures**.
- Redundancy = **have backups ready to go**.

These aren’t optional—they’re the backbone of any serious enterprise network.
