## 7.4.8 Lab: Configure NIC Teaming

You are the IT administrator for a small corporate network. You use **CorpServer** for your production server and need to maximize throughput. You must configure NIC teaming.

---

### ðŸ§ª Lab Objectives

- Connect the 4-port NIC to the switch.
- Configure Ethernet 3â€“6 as a NIC team called **NetTeam**.
- Use:
  - **Teaming mode:** `LACP`
  - **Load balancing mode:** `Address Hash`
  - **Standby adapter:** `None (all adapters Active)`
- Assign the NIC team to the **External** virtual switch using the **Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Driver**.
- Verify connectivity and speed in the **Network and Sharing Center**.

---

### ðŸ§± Steps Overview

1. **Move network cable** from onboard NIC to the 4-port NIC on CorpServer (port 22 on switch).
2. **Connect remaining 3 cables** from the 4-port NIC to switch ports 19, 20, 21.
3. **NIC Team Configuration:**
   - Name: `NetTeam`
   - Members: `Ethernet 3` through `Ethernet 6`
   - Teaming mode: `LACP`
   - Load balancing: `Address Hash`
   - Standby: `None`
4. **Assign NetTeam** to the **External** switch via Hyper-V Virtual Switch Manager.
5. **Verify connection:**
   - Connection status: `Connected`
   - Individual NIC speed: `1 Gbps`
   - Team NetTeam speed: `4 Gbps`

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

- NIC teaming combines multiple network connections for **redundancy and higher throughput**.
- `LACP` (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) dynamically manages team links.
- `Address Hash` balances traffic using a hash of MAC/IP/port info.
- No standby adapter = **all links active** (load balancing + failover).
- Always check **Network and Sharing Center** to confirm speed and connectivity.
