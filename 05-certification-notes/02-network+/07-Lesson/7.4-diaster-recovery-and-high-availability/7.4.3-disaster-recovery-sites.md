## 7.4.3 Disaster Recovery Sites
#networking-plus #disaterrecovery #hot-sides #cold-sides #warm-sites

Disaster recovery planning falls under business continuity planning and defines how to recover a system or site to a working state after disruption. Disasters can include:
- Loss of power
- Component failure
- Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes)
- Human threats (e.g., terrorism)

### 🔁 Redundancy and Failover

- Redundant devices or spare network links enable quick replacement if systems fail.
- **Spare sites** provide backup computing power at another location.
- In the event of failure, services **fail over** to this alternate site.
- The DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) should cover:
  - How failover is executed
  - Checks to confirm it succeeded
  - How to revert back once the primary site is restored

### 🏗️ Site Resiliency Types

Disaster recovery sites are categorized by readiness and cost:

#### 🔥 Hot Site
- Fully operational and ready to failover immediately.
- Owned by the organization or permanently reserved.
- Continuously updated with live data.
- Expensive, but minimizes downtime.

#### 🌡️ Warm Site
- Equipped with infrastructure, but **data must be restored** before it's usable.
- Not fully live, but faster to bring online than cold sites.

#### ❄️ Cold Site
- Essentially a shell: leased space without servers or systems pre-installed.
- Long setup time in a crisis.
- Cheapest to maintain, but slowest recovery.

### 💡 Real-World Strategy Considerations

- Leasing DR sites from service providers is expensive.
- In national emergencies, **demand will likely exceed supply**.
- Some businesses form **reciprocal arrangements** with partners for shared DR capability—cheap but complex to organize.

### ☁️ Cloud-Based DR

For most companies:
- The **cloud** is the most **cost-effective** DR solution.
- Cloud providers maintain **hot site-level redundancy**.
- Regional disasters don't affect service if backed by other regions.
