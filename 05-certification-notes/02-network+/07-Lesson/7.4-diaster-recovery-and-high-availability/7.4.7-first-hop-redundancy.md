## 7.4.7 First Hop Redundancy

In a full or partial mesh network topology, alternate routes can be found to bypass failed routers or faulty connections. However, end systems are typically served by a single router configured as the default gateway. While it's *possible* to configure hosts with multiple default gateways, this is not practical—it introduces complexity into host routing logic far beyond what most systems implement.

✅ Instead, **First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)** were developed to solve this.

### 🔁 Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)

- **Vendor**: Cisco (proprietary)
- Allows multiple physical routers to serve as a **single default gateway** for a subnet.
- Each router has:
  - A unique MAC address and IP address.
  - Configuration to **share a virtual IP** and **virtual MAC**.
- These routers form a **standby group**.
  - They use IP multicasts to communicate.
  - Administrator sets **priority levels** to determine which is active.
- **Failover behavior**:
  - Active router handles all traffic for the virtual IP.
  - If it fails, the router with the next highest priority takes over.

### 📶 Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)

- **Vendor**: Open standard (not Cisco-specific).
- Works like HSRP but with some differences:
  - The **active router is called the master**.
  - Other routers are **backup routers**.
  - All backups monitor the master.
- In the event of failure:
  - A new master is elected based on priority.
- **Advantages over HSRP**:
  - Doesn't require each router to have a unique IP.
  - Can be configured to share just the **virtual IP**.
  - Saves address space—ideal for subnets with limited IPs.

### 🧠 Summary

- ❗ End devices usually rely on **a single default gateway**.
- 💥 If that gateway fails, **FHRP ensures** there’s a standby router ready.
- 🧰 HSRP and VRRP offer similar functionality, but:
  - HSRP is Cisco-specific, stricter with IP assignments.
  - VRRP is more flexible and IP-space efficient.
