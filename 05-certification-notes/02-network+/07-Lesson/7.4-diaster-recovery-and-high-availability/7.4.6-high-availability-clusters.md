## 7.4.6 High Availability Clusters
#high-availability #clusters #netwokring-plus 

Where a load balancer spreads traffic across independent processing nodes, **clustering** allows those nodes to share data and support each other in case one fails.  

- If one node fails, connections **fail over** to another.
- To external clients, the cluster appears as a **single server**.

### 🧱 Virtual IP

To support failover between clustered systems:

- A **virtual IP** (shared or floating IP) is used to route traffic.
- Nodes communicate via a **private connection**, each with its own real IP.
- A **redundancy protocol** like **CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol)** handles:
  - Assigning the active node to “own” the virtual IP.
  - Using **heartbeat messages** to detect faults and promote the passive node when needed.

### 🔁 Active-Passive vs Active-Active Clustering

- **Active-Passive**
  - One node is active, the other is on standby.
  - ✅ Reliable, minimal performance hit on failover.
  - ❌ Higher cost due to unused capacity.

- **Active-Active**
  - All nodes actively process requests at once.
  - ✅ Efficient hardware usage and full performance.
  - ❌ During failover, remaining nodes must absorb more load—may reduce performance.
