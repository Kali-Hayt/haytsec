## 7.2.6 Network Attached Storage

- A **network attached storage (NAS)** appliance is a device dedicated to acting as a file server.
- NAS devices run custom OSs (usually Linux-based) and are often managed through web interfaces.
- Accessed by IP address or domain name.
- File access happens via standard protocols like:
  - ✅ SMB (Server Message Block)
  - ✅ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

### 🧱 RAID Support

- Most NAS systems support **RAID** (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):
  - Spreads data across disks.
  - ✅ Ensures data availability even if a disk fails.

### ❌ NAS Drawbacks

- Shares bandwidth with other network traffic.
- Can slow down the network if overloaded.
- Potential bottleneck if many users or large files are involved.

### ✅ Benefits

- Fast and easy way to add shared file storage to a network.
- Great for small to medium environments with sufficient bandwidth.
