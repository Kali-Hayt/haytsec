## 7.2.4 Secure File Transfer Protocol  
#networking-plus

### üõ°Ô∏è SFTP (Secure FTP)
- Uses **SSH over TCP port 22** to secure FTP communication.
- Encrypts both **authentication** and **data transfer** between client and server.
- Standard FTP commands are reused but tunneled over SSH.
- ‚úÖ Prevents eavesdropping.
- ‚ùó Requires an SSH server that supports SFTP and client software that supports it.

### üß± FTPS ‚Äì FTP over SSL/TLS

#### **Explicit TLS (FTPES)**
- Uses the `AUTH TLS` command to **upgrade** an existing insecure connection over **TCP port 21** to a secure one.
- After upgrading, authentication and data transfers are encrypted.
- More firewall-friendly (preferred over FTPS).

#### **Implicit TLS (FTPS)**
- SSL/TLS tunnel is **negotiated at the start**, before any FTP command is issued.
- Uses **TCP port 990** for control connection.
- Less flexible; tends to have **more firewall issues**.

### ‚úÖ Summary
- **SFTP** = SSH-based, uses port 22.
- **FTPES** = Explicit TLS, starts unsecure on port 21 then upgraded.
- **FTPS** = Implicit TLS, always secure, uses port 990.
- **FTPES** is typically preferred when firewall traversal is needed.
