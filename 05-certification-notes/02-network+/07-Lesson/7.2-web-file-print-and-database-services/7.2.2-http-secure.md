## 7.2.2 HTTP Secure #networking-plus

### ‚úÖ What is HTTPS?

- HTTPS stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure**.
- It‚Äôs HTTP layered with **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** for encryption.
- Used to protect data in transit from eavesdropping or tampering.

### üß± How It Works

- HTTPS uses **TCP port 443** (instead of port 80 used by HTTP).
- The browser initiates a **TLS handshake** with the server.
- Once the handshake completes, encrypted HTTP traffic begins.

### üîí Browser Behavior

- Browsers (e.g., Firefox) display a **padlock icon** in the address bar when HTTPS is active.
- Clicking the padlock reveals:
  - **Certificate Authority (CA)** that issued the certificate.
  - **Encryption details**, expiration, and domain match.
- If HTTPS is misconfigured or absent, browsers may:
  - Show **warnings**.
  - **Block the page** (depending on settings and policies).

### ‚ùå Why HTTP is a Problem

- HTTP is **plaintext**‚Äîanyone can read or tamper with the data.
- No protection for:
  - Login forms
  - Cookies
  - URLs
  - Session data
- HTTPS solves this by **encrypting the entire session**.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of HTTPS

- Encrypts user data (privacy).
- Ensures server **authenticity** (via certificates).
- Allows **secure login and session management**.
- Boosts SEO and browser trust.
