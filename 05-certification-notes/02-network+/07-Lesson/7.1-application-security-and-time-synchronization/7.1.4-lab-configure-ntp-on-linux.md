#networking-plus #lab #ntp

---

### Objective  
Configure CorpData (Linux) as an NTP server and sync time from Exec (Windows).

---

### Steps

#### On CorpData (Linux):
1. Install the NTP service:
   dnf install ntp  
   *(No `-y` flag needed — system prompts for confirmation)*

2. Verify the NTP service is running:
   systemctl status ntp  
   ✅ Output: `Active (running)`

3. Find the NTP server's IP address:
   ip addr show | more  
   ✅ Found: `192.168.0.22`

4. Q1: What is the status of the NTP service?  
   ✅ Answer: `Active (running)`

5. Q2: What is the IP address for the NTP server?  
   ✅ Answer: `192.168.0.22`

---

#### On Exec (Windows):
1. Open Terminal (Admin)
   - Right-click Start → Terminal (Admin)

2. Add the NTP server as a manual source:
   w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:192.168.0.22,0x8 /syncfromflags:MANUAL /update

3. Verify synchronization:
   w32tm /query /status  
   ✅ Output includes:
   - Stratum: 2 (secondary reference – synced by SNTP)
   - Source: 192.168.0.22
   - Last Successful Sync Time: (timestamp)
