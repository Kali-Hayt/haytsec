### 📞 Overview

Modern networks are replacing traditional voice systems with **Voice over IP (VoIP)**, **web conferencing**, and **video teleconferencing (VTC)**. These services are now standard in business and social communication platforms.

---

### 🧱 Legacy Systems: PSTN and PBX

#### Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
- Traditional telephone lines that deliver analog voice signals.
- Often referred to as **POTS** (Plain Old Telephone Service).
- Each line supports **one call at a time**, requiring separate lines for each user.

#### Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
- A digital trunking method that allows **multiple voice/data channels** over a single physical line.
- Used in early digital PBX systems to improve scalability.

---

### 🏢 Private Branch Exchange (PBX)

**PBX** = a private phone system inside an organization.

- Acts as a **local switchboard** for directing internal and external calls.
- Connects to the telecom carrier via a **digital trunk** (TDM).
- Supports features like:
  - Call transfer
  - Call waiting
  - Voicemail
  - Hold music

> 📌 **TDM PBX** = hardware system that supports multiple analog/digital lines.

### 📶 VoIP-Enabled PBX

TDM-based PBXs are now being replaced with **VoIP PBX** systems, which transmit calls over **IP networks** (LAN/internet).

#### 🧠 Key Capabilities:
- Supports internal and external voice/video traffic over Ethernet/IP.
- Routes calls between:
  - VoIP endpoints (phones, apps)
  - PSTN endpoints (with gateway)
- Can be **hardware** or **software**:
  - Software: 3CX, Asterisk (Linux-based)
  - Hardware: Cisco Unified Communications Manager

#### 🧰 Features:
- Call routing and voicemail
- Hold music
- Video conferencing
- Integration with mobile devices and softphones

---

### 🌐 Network Placement

- A VoIP PBX is placed at the **network edge**, protected by a **firewall**.
- Internal clients connect using **Ethernet**, **switching infrastructure**, and **IP addressing**.
- Uses the organization's **internet connection** to communicate with external VoIP providers.

### 🔁 Recap: Legacy vs. VoIP

| Feature              | Legacy PBX (TDM)       | VoIP PBX                 |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Medium               | Analog/Digital trunks   | IP over Ethernet         |
| Devices              | Desk phones             | VoIP phones, softphones  |
| Management           | Hardware-centric        | Software + cloud-based   |
| External Calls       | PSTN only               | PSTN + VoIP              |
| Location Flexibility | ❌ On-prem only         | ✅ Remote capable         |

### 🧠 Analogy

> **Old PBX systems** are like a physical switchboard at the office.  
> **VoIP PBX** is a digital switchboard that lives in your router, app, or cloud—routing calls over the same network you use for internet access.
