### ☎️ What Is a VoIP Phone?

A **VoIP phone** (or SIP endpoint) can be:
- A **software client** (on a computer or smartphone)
- A **hardware handset** connected to the IP network

VoIP phones use **SIP** for session control and **RTP** for media delivery.

### 🧱 VLAN Tagging for VoIP

VoIP phones often use **VLAN tagging** to separate **voice** traffic from **data** traffic.  
- Example: A VoIP handset has a **LAN port** and a **PC port**.
- Both devices (PC + phone) use the same Ethernet cable, but traffic is separated into:
  - 📢 Voice VLAN (SIP/RTP)
  - 🖥 Data VLAN (PC/web)

This keeps **latency-sensitive voice** traffic isolated from standard network congestion.

### 🔌 Power and Connectivity Options

| Type                    | Description                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **PoE (Power over Ethernet)** | Eliminates need for power adapters or batteries |
| **Wi-Fi Phones**            | Some handsets work over **802.11 networks** |

### 🔐 VoIP Security: SIPS and TLS

- **SIPS (Secure SIP)** uses:
  - 🔐 **Digital certificates** for authentication
  - 🔐 **TLS tunnel** to encrypt SIP signaling

- A secure **SIPS connection** can also generate a **master key** for encrypting RTP and control traffic.

> 🧠 Similar to HTTPS: authenticate → encrypt → communicate

### 🛠 VoIP Phone Installation Checklist

When deploying a new VoIP phone:
1. Connect to correct VLAN
2. Ensure PoE or power is functional
3. Register phone with SIP server
4. Run a **connectivity and echo test**:
   - Most providers offer a number that plays back your recorded message to verify **call quality**

### 🧠 Analogy

> A VoIP phone is like a smart walkie-talkie that runs over your office network, but knows which traffic to prioritize—and it gets its power through the same cable it talks through.
