## 🧠 Lesson 3.2.1 – Hubs

### 📌 Overview
- In early Ethernet networks, hubs were used to connect all end devices to a central point.
- Hubs are now obsolete but are still important for understanding basic Layer 1 behavior.
- Operate at the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** of the OSI model.
- Function as **multiport repeaters** – whatever comes in one port is sent out all others.

### 🔄 Traffic Behavior

- **Broadcasts** (MAC `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`) go to all devices.
- **Unicasts** also go to all ports – devices are expected to ignore packets not meant for them.
- Hubs do **not filter** or analyze traffic – they repeat **everything** to **everyone**.

> This makes hubs extremely "chatty" and creates **network congestion**.

---

### ⚠️ Security Concern: Promiscuous Mode

- Any device can be set to **promiscuous mode** to **capture all traffic**, even unicast.
- Because traffic is not isolated, attackers can **eavesdrop easily**.
- 🔓 **Major weakness** in hub-based networks – no confidentiality at Layer 1.

### 🧰 MDI vs. MDIX

- **MDI (Medium Dependent Interface)**: used by **end systems** (PCs, servers).
- **MDIX (MDI Crossover)**: used by **hubs** (and switches).
- Ensures:
  - Host **Tx (Transmit)** connects to Hub **Rx (Receive)**
  - Host **Rx** connects to Hub **Tx**

> This removes the need for crossover cables between host and hub.

---

### 🔧 Limitations of Hubs
- All ports share the **same collision domain**
- Only support **half-duplex** communication
- Use **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)
- Share total bandwidth (10 Mbps or 100 Mbps) across all devices
- No traffic isolation = poor performance & no security

---

### 🧠 Analogy
> A hub is like a megaphone in a crowded room — when one person speaks, **everyone hears it**, whether it’s meant for them or not.

### 🧪 Quick Facts
- 🧱 Layer: **1 (Physical)**
- 🔁 Traffic: **Rebroadcasts all**
- 🔒 Security: **None**
- 🧠 Intelligence: **Zero**
- 📉 Performance: **Low**
