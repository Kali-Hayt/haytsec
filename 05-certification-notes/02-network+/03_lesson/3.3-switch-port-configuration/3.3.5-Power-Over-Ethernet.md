## 3.3.5 ‚Äì Power Over Ethernet (PoE)

- **PoE** supplies electrical power from a switch port over regular Ethernet cabling.
- Powers devices like:
  - VoIP phones
  - IP cameras
  - Wireless access points (WAPs)
- More efficient than wall-plug adapters.
- Supports remote power management ‚Äî sleep states, power caps, etc.

### ‚ö° IEEE PoE Standards (now part of 802.3-2018)

- **802.3af** ‚Äì 15.4 W max (realistic usable ~13 W)
- **802.3at (PoE+)** ‚Äì 30 W supplied, ~25 W usable
- **802.3bt (PoE++)** ‚Äì 
  - Type 3: 60 W supplied, ~51 W usable  
  - Type 4: 90 W supplied, ~71 W usable

### üñß PoE Switch Behavior

- Called **PSE (Power Sourcing Equipment)** ‚Äî usually the switch.
- Cisco config example:
power inline auto max 15000
- Enables PoE on the port
- Caps output at 15,000 mW (15 W)

### üîç PoE Detection Phase

- When a device connects, the switch:
1. Detects if it's a **PoE-capable device**
2. If **not PoE**, no power is sent (no risk of damage)
3. If **PoE**, switch measures power needs and adjusts voltage safely
