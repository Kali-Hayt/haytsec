## 3.3.1 – Link Aggregation and NIC Teaming

- **Link aggregation** = combining 2 or more physical network links into one logical connection.
- Boosts speed and reliability.
- Example: 1 Gbps link + 1 Gbps link = 2 Gbps aggregated.

### 🔄 Where It’s Used
- Between two switches  
- Between a switch and a router  
- Between two routers

### 🧱 Alternate Names
- **NIC Teaming** (host side)  
- **Port Aggregation** (switch side)  
- Cisco calls it **EtherChannel**  
- Often called **“bonding”**

---

### 🛡️ Why It’s Useful
- **Redundancy**: One link fails → others keep things running  
- **Cost savings**: Multiple cheap ports can equal expensive single port (e.g., 4 x 1Gbps vs. 1 x 10Gbps)

> ⚠️ Full redundancy only exists if the reduced bandwidth still supports the workload.  
> If one link fails and remaining link isn’t enough → **not full redundancy**

---

### 📏 Standards + Protocols
- Uses **IEEE 802.3ad / 802.1ax**
- Interfaces are grouped into a **Link Aggregation Group (LAG)**
- Managed by **LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)**:
  - Detects config issues
  - Helps recover from physical link failure
