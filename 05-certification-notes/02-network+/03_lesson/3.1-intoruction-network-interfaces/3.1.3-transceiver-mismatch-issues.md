## ⚠️ 3.1.3 – Transceiver Mismatch Issues

### 🛠️ What is a Transceiver Mismatch?
A **transceiver mismatch** happens when the wrong type of transceiver, fiber cable, connector, or wavelength is used, leading to **signal loss, errors, or total failure**.

### 🧬 Key Compatibility Factors

- **Fiber Type**:
  - **Single-mode** uses **laser diodes**
  - **Multimode** uses **LEDs** or **VCSELs**
  - ⚠️ Don't mix these — they operate differently and at different ranges

- **Wavelength**:
  - Must match at both ends (e.g., 850 nm, 1300 nm, 1550 nm)
  - Mismatched wavelengths = **no data flow**

- **Connector Type**:
  - LC, SC, MPO, etc. must match both ends and transceivers

- **Ethernet Standard & Bit Rate**:
  - E.g., 1 GbE, 10 GbE, 40 GbE — transceivers must match link requirements

### 📡 Fiber Deployment Modes

- **Duplex**:  
  - Uses **2 strands** (Tx & Rx)
  - Most common setup

- **Parallel**:  
  - Uses **multiple strands** (8 or 20)
  - Higher bandwidth; used in data centers

- **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)**:  
  - Uses **wavelengths** to send multiple signals on one or two strands
  - Requires precision wavelength matching

---

### 🔁 BiDi (Bidirectional) Caution
- **BiDi** uses **one fiber strand** for both Tx and Rx using **different wavelengths**
- Must pair transceivers so Tx of one matches Rx of the other
