## üß™ Lab: Connect a Media Converter (3.1.9)

### üß≠ Scenario
You're a network technician. The company is switching to a new ISP.  
The new ISP runs **fiber to the basement networking closet**, but the **NSA device only supports copper Ethernet** ‚Äî not fiber.

To bridge the gap, you'll use a **media converter** with an **SFP port** that accepts a fiber transceiver and converts the signal to copper (RJ45).

### üß± Setup Constraints

- **Fiber patch panel**:
  - Port 23 = Tx (transmit)
  - Port 24 = Rx (receive)

- **Color-coded fiber connectors**:
  - **Connector A** (white/red) = Tx
  - **Connector B** (black) = Rx

- **Media converter**:
  - SFP module is already installed (fiber side)
  - Has RJ45 Ethernet port (copper side)

### üõ†Ô∏è Task Steps

1. **Place the media converter** on the rack shelf (bottom area).
2. **Disconnect the Ethernet cable** from the wall and plug it into the **RJ45 port on the media converter**.
3. **Select proper fiber optic cable** (multimode LC or SC, depending on patch panel).
4. **Connect fiber**:
   - Tx (connector A) ‚Üí Port 24 (Rx) on patch panel
   - Rx (connector B) ‚Üí Port 23 (Tx) on patch panel
5. **Connect power**:
   - Plug media converter into UPS (via adapter on shelf).
6. **Test connectivity**:
   - Use a PC on Floor 1 to verify internet access via the new ISP.

### üí° Key Takeaways

- Media converters bridge **different physical layer types** (fiber ‚Üî copper).
- Fiber connections must always be **Tx ‚Üî Rx** (crossover).
- Pay attention to **connector types** (SC, LC) and **cable type** (MMF/SMF).
- Media converters often use **SFP modules**, making them flexible and hot-swappable.

### ‚úÖ Real-World Use

| Use Case | Why Media Converter? |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Legacy devices with RJ45 only | Extend via fiber without replacing endpoints |
| Fiber backbone to copper LAN | Connect without upgrading switches |
| Temporary link testing or remote ISP drops | Fast deploy without full switch upgrade |
