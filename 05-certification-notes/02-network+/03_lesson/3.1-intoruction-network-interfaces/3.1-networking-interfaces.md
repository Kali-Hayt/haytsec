## 🧠 Network+ Lesson 3.1 – Network Interfaces

### ✅ Exam Objectives Covered
- **1.5**: Compare and contrast transmission media and transceivers.  
- **5.2**: Given a scenario, troubleshoot common cabling and physical interface issues.

---

### 📘 Lesson Overview
As a network technician, you'll work heavily with:
- **Installing, configuring, and troubleshooting** Ethernet interfaces and transceivers.
- A **network interface** is how a node connects to media and exchanges data with other hosts.
- This includes both:
  - The **physical connection** (cables, NICs)
  - The **logical protocol** (Ethernet framing, addressing)

Understanding how these components work is **critical** for selecting the right hardware and configuring it properly.

### 🔍 Study Questions
Use these to test yourself or build flashcards:

- What is the **function of a transceiver**?
- At which **OSI layers** do transceivers and network interfaces operate?
- What is **Ethernet framing**, and how are interfaces **uniquely addressed**?
- What is the **purpose of the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**?
- What does the MAC address `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` indicate?
- What are common **symptoms of transceiver issues**?

### 📌 Tip for HTB / Real-World
Interfaces and MACs show up **everywhere** — Wireshark, `ifconfig`, `ip a`, Nmap scans. Knowing how they're structured (and when they break) helps **spot spoofing, misconfigs, and pivot paths.**
