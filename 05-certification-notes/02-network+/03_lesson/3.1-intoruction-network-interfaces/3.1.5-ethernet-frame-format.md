## 🧱 3.1.5 – Ethernet Frame Format

### ✅ What is an Ethernet Frame?
An **Ethernet frame** is a **Layer 2 (Data Link)** protocol data unit (PDU). It wraps payloads from higher layers (IP, TCP, etc.) in a structure that can be transmitted over the physical network.

### 🧬 Ethernet Frame Structure

> 💡 The transceiver handles Layer 1 (Physical), but **Ethernet interfaces** also handle **Layer 2**: addressing + framing.

---

### 🔹 Preamble & Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)
- **Preamble**: 7 bytes (alternating 1s and 0s) used for **clock sync**
- **SFD**: 1 byte (two consecutive 1s) to mark start of frame
- Not technically part of the Ethernet frame

---

### 🔸 EtherType
- 2 bytes
- Identifies **what Layer 3 protocol** is inside the payload
  - `0x0800` = IPv4
  - `0x86DD` = IPv6

---

### 🛠️ Error Checking: CRC / FCS
- **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)** aka **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**: 4 bytes
- Receiver recalculates the CRC and compares it
- No retransmit if it fails — that’s handled by upper-layer protocols like TCP

---

### 📘 Key Facts to Memorize
- Ethernet = Layer 2
- Encapsulates IP, ARP, IPv6, etc.
- Helps detect errors but **not fix them**
- Wireshark displays frames in this structure — **learn to recognize CRC failures, EtherTypes, and preamble gaps**

---

### 🧪 HTB/Real-World Use
- Frame analysis is core to:
  - **Packet captures** (PCAP)
  - **Recon** (what protocols are running)
  - **Traffic manipulation** (mitmproxy, ettercap, etc.)
- Example: Analyzing ARP spoofing or identifying malformed packets
