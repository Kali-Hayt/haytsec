## 3.4.1 – Hardware Failure Issues

When troubleshooting, always rule out physical (Layer 1) and Data Link layer (Layer 2) problems **before** jumping into higher-layer issues.

## ⚡ Power Issues

- Networks require **stable power** to operate correctly.
- **Power anomalies** like surges, spikes, or brief outages can:
  - Damage hardware
  - Cause reboots, lockups, or full outages
- Enterprises use **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** to:
  - Keep critical devices (switches, routers, servers) alive during short power loss
  - Allow graceful shutdown or generator failover
- Most power problems may require escalation to **facilities or power providers**.

## 🛠️ Hardware Component Failure

- If power is good, check for:
  - 🧩 Bad NICs (network adapters)
  - 🔌 Faulty switches, routers, modems
  - 🧵 Damaged cabling

### 🎯 Steps to check:
- Verify drivers are working (use Device Manager on Windows)
- Check LEDs on network appliances (indicates link/activity)
- Ensure cards/modules are seated correctly
- Watch for **overheating**:
  - Make sure airflow is good
  - Clean dust, avoid direct sunlight

## 🧱 Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

- Most wired devices connect through a **switch**
- Analyze the **topology**:
  - Who’s affected?
  - Where is the problem device in the network?
- Helps narrow down whether the issue is a **switch**, **bridge**, or **cabling**

---

## 🔁 Final Step – Restart Device

- Once narrowed down to a device:
  - Try a reboot
  - Resets often resolve **transient (temporary) errors**

## 🔍 Key Tip

> Always rule out basic hardware and cabling before diving into fancy configs or software diagnosis.
