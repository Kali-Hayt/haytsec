# QUESTION 1  
What does a higher margin value indicate when measuring insertion loss?

❌ The cable is heavier than standard cables.  
❌ The cable is closer to not meeting acceptable link standards.  
❌ The cable exceeds the maximum allowed insertion loss.  
✅ The cable is further from reaching the maximum allowed insertion loss.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Heavier cable* is irrelevant to insertion loss margin. That’s physical, not electrical.
- ❌ A *higher* margin means you're safer — not closer to the limit. That would be a **lower** margin.
- ❌ If the cable *exceeded* the allowed loss, you'd fail the test — margin wouldn’t be high.

🧱 *Margin* in insertion loss is the "buffer" between actual loss and the max allowed. Higher = better.

# QUESTION 2  
When troubleshooting requires a change to the system or the network environment, what is MOST likely to be recommended as a course of action?

✅ Following a change management plan  
❌ Only making changes outside of business hours without notification  
❌ Making all changes at once to save time  
❌ Ignoring the standard procedures and making the change immediately  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Making changes outside business hours *without notification* breaks process and increases risk.
- ❌ Making *all changes at once* can snowball issues and complicate rollback.
- ❌ Ignoring procedures is a recipe for disaster. No audit trail, no rollback plan, and total chaos.

🧱 Change management = discipline + documentation + rollback + communication = professional ops.

# QUESTION 3  
Which vendor is known for dominating the Ethernet switch market, particularly with its Catalyst and Nexus platforms?

✅ Cisco  
❌ D-Link  
❌ HP Enterprise  
❌ NETGEAR  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ D-Link is focused more on consumer and small-business networking, not enterprise switching.
- ❌ HP Enterprise has a presence but doesn’t rival Cisco’s scale or market dominance.
- ❌ NETGEAR is mostly consumer-grade and small office, not large-scale enterprise switches.

🧱 Cisco’s Catalyst = access switching; Nexus = data center core. Together, they rule the enterprise switch world.

# QUESTION 4  
What does a +3 dB change in value represent?

✅ Doubling of the signal strength  
❌ No change in signal strength  
❌ A tenfold increase in signal strength  
❌ Halving of the signal strength  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ No change = 0 dB, not +3 dB.
- ❌ +10 dB (not +3 dB) = tenfold (10x) power increase.
- ❌ Halving = –3 dB, the opposite direction from +3 dB.

🧱 dB math rule of thumb:  
- +3 dB ≈ 2× power  
- –3 dB ≈ ½ power  
- +10 dB = 10× power  
- –10 dB = 1/10 power

# QUESTION 5  
Which of the following BEST describes a logical topology where all nodes can send traffic to one another using hardware addresses within the same segment?

✅ Logical segment topology  
❌ Ring topology  
❌ Star topology  
❌ Mesh topology  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Ring topology* describes a **physical** topology where data circulates in a loop—this doesn’t describe same-segment, hardware-based communication.
- ❌ *Star topology* refers to **physical layout**, typically with a central hub or switch—not a broadcast domain concept.
- ❌ *Mesh topology* describes **multiple redundant paths**—good for fault tolerance, but unrelated to logical segmentation or address-based communication.

🧱 In networking, a **logical segment** (aka broadcast domain) is where devices communicate directly using MAC addresses, without routing.

# QUESTION 6  
During a network audit, you discover that a switch port configured to connect to a server is set to autonegotiate speed and duplex settings. The server supports 1 Gbps full-duplex, but you notice performance issues.  
To optimize performance, you decide to manually configure the switch port speed and duplex settings.

Which set of commands should you use for port GigabitEthernet 0/2?

✅ interface GigabitEthernet 0/2; speed 1000; duplex full  
❌ speed auto; duplex auto  
❌ speed 1000; duplex full  
❌ switchport speed 1000; switchport duplex full  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *speed auto; duplex auto* leaves the port in the same problematic autonegotiation state—won’t resolve the mismatch or instability.
- ❌ *speed 1000; duplex full* is correct syntax **within interface configuration**, but **missing** the `interface` command to define the context—this isn’t valid at global config level.
- ❌ *switchport speed 1000; switchport duplex full* is invalid—`switchport` commands are for Layer 2 features (like VLANs), not speed/duplex control. These aren’t recognized IOS commands for setting speed/duplex.

🧱 The correct format involves:
interface GigabitEthernet 0/2  
speed 1000  
duplex full
This directly sets the port speed and duplex mode, eliminating autonegotiation problems—classic fix for switch-to-server issues.

# QUESTION 7  
A growing company has recently moved into a new office space. The company has 50 employees, each with their own workstation. The office also has multiple printers, a centralized server, and requires structured cabling for connectivity.  

Which type of network would be MOST effective for this setup?

✅ Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) network  
❌ Wide Area Network (WAN)  
❌ Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network  
❌ Data Center  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *WAN* refers to geographically dispersed networks (e.g., connecting offices across cities or countries)—not a fit for a single building of 50 users.
- ❌ *SOHO* networks are designed for fewer users (usually under 10), minimal infrastructure, and often rely on consumer-grade equipment—not scalable for 50 employees.
- ❌ *Data Center* describes a facility for hosting critical infrastructure or cloud services—not an internal office LAN.

🧱 An SME network is purpose-built for this scale: dozens of users, shared resources, servers, and reliable structured cabling. It's the sweet spot between small and large enterprise deployments.

# QUESTION 8  
What is insertion loss in the context of fiber optic cables?

❌ The increase in signal strength when a connector is installed on the end of a fiber optic cable  
❌ The enhancement of data security when a new connector is added to a fiber optic cable  
✅ The decrease in signal strength that occurs when a connector is installed on the end of a fiber optic cable  
❌ The process of inserting a new fiber optic cable into an existing network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Increase in signal strength* — Nope. Signal strength only *decreases* when connectors are introduced due to physical imperfections and reflections.
- ❌ *Data security enhancement* — This has absolutely nothing to do with signal loss. It’s not a security concept.
- ❌ *Inserting a cable into a network* — That’s more like physical installation or splicing. Insertion loss refers to signal degradation.

🧱 Insertion loss = the drop in optical power from one end of the cable to the other, especially when connectors or splices are involved. Always measured in dB, and always a *negative impact* on signal quality.

# QUESTION 9  
What happens when an Ethernet bridge receives a frame with a MAC address that is not in its forwarding database?

✅ The frame is flooded to all segments except for the source segment.  
❌ The frame is forwarded to the specific port associated with the MAC address.  
❌ The bridge sends a request to all ports to identify the destination MAC address.  
❌ The frame is dropped.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Forwarded to a specific port* — That’s only possible if the bridge already knows where the MAC lives. This question says it *does not*.
- ❌ *Sends a request to all ports* — Bridges don’t ask or query. They flood unknown unicast frames to all ports *except the one it came from*.
- ❌ *Dropped* — Nope. Not unless the frame is invalid. Unknown destinations are flooded, not discarded.

🧱 This is how Ethernet bridges “learn”: if the destination MAC isn't in the MAC table, they **flood** the frame. Once a reply comes back, they **learn** which port the MAC lives on.

---
# QUESTION 10  
Which process is utilized by the contention-based MAC system that Ethernet employs to manage data transmission?

✅ Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)  
❌ Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)  
❌ Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)  
❌ Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *CDMA* — This is used in mobile phone networks (like 3G). Not Ethernet.
- ❌ *TDMA* — Time slots are used in some WAN and wireless protocols, not Ethernet.
- ❌ *FDMA* — This splits the channel into frequencies. Think analog systems or some cellular systems.

🧱 Ethernet’s CSMA/CD: devices listen before sending, detect collisions during transmission, then back off randomly. It’s the old-school LAN bouncer — no scheduled turns, just watch and jump in if it’s clear.

# QUESTION 11  
What type of UTP cable should the IT manager use for the temporary network setup to accommodate frequent reconfigurations?

✅ Stranded conductor  
❌ Either solid or stranded, as both are equally flexible  
❌ Neither, as UTP cables are not designed for temporary setups  
❌ Solid conductor

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Either solid or stranded* — Not true. Solid is stiff and prone to break when bent repeatedly.
- ❌ *Neither...* — UTP is totally fine for temporary use; it’s used everywhere.
- ❌ *Solid conductor* — Solid wire is better for permanent, in-wall installations. It's less flexible and breaks under repeated movement. 

🧠 Stranded = flexible = better for patch cables and movable setups.
Solid = rigid = better for fixed runs and structured cabling in walls.

---
# QUESTION 12  
How can transitory errors in network devices often be resolved?

✅ By restarting the network device  
❌ By updating the user access policies  
❌ By changing the network topology  
❌ By increasing the network bandwidth

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *User access policies* — These control permissions, not device behavior or glitches.
- ❌ *Changing topology* — Overkill. Not relevant for temporary or intermittent faults.
- ❌ *Increasing bandwidth* — Transitory errors aren’t usually tied to bandwidth issues.

🛠️ A reboot clears temporary memory faults, resets processes, and often kicks things back into shape — the good ol' "turn it off and on again" fix.

# QUESTION 13  
Why are permanent cables run through conduit in a fiber optic cabling installation?

✅ To protect the cables from physical damage and environmental factors  
❌ To increase the data transmission speed of the fiber optic cables  
❌ To allow for easy color-coding and identification of cables  
❌ To facilitate the conversion of optical signals to electrical signals

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Increasing data speed* — Conduit has zero effect on signal speed. That's governed by the cable's specs, not what surrounds it.
- ❌ *Color-coding/ID* — That's done with cable jackets or tags, not conduit.
- ❌ *Signal conversion* — That happens in transceivers, not conduit.

🧱 Conduit = physical armor. It's like putting fiber in a protective pipe to shield it from moisture, rodents, bending stress, and construction hazards.

---
# QUESTION 14  
What does the **show config** command display on a switch?

✅ The switch's current configuration  
❌ The switch's IP address  
❌ The switch's version information  
❌ The list of connected devices  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *IP address* — Use `show ip interface` or `show running-config` to find it, but it's not the sole purpose of `show config`.
- ❌ *Version info* — That’s `show version`, not `show config`.
- ❌ *Connected devices* — That’s `show mac address-table` or `show cdp neighbors`.

🧱 `show config` = blueprint of how the switch is set up. Think VLANs, port settings, routing protocols—basically everything living in the startup or running config.

---
# QUESTION 15  
What mechanism is primarily used to protect wireless hosts connecting to a SOHO network through a SOHO router?

❌ MAC address filtering  
❌ Port forwarding  
✅ Encryption  
❌ Quality of Service (QoS) settings  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *MAC address filtering* — Weak and easy to spoof. Not reliable as a primary security mechanism.
- ❌ *Port forwarding* — Used to allow external access *into* the network (e.g., hosting servers), not for protecting wireless clients.
- ❌ *QoS settings* — Prioritizes traffic (e.g., VoIP over Netflix), but doesn't offer security.

🧱 Encryption (WPA2 or WPA3) protects wireless data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized access. It's the gold standard in SOHO Wi-Fi security.

---
# QUESTION 16  
What can cable testers report on?

❌ The maximum data transfer speed achievable by the network  
❌ The color of the cables  
❌ The Wi-Fi signal strength  
✅ Cable conditions, crosstalk, attenuation, noise, resistance, and other characteristics  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Maximum data transfer speed* — That’s a **function of the network equipment** and protocol, not something cable testers measure directly.
- ❌ *Color of the cables* — Purely cosmetic and irrelevant to testers. Color codes are for human organization, not electrical properties.
- ❌ *Wi-Fi signal strength* — Cable testers have nothing to do with wireless signals. They test **physical wired media**.

🧱 Cable testers are diagnostic tools for copper or fiber cables. They reveal signal degradation issues: e.g., too much **crosstalk**, **resistance**, or **attenuation** (signal weakening over distance).

# QUESTION 17  
You are an IT technician troubleshooting a reported issue where several users are experiencing intermittent network connectivity problems. To identify the precise nature of the problem, you decide to consult indirect sources of information.  
Which of the following sources would be MOST helpful in your investigation? (Select two.)

✅ Consulting recent job logs or speaking with other technicians who might have relevant information  
✅ Checking the system documentation, such as installation or maintenance logs  
❌ Reviewing the latest financial reports for budget cuts in the IT department  
❌ Sending a company-wide email asking if anyone else is experiencing similar issues  
❌ Reviewing the company's social media feed for any related complaints  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Financial reports* — Budget insight doesn’t help pinpoint a technical issue.
- ❌ *Company-wide email* — Too disruptive and unprofessional. Not a targeted approach.
- ❌ *Social media* — External and unreliable source. Rarely accurate for internal diagnostics.

🧱 **Job logs and maintenance records** help correlate symptoms with changes.  
🔍 **Talking to techs** gives real-time insight into known quirks or recent tweaks.

# QUESTION 19  
Which Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layer is responsible for the transmission of bits of data?

❌ Transport  
✅ Physical  
❌ Network  
❌ Datalink  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Transport** — Handles reliable delivery, error correction, and flow control. Think TCP/UDP, not bits on wire.
- ❌ **Network** — Responsible for routing and IP addressing. It decides *where* the data goes, not how the bits move.
- ❌ **Datalink** — Packages bits into frames and handles MAC addressing, but relies on Physical layer to actually send the raw bits.

✅ **Physical Layer** — The bottom of the OSI stack. It's responsible for raw bit transmission over physical media: cables, radio waves, electrical pulses. It defines things like:
  - Voltage levels  
  - Cable types  
  - Pin layouts  
  - Light pulses in fiber

🧱 Physical = bits on the wire  
📦 Datalink = frames  
📍 Network = packets  
🚛 Transport = delivery service (reliable/unreliable)

So when you think **bit transmission**, you're thinking **wires, fiber, radio = Physical**.

# QUESTION 20  
What does the first half of a MAC address represent?

✅ The manufacturer's unique identifier  
❌ The network segment identifier  
❌ The serial number of the device  
❌ The IP address of the device  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Network segment identifier** — That's an IP address’s job, not MAC. MAC addresses don't care about segments.
- ❌ **Serial number of the device** — MACs don’t store serials. The second half is a unique device ID, but it’s not the serial number.
- ❌ **IP address of the device** — MAC and IP are separate layers. MAC = Layer 2 (hardware), IP = Layer 3 (logical).

🧱 Structure of a MAC address (48 bits):
- **First 24 bits (OUI)** = **Organizationally Unique Identifier** assigned to the manufacturer (like Apple, Cisco, Intel)
- **Last 24 bits** = Unique per device (assigned by manufacturer)

Think of the MAC like this:  
**[Manufacturer ID][Device ID]**  
Like a car's VIN — first half tells you who built it, second half tells you which one it is.
