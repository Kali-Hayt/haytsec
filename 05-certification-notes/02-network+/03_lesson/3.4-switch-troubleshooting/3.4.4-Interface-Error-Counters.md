## 3.4.4 – Interface Error Counters

When you use `show interface` commands, you can detect problems like collisions or link instability. These errors help pinpoint **Layer 1 (physical)** or **Layer 2 (data link)** issues.

### 🔍 Causes of Interface Errors
- **Duplex mismatch** – Switch port and host have mismatched settings (e.g., full vs half duplex).
- **Legacy hub** – Older hubs can cause collisions.
- **Bad cabling or transceiver** – Leads to interference or transmission issues.
- **VLAN/ACL misconfig** – Frames may be discarded if they're not allowed on the network.

## Increasing Interface Counters

🧱 **Counters help diagnose flaky interfaces** – even when the link stays "up."

### Key Counter Types:

- **🔌 Link state**
  - Shows if interface is up/down.
  - Use to track reliability over time.

- **🔁 Resets**
  - Counts how often an interface resets.
  - Too many = serious performance problem.
  - Might reset due to high traffic, errors, or auto-recovery.

- **❌ Discards/Drops**
  - Frame discarded before it was sent/received.
  - Causes:
    - Checksum error
    - Jumbo frames without jumbo config
    - ACLs blocking traffic
    - Interface overloaded
    - Mismatched MTU

## Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Errors

🧪 CRC = math hash to verify data integrity.
- Sender calculates a 32-bit CRC on the frame.
- Receiver checks it — if it doesn’t match: **frame rejected**.

🔍 **Causes of CRC errors**:
- Electrical interference
- Damaged cables
- Optical mismatch (fiber modules)
- Bad terminations

---

## Runt Frame Errors

🧱 Runt = frame smaller than **64 bytes**
- Usually caused by **collisions** in half-duplex setups
- Can also mean:
  - Duplex mismatch
  - Legacy hub problems
  - Misconfigured VM or network card

---

## Giant Frame Errors

🧱 Giant = frame bigger than **1518 bytes**
- Can also be called a **"baby giant"** if it's between 1518 and 1600 bytes.

### Two main causes:

- **Jumbo Frames**
  - Sent by hosts configured to use large frames.
  - If switch isn’t configured to accept them → frames dropped.

- **802.1Q Ethernet Trunks**
  - VLAN trunking adds 4-byte headers.
  - If one side uses trunking and the other doesn't → size mismatch causes drops.

## Summary

| Error Type         | Likely Cause                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| CRC Errors         | Cable/interference/mismatch          |
| Runt Frames        | Collisions, bad duplex config        |
| Giant Frames       | Jumbo frames or VLAN trunk mismatch  |
| Interface Resets   | Flapping, overload, errors           |
| Discards/Drops     | ACLs, load, VLAN config              |
