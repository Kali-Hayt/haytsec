## 3.4.1 â€“ Hardware Failure Issues

### ðŸ§± Troubleshooting Principle
- Always rule out **hardware failure** and **Data Link layer** issues before escalating to Network or Application layer problems.

---

### ðŸ”Œ Power Issues
- Networks need **stable power**.
- Power problems = spikes, surges, under-voltage â†’ can **crash, reboot, or damage** systems.
- Use **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** to:
  - Keep switches/routers up briefly
  - Allow safe shutdowns
  - Prevent data loss
- Escalate to **electrician or utility** if outside IT scope.

---

### ðŸ’¥ Hardware Component Failures
- If power's fine, check:
  - Network adapters (NICs)
  - Switch/router/modem appliances
  - Cables between devices

- Check **drivers** (esp. in Windows via Device Manager).
- Look for **LED indicators** on devices.
- Watch out for:
  - Unseated cards/modules
  - **Overheating** â€“ bad airflow, dust buildup, sun exposure

---

### ðŸ§± Data Link Layer Focus
- Wired devices talk through **switches**.
- If devices arenâ€™t working:
  - Analyze the network **topology**
  - See who is affected
  - Trace the failing **bridge or switching point**

---

### ðŸ§° Final Step
- Narrowed it down?
  - Try **rebooting the switch**.
  - Often fixes transitory (temporary) errors.

## 3.4.2 â€“ Port Status Indicators

### ðŸ§± LED Indicators for Troubleshooting (Layer 1 & 2)
- Found on **NICs and switch/router ports**
- Vendors might use:
  - 2 LEDs (status + activity)
  - Mode buttons to toggle meaning

---

### ðŸ’¡ Common LED States

- **Solid green** â€“ Link is up, but no traffic
- **Flickering green** â€“ Link is working **with traffic**
  - Blink rate = link speed
- **No light** â€“ Link down / port shut
- **Blinking amber** â€“ Fault!
  - Examples: **duplex mismatch**, **collisions**, **redundancy errors**
- **Solid amber** â€“ Port blocked by **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** to prevent loops
