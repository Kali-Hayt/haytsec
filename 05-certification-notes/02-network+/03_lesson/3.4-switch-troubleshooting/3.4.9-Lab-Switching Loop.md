## 3.4.9 – Lab: Switching Loop

### 🧪 Lab Scenario

You’re managing several networking devices inside a wiring closet:

- 1 router (connected to the internet and 1 switch)
- 3 switches total
- Redundant uplinks between switches (potential for switching loops)

### 🎯 Objective

- ✅ **Enable** all necessary ports on each switch so that:
  - Computers can communicate with each other
  - Internet access is functional via the router
- ❌ **Avoid** creating a **switching loop**:
  - Disable redundant uplink ports if they aren’t part of a spanning tree solution
  - Use caution with enabling connections between switches

### ⚠️ Tips

- A **switching loop** happens when there are multiple active paths between switches—causing broadcast storms and MAC table instability.
- Only **one uplink** path should be active between switches unless **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)** is in place (not mentioned here, so assume it’s manual).
- An enabled port = **activity light is ON**

### 📌 Instructions

1. Select each port.
2. Enable the ports that:
   - Connect end-user devices (PCs)
   - Connect to the router
3. Disable extra uplinks between switches that create loops.

🛠️ Use the **Exhibits** tab in the lab for visualizing connections and determining port roles.
