## 3.4.3 – Switch Show Commands

When troubleshooting network issues, it's important to isolate the problem. If a host has trouble connecting, and you’ve ruled out Layer 1 (physical) issues, you might be dealing with a Layer 2 (Data Link) configuration problem. Cisco switches offer powerful `show` commands for diagnosis.

---

### 🧱 Key Show Commands

- `show config`
  - Displays the switch’s configuration.
  - Compares **startup-config** (what loads on boot) vs **running-config** (what's currently active).
  - Useful for detecting undocumented changes.

- `show interface [interface-id]`
  - Reports **physical and protocol status** of an interface (e.g., `GigabitEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up`).
  - Reveals traffic stats, duplex settings, errors, resets, collisions, etc.

### 🔍 Sample Interface Output Breakdown

```bash
Switch# show int g0/1
GigabitEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
  Hardware is Lance, address is 0001.6487.9619
  BW 1000000 Kbit, DLY 1000 usec
  reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255
  ...
  0 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun
  2357 packets output, 10 interface resets
```

- **BW / DLY**: Bandwidth and delay settings.
- **txload/rxload**: Interface utilization.
- **reliability**: Always out of 255 — full health is 255/255.
- **resets**: Frequent resets could indicate physical or config issues.

### ⚠️ Interface Status Conditions

| Status                    | Meaning |
|--------------------------|---------|
| `down/down`              | No link. Could be unplugged, speed mismatch, or bad NIC/cable. |
| `administratively down`  | Interface is **disabled** via `shutdown`. Use `no shutdown` to enable. |
| `down/error disabled`    | Port shutdown due to **STP**, **port security**, or another error. |
| `up/down (suspended)`    | **LACP** or EtherChannel misconfigured. One side may be passive or missing settings. Use `show etherchannel`. |

### ✅ Auto-negotiation Tips

- **Mismatch scenarios**:
  - Switch = auto, Host = fixed config → defaults to 10 Mbps/half-duplex. ❌
  - Both sides fixed but don’t match = link down. ❌
- Best practice: Set both ends to **auto** or **identical fixed values**.

### 🧠 Final Insight

> Always check port status and show commands *before* replacing hardware. Sometimes, a simple `no shutdown` or duplex fix saves you hours of chasing ghosts.
