## 3.4.6 ‚Äì Network Loop and Broadcast Storm Issues

- A **network loop** happens when flooded frames (like broadcasts) keep circulating endlessly between switches.
- Because switches flood unknown traffic out all ports, the frame goes from switch to switch, back and forth.
- This causes MAC address tables to become confused or cleared‚Äîleading to more traffic being flooded instead of unicast.
- The network becomes overwhelmed‚Äîthis is known as a **broadcast storm**.

### Symptoms of a Broadcast Storm:
- Switch CPU spikes (80%+)
- Bandwidth maxes out
- Network becomes sluggish or unusable
- Devices may crash due to resource exhaustion

### Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to the Rescue:
- STP detects loops and **blocks a port** to break the loop.
- STP isolates the issue to prevent full network meltdown.
- You should check:
  - Patch panels (sometimes mis-patched or looped to themselves)
  - Floor jacks or wall ports (accidental internal loops)
  - Switch logs for MAC address flapping or port status changes

### If STP is Already Enabled and Storm Still Happens:
- ‚úÖ Verify STP or RSTP is supported and running correctly on all switches.
- ‚úÖ Check old hardware like **Ethernet hubs** (no loop protection).
- ‚úÖ Look for **unmanaged switches**, **cheap desktop switches**, or **VoIP phones** acting as unintended bridges.

üß± **Key analogy**: A network loop is like yelling in a cave and hearing your voice echo louder and louder until the walls shake apart.

üîç **Tip**: MAC address flapping = MAC address bouncing between ports. It‚Äôs a red flag for a loop.
