## 3.4.5 – MAC Address Table 🧱

### 🧠 How MAC Learning Works
- A switch learns MAC addresses by reading the **source MAC** of incoming frames.
- These MAC-port mappings are stored in the **MAC address table** (also called the **CAM table**).
- Stored in **Content Addressable Memory (CAM)** for fast lookup.

### 🗂️ Table Behavior
- Entries remain in the table for a limited time unless refreshed.
- Helps avoid problems when devices (MACs) move or change.

### ❓ What if MAC isn't in the table?
- The switch **floods** the frame to all ports except the source.
- Acts like a hub temporarily until the MAC is learned.

### 🔍 Viewing the MAC Address Table

Use this command:
`plaintext
Switch# show mac address-table

### 📋 Sample Output

|VLAN|MAC Address|Type|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|0090.0cd5.1001|DYNAMIC|Fa0/24|
|10|0000.0c11.d48e|DYNAMIC|Fa0/3|
|10|0090.2105.8582|DYNAMIC|Fa0/2|
|10|00d0.d3db.9ca9|DYNAMIC|Fa0/1|
|20|0005.5e32.c45b|DYNAMIC|Fa0/2|
|20|000c.cf54.66d4|DYNAMIC|Fa0/1|
|20|0060.5c30.9777|DYNAMIC|Fa0/3|

### 🔁 Duplicate MACs?

- You might see the **same MAC on multiple VLANs** (like `0090.0cd5.1001`), which is expected for trunk or multi-VLAN environments.
