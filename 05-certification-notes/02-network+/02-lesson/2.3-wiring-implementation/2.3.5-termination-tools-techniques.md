# 2.3.5 — Termination Tools and Techniques

---

## Basic Termination Process

To terminate a cable:

- Untwist the ends of the wire pairs and arrange them to match T568A or T568B.
- Do **not** untwist more than **0.375 inches (1 cm)** — especially important for Cat 6.

- Used for terminating fixed cable into IDC blocks.
- Compatible with formats: `66`, `110`, `BIX`, `Krone`
- Uses **double-sided blades**:
  - One side pushes wire into terminal
  - The other side cuts excess wire
- Always face the **"cut"** side of the blade toward the excess

## Terminating Shielded / Screened Cable

- Requires **shielded IDC** or **metal modular plugs**.
- On IDCs: metal clip bonds exposed foil/braided shield to housing.
- On plugs: shield connects to a bonding strip inside the metal plug.
