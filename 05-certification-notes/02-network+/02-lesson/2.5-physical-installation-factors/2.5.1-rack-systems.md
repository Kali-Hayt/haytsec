## 2.5.1 Rack Systems

### Overview
Networking equipment should always be installed in secure areas. These areas may be called:
- Telecommunications closets
- Equipment rooms
- Server rooms
- Or an entire **datacenter**

These spaces must be:
- Dedicated to appliance/server installation only
- Physically secured (access control required)
- Not used for general storage

### What Is a Rack?
A **rack** is:
- A specially configured steel shelving system
- Designed for standard-size equipment
- More space-efficient than desks/shelves

Using racks improves:
- **Security**
- **Density** (more gear in less space)
- **Cable management**

---

### Rack Dimensions

- **Width:**  
  - Standard is **19 inches** (48.26 cm) EIA spec  
  - Devices are screwed directly into rack rails  
  - Non-standard hardware (e.g., towers/monitors) goes on **shelves**

- **Height:**  
  - Measured in **"U" units** = 1.75 inches (4.45 cm)  
  - Racks range from **8U to 48U**  
  - Equipment height is listed in U (ex: 2U switch, 4U server)

### Physical Layout & Cooling

#### ❄ Hot Aisle / Cold Aisle
- Racks should have **3 ft (1m) clearance** for service + airflow
- Multiple racks are placed **back-to-back**, not front-to-back
- Prevents hot exhaust from contaminating cold air intake

> *"A hot aisle/cold aisle layout ensures that hot air expelled from exhaust vents does not contaminate cool air drawn in through intake vents."*

#### 🔄 Port-Side Exhaust
Some devices support:
- **Port-side exhaust**: ports + exhaust fan on same side  
- **Port-side intake**: cool air drawn from port side

Useful for:
- Better airflow
- Cleaner cable management

### Security & Efficiency

- Use **blanking plates** to cover unused rack slots (improves airflow)
- Install **lockable front and rear doors** to:
  - Prevent unauthorized access
  - Physically secure equipment
