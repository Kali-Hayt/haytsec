## ðŸ§± Fiber Distribution Panels

In modern network infrastructure, copper wiring is often replaced by **fiber optic cabling** for improved performance. These installations follow structured cabling practices similar to copper, but require careful handling to prevent wear and tear.

- **Permanent fiber runs** are routed through **conduit** to:
  - **Wall ports** at the user end (client access).
  - **Fiber distribution panels** at the switch or network end.

The goal is to **avoid frequent reconnections** of fiber strands, which can damage the cables.

To complete the circuit:
- **Fiber patch cables** are used between:
  - Wall port â†” **Network Interface Card (NIC)**
  - Patch panel â†” **Switch port**

This modular approach ensures durability, ease of maintenance, and efficient signal routing in both enterprise and data center environments.
