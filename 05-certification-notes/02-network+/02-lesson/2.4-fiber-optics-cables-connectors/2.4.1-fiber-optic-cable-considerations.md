## ðŸ“š 2.4.1 â€” Fiber Optic Cable Considerations

Fiber optic cables offer major advantages over copper cables due to their signaling method and structure. While copper uses electrical signals (which are prone to interference and attenuation), fiber optics use **pulses of infrared light**, which are immune to electromagnetic interference, difficult to tap, and suffer less from signal loss. This allows fiber optic cables to support **higher bandwidth over much longer distances**, often stretching several kilometers.

### ðŸ”¬ Construction of a Fiber Optic Cable

A single optical fiber is made up of **three core elements**:

- **Core**: The central part that transmits the light signal. Acts as the waveguide.
- **Cladding**: A layer that surrounds the core and reflects light back inward using a slightly different refractive index, enabling **total internal reflection** to keep the light inside the core.
- **Buffer**: A plastic coating that protects the fiber. It may be **tight-buffered** or **loose-buffered** depending on design, with some versions including lubricants for flexibility.

### ðŸ”„ Direction and Multiplexing

- A **single fiber strand** transmits data in **one direction** only.
- To enable two-way communication or multiple applications, **multiple fiber strands are bundled** within a single cable.

### ðŸ§± Jacket and Reinforcement Options

Fiber optic cables are designed for different environments:
- **Indoor/plenum**, **outdoor**, **underground**, **undersea**, etc.
- Protective layers include **Kevlar (Aramid)** strands or **fiberglass rods** to guard against pulling damage.
- **Steel shielding (armor)** is used outdoors to protect against rodents or physical wear.

These physical construction choices ensure the fiber optic cable remains durable and performs reliably in varied and often harsh conditions.
