## 🚀 2.1.4 – 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet Standards

### ⚡ What Is 100BASE-TX?

- **Fast Ethernet** = Enhanced version of Ethernet using better encoding and signaling  
- Supports **100 Mbps** over **Cat5 (or better)** twisted pair cable  
- Max distance: **100 meters (328 feet)**  
- Uses same **CSMA/CD** protocol as 10BASE-T, but at higher speed

### 🔁 Hubs vs Switches 

- 100BASE-TX could be used with hubs, **but** it was designed during the rise of **switches**
- Hubs only operate at the **Physical layer** — they **repeat** signals blindly
- Switches use **Layer 2 logic** to inspect MAC addresses and create **temporary circuits** between two devices
- **Each switch port = separate collision domain**
- Switches support **full-duplex**, meaning:
  - Devices can send/receive simultaneously
  - Each can use the full **100 Mbps** link

### 🔌 Autonegotiation & Compatibility

- Fast Ethernet introduced **autonegotiation** for backward compatibility with 10 Mbps devices
- Allows negotiation of:
  - **Speed**: 10 or 100 Mbps
  - **Duplex mode**: half or full duplex
- 10BASE-T devices use **electrical pulses** when idle to maintain link status
- Fast Ethernet adds a **16-bit Fast Link Pulse** to advertise speed and duplex capabilities

---

### 🧾 Key Term: Fast Link Pulse (FLP)

- A special signal that advertises the device’s Ethernet capabilities
- Used to **detect and negotiate** supported speeds/duplex modes
- Devices that don’t support FLP still send **normal link pulses**, so FLP-compat
