## 📡 2.1.1 – Network Data Transmission

Network data transfer works by **modulating the properties of a transmission medium**—such as electric current, infrared light, or radio waves—to encode a signal.  
A common modulation method involves switching between **low and high voltage states** in an electrical circuit.  
These voltage pulses represent digital bits—**ones and zeros**.

Each media type supports a specific **range of frequencies**.  
Higher frequencies can transfer **more data per second**.  
This frequency range is known as the **media bandwidth**.

> ℹ️ **Note on Bandwidth:**  
> Technically, bandwidth is the range of frequencies (in Hertz) a medium can carry.  
> However, in networking, bandwidth often refers to **data throughput**—the number of bits per second (bps).  
> Encoding methods allow, for example, a 100 MHz signal to deliver **over 100 Mbps** of data transfer.

## 🧠 What “Media Bandwidth” Really Means in Networking

> ⚠️ In networking, “media” does **not** mean video or audio files.  
> It refers to the **physical transmission medium** like cables or wireless signals.

### 📡 What Is "Media" in This Context?
- 🧵 Twisted pair copper cable (Cat5e, Cat6, etc.)
- 💡 Fiber optic cable
- 📡 Radio waves (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.)

---

### 🎯 Why It Matters:
- **Media bandwidth** (measured in Hertz) = the **range of frequencies** a medium supports  
- Higher frequency range **can** carry more data → higher potential **throughput** in Mbps or Gbps
- You need to match the right media type to the **speed, distance, and use case**

---

### 📌 Key Takeaways:
- **"Media" ≠ videos, files, or content**  
  → It means the **physical pathway** for network signals  
- **Media bandwidth** (Hz) + **encoding method** = how much **data per second** (Mbps/Gbps)
- Choosing the wrong cable or medium will **bottleneck your speed**, even if your devices support higher throughput

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Relevance:
- Troubleshooting slow speeds? Media bandwidth might be the bottleneck.
- Choosing between Cat5e, Cat6, or fiber? You’re really choosing **media bandwidth capacity**.
