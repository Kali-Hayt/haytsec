## ‚ö° 2.1.5 ‚Äì Gigabit Ethernet Standards

### üöÄ What Is Gigabit Ethernet?

- Builds on Ethernet and Fast Ethernet standards
- Supports **1,000 Mbps (1 Gbps)** data rate
- Common implementation: **1000BASE-T**
  - Uses **Cat5e or better** twisted pair cable
  - Max distance: **100 meters (328 feet)**
- Does **not support hubs** ‚Äî only implemented with **switches**

---

### üß∞ Gigabit in Modern Networks

- **Default choice** for most new wired access networks
- Used to connect client devices (PCs, printers) to LANs
- Supports both **copper** and **fiber optic** cabling
  - **Copper** = cheaper, easier to install, more widely supported
  - **Fiber** = better long-term upgrade potential

---

### üí• 10/40 Gigabit Ethernet (10/40 GbE)

- **10 GbE** = 10x faster than standard Gigabit
  - Requires **higher frequency** = shorter max cable distance
  - Needs **higher category** shielded cables (Cat6A, Cat7, Cat8) or **fiber**
- **40 GbE** = Used mostly for **data center backbones** or high-performance environments
  - Expensive hardware ‚Äî not common in regular office networks

### üìä Cable Specs

| Specification | Cable Type         | Max Distance     |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 10GBASE-T     | UTP (Cat 6)        | 55 m (180 feet)  |
|               | F/UTP (Cat 6A)     | 100 m (328 feet) |
|               | S/FTP (Cat 7)      | 100 m (328 feet) |
| 40GBASE-T     | S/FTP (Cat 8)      | 30 m (100 feet)  |

---

### üßæ Deployment Notes

- **10/40 GbE** is expensive and uncommon in end-user networks
- Often used for:
  - **TV/film production**
  - **Data center backbones**
  - **Switch-to-switch or switch-to-router** links

## üßµ UTP vs FTP vs STP ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Difference?

| Abbreviation | Name                       | Shielding Details                                     | Use Case                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **UTP**      | Unshielded Twisted Pair    | ‚ùå No shielding at all                                 | Cheap, common in home/office networks         |
| **FTP**      | Foiled Twisted Pair        | ‚úÖ Foil shield wraps all pairs (one big foil wrap)     | Medium noise protection, used in Cat6A        |
| **STP**      | Shielded Twisted Pair      | ‚úÖ Individual shielding for **each pair**               | High EMI environments, more expensive         |
| **S/FTP**    | Shielded + Foiled Twisted Pair | ‚úÖ Foil on each pair **and** braided overall shield | Maximum shielding, used in Cat7/Cat8          |
| **F/UTP**    | Foil over UTP              | ‚úÖ Foil shield around all unshielded pairs             | Mid-tier shielded cable, common in Cat6A      |

---

### üß† What It Means:

- **More shielding = more resistance to electromagnetic interference (EMI)**  
- More shielding also means:
  - Higher cost
  - Thicker cables
  - Harder to install (but more reliable in dirty environments)

---

### ‚ö° TL;DR

```
UTP = cheap and common
FTP = foil shield for light EMI protection
S/FTP = beast mode shielding for data centers
```

üìå Shielding helps when you're running cables:
- Near fluorescent lights
- Inside walls with electrical conduit
- Across industrial/factory floors
