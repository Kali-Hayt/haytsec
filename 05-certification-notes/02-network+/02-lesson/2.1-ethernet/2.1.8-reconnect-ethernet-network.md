### ✅ Lab 2.1.8 - Reconnect to an Ethernet Network

**Scenario:**
You’re working as a network technician. An employee reports they’ve lost connection to both the local network and the internet. You troubleshoot and determine their **built-in network card has failed**.

---

### 🧠 Your Task:
- Install a **new network card** that provides the **fastest Ethernet** connection from available inventory.
- Use the **existing cable** to connect back to the local network.
- Confirm that the workstation **successfully reconnects** to the local network and the internet.

---

### ✅ Best NIC Choice:

**Select:**  
`Network adapter, Ethernet 1000BaseTX, PCIe`  
- **Why?**  
  - 1000BaseTX = **1 Gbps** (fastest option available)  
  - **PCIe** = Faster interface than PCI  
  - Fully compatible with existing Cat5e/Cat6 cables  
  - Ideal for corporate local network speeds

---

### ❌ Avoid These:
- **56K / 33.6K Modems:** Dial-up, not Ethernet
- **100BaseTX:** Only 100 Mbps, slower than 1000BaseTX
- **10Base2/10BaseT:** Outdated and extremely slow

---

🛠️ **Final Steps:**
- Install the PCIe 1000BaseTX card into the workstation.
- Connect it to the wall jack or switch using the existing RJ45 Ethernet cable.
- Verify connectivity by pinging another machine or accessing the internet.

💡 *Done right, your user is back online — faster than before.*

## 🛠️ Lab 2.1.8 – Reconnect to an Ethernet Network (CAT6 → New NIC)

### 🧩 Issue:
Built-in network card on the workstation failed. Device could not connect to local network or internet.

### 🔎 Diagnosis:
- Onboard NIC was non-functional
- Swapped CAT6 to laptop confirmed the cable was fine
- No link lights on old NIC
- `169.254.x.x` address confirmed DHCP failure

### ✅ Solution Steps:

1. **Selected replacement NIC:**
   - Installed **Network adapter, Ethernet 1000BaseTX, PCIe** (1 Gbps)

2. **Installed card to PCIe slot** inside the workstation

3. **Moved CAT6 cable** from failed onboard NIC to **new PCIe card port**

4. **Verified status:**
   - Link lights active ✅  
   - Windows detected new adapter ✅  
   - IP assigned via DHCP: `192.168.0.x` ✅  
   - DNS servers correctly received ✅  
   - Internet access confirmed ✅

---

### 📘 Notes:
- CAT6 is fully compatible with Gigabit Ethernet (1000BaseTX)
- PCIe card provided faster & stable connection
- Issue was resolved with minimal downtime

---

### 🏁 Outcome:
✅ Workstation reconnected to local LAN and internet via newly installed NIC.
