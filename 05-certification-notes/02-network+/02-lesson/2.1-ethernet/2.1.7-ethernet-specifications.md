### 🧵 Cable Breakdown (Top to Bottom, Left to Right):

1. **Top-left:**
    - Standard **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)** copper  
    - Used in Ethernet up to 1 Gbps  
    - ❌ **Not optical**, **not 10GBASE-compliant**

2. **Top-right:**
    - **Shielded twisted pair (STP or FTP)**  
    - Used in **10GBASE-T** (copper-based)  
    - ❌ **Still copper**, not optical

3. **Bottom-left (orange, beige connectors):**
    - **Multimode fiber** with **SC connectors**  
    - ✅ Used for **10GBASE-SR**

4. **Bottom-right (yellow cable with blue and metal ends):**
    - **Single-mode fiber** with **LC and ST connectors**  
    - ✅ Used for **10GBASE-LR** and long-range fiber optics

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The **bottom two cables** are **optical fiber** and meet **10GBASE** standards.

### ❓ Question 3: LAN Port Identification

> **Q:** Identify the correct section of the image that corresponds to the LAN ports used to connect to local routers or computers over RJ45 patch cords.

---

### ✅ Correct Answer:  
**The RJ45 LAN ports on the Optical Modem (ONT)**

- These are the **gray rectangular ports** located on the **front right** side of the ONT.
- They are labeled for **network cable** connections.
- These ports use **RJ45 connectors** to connect to local devices like **routers, switches, or computers**.

---

### 🧠 Why This Is Correct:
- LAN ports = RJ45 = Ethernet over twisted pair  
- ONT = Optical Network Terminal = converts fiber to Ethernet  
- The **orange optical fiber** is **not LAN** — it's WAN (Wide Area Network).

**Q:** Which of the following is not an example of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standards?

- 🟦 Top-left (yellow fiber cables): ❌ *Incorrect (This is Ethernet fiber: 802.3z / 802.3ae)*
- 🟨 Top-right (2-pin telephone connectors): ✅ **Correct — NOT Ethernet (these are RJ11 used in telephony)**
- 🟧 Bottom-left (orange fiber cables): ✅ Ethernet (e.g., 1000BASE-SX)
- 🟦 Bottom-right (blue RJ45 cables): ✅ Ethernet (10/100/1000BASE-T)

**Explanation:**  
The **RJ11 connectors** (highlighted section) are **telephone connectors**, used in analog/digital voice lines — **not part of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet**, which uses **RJ45** or **fiber optics**.

**💡 Remember:**  
IEEE 802.3 = Ethernet  
RJ11 = Telephony  
RJ45 = Ethernet  
SC/LC/ST = Ethernet over fiber
