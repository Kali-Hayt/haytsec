### üß† Troubleshooting Strategy

1. **Step 1: Check from ITAdmin**
   - `ping 192.168.0.31` ‚Äî verify if Office2 is reachable
   - If it fails, try pinging other hosts (e.g. Office1, CorpServer) to isolate

2. **Step 2: Investigate Physical Connection**
   - Check Office2‚Äôs network port and Ethernet cable
   - Verify activity lights (blinking = connected)
   - If no link lights, swap with a known-good cable

3. **Step 3: Check IP Settings on Office2**
   - `ipconfig` ‚Äî look for:
     - Incorrect subnet
     - Missing or duplicate IP
     - APIPA (169.254.x.x) address = DHCP failure

4. **Step 4: Repair**
   - Manually set correct IP (192.168.0.31) if need
