## 5.6.4 Tagged and Untagged Ports

🧱 **Port Tagging Logic:**
- If a frame is addressed to a port **in the same VLAN on the same switch**, ✅ **no tag is added** to the frame.
- If the frame must cross a **trunk link**, ✅ the switch **adds a VLAN 802.1Q tag** before forwarding.

🧱 **Untagged Ports (Access Ports):**
- Only participate in **one VLAN**.
- Typically used to connect end-user devices (e.g., PCs, printers).
- The **frame is untagged** since it’s local to a VLAN.
- Ideal for ports that won't switch VLANs.

🧱 **Tagged Ports (Trunk Ports):**
- Carry traffic for **multiple VLANs**.
- Use **802.1Q tagging** to mark VLAN membership.
- Required when:
  - Connecting **switches** together.
  - Connecting a switch to a **router**.
  - Connecting to a **virtualized server** with guests in different VLANs.

🔍 **Use Case Example:**
- A virtualization host might need a **tagged trunk port** if VMs on the same host belong to different VLANs.

✅ Tagged = multiple VLANs (trunk).
✅ Untagged = one VLAN (access).
