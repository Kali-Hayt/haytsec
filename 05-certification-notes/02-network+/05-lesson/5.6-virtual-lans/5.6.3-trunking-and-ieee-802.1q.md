## 5.6.3 Trunking and IEEE 802.1Q

### üß± What is Trunking?
- Large networks often require multiple switches due to limited ports on a single switch.
- These switches are interconnected using **trunks**‚Äîspecial ports configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs.
- Trunks form the backbone of the Layer 2 fabric and allow VLAN traffic to traverse across switches.

### ‚úÖ IEEE 802.1Q Standard (VLAN Tagging)
- Trunk links use the **IEEE 802.1Q** protocol to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to.
- 802.1Q inserts a **VLAN tag** (4-byte header) into Ethernet frames:
  - Placed **between** Source MAC and EtherType.
  - Includes:
    - **VLAN ID (VID)**: Range 1‚Äì4094.
    - **Priority**: Used for Quality of Service (QoS).
  - EtherType field is updated to show the frame is 802.1Q-tagged.

### üì¶ VLAN Frame Structure (with 802.1Q Tag)
Destination MAC | Source MAC | 802.1Q Tag | EtherType | Payload | FCS
### üîç Notes
- Untagged traffic is associated with the switch‚Äôs **native VLAN**.
- All VLAN traffic crossing a trunk must be tagged except the native VLAN.
