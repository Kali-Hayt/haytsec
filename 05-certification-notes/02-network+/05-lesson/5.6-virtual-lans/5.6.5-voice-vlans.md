## 5.6.5 Voice VLANs

Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic requires higher priority due to strict latency and bandwidth needs. A dedicated VLAN (Voice VLAN) is typically used to isolate and prioritize voice traffic over standard data traffic.

### ðŸ§± Typical VoIP Setup:
- VoIP handsets often have **2 ports** (1 for PC uplink, 1 for wall jack).
- The handset **forwards PC traffic as untagged**, but **tags voice traffic** with 802.1Q.
- This allows both devices to share one cable, but use separate VLANs.

### âœ… Sample Voice VLAN Configuration:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0  
switchport mode access  
switchport access vlan 100     # for PC  
switchport voice vlan 101      # for VoIP  
```

### ðŸ“¡ Voice VLAN Behavior:
- Data: **Untagged**
- Voice: **Tagged with VLAN ID**
- Switch only accepts tagged frames matching the **voice VLAN ID**
ðŸ§  CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) can auto-configure VLAN ID on handsets, reducing manual setup.
