## 5.3.2 – Network Address Translation (NAT) Types

### 🧱 What is NAT?
- NAT = Network Address Translation.
- Used by edge routers to enable communication between **private** (internal) and **public** (Internet) networks.
- NAT allows internal devices to share a limited pool of public IPv4 addresses.
- 🧱 Not a security feature by itself—security is handled by ACLs (Access Control Lists).

---

### ✅ Why NAT Matters
- IPv4 address space is limited.
- NAT helps reduce the need for public IPs by translating internal private IPs to public ones.
- Essential for Internet communication from internal networks.

## NAT Types

### 🔁 Static NAT
- One-to-one mapping between **inside local** (private IP) and **inside global** (public IP).
- Example: Host behind a firewall always maps to the same public IP.
- Useful when:
  - External users need consistent access to internal services (e.g., web server).
- 🧱 NAT hides internal IP but still allows inbound connections.

---

### 🔄 Dynamic NAT
- NAT uses a **pool of public IPs**.
- When a host needs Internet access, NAT picks an available public IP and maps it.
- When the session ends or times out, the public IP is returned to the pool.
- ⚠️ Mapping is temporary and session-based.
- More scalable than static NAT.

### 🔍 Summary

| Type        | Mapping           | Scalability | Use Case                            |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Static NAT  | 1:1 fixed          | Low         | Host needing consistent public IP   |
| Dynamic NAT | Pool, session-based| High        | Shared public IPs for many users    |
