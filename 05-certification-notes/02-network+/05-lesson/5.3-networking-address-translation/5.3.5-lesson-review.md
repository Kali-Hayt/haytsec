# QUESTION 1 of 10  
What happens to the packets returned from the Internet in a PAT configuration?

❌ They are broadcast to all internal hosts.  
✅ They undergo reverse mapping to insert the original IP address and port number.  
❌ They are stored in a buffer until the correct host requests them.  
❌ They are discarded if they do not match an existing port mapping.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Broadcast**: PAT does not broadcast return traffic—it sends it only to the matching internal host.
- ❌ **Stored in a buffer**: There's no waiting buffer for incoming packets in PAT. They’re either mapped or dropped.
- ❌ **Discarded if unmatched**: This only happens if there’s *no* mapping—reverse mapping works *when* there is one.

# QUESTION 2  
Kate, a network administrator, has been tasked with staying within the company budget. She needs to allow internal users to access the internet, but wants to limit the number of registered IP addresses.

✅ Use Network Address Translation.  
❌ Use Layer 3 switches.  
❌ Use Layer 2 switches.  
❌ Use PoE devices.

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Layer 3 switches**: Handle internal routing, not public IP conservation.  
- ❌ **Layer 2 switches**: Operate at the data link layer, not used for routing or NAT.  
- ❌ **PoE devices**: Deliver power over Ethernet, unrelated to IP translation or public IP usage.

# QUESTION 3

What is the primary function of Port Address Translation (PAT)?

- ✅ To map multiple private IP addresses onto a single public IP address  
- ❌ To allocate a unique public IP address to each internal host  
- ❌ To block unwanted traffic from the Internet  
- ❌ To encrypt data packets for secure transmission over the Internet  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ Allocating unique public IPs defeats the purpose of PAT—PAT exists because public IPs are limited.
- ❌ Blocking traffic is the job of firewalls, not NAT/PAT.
- ❌ Encryption is handled by protocols like SSL/TLS, not by PAT.

# QUESTION 4  
What is the primary role of an edge router in a network?

❌ To manage internal network traffic only  
✅ To connect internal networks to external networks  
❌ To provide Wi-Fi connectivity to internal users  
❌ To serve as the main firewall for the network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ *Manage internal traffic only*: That’s more the job of core/internal routers or Layer 3 switches. Edge routers focus on *external* communication.
- ❌ *Provide Wi-Fi*: That’s an access point's job, not a router’s.
- ❌ *Serve as main firewall*: While many routers have firewall features, dedicated firewalls usually handle that. Routers connect networks; firewalls filter traffic.

# QUESTION 5

A network technician is looking at the interfaces on an edge router. The technician comes across a customer's router.  
What is this side of the interface called?

- ❌ SOHO  
- ✅ CE  
- ❌ PE  
- ❌ WAN  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **SOHO**: Stands for small office/home office — it’s a type of network setup, not a specific router interface role.
- ❌ **PE**: Provider Edge router lives **on the ISP’s side**, not at the customer end.
- ❌ **WAN**: Wide Area Network is a **type of network**, not a name for the customer’s router interface.

✅ **Explanation**:  
The CE (Customer Edge) router sits at the boundary of the **customer’s network** and connects to the **service provider’s network**. It’s your router in the company — talking to the provider’s PE router. That CE interface is what the tech is inspecting.  
Think of CE as **“your side of the handshake.”**

# QUESTION 6

**Which of the following is another term for Port Address Translation (PAT)?**

- ❌ Static NAT  
- ❌ ARP spoofing  
- ❌ Dynamic NAT  
- ✅ NAT overloading

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Static NAT** – This maps one private IP address to one public IP address without using ports. It doesn’t scale well and is not PAT.
- ❌ **ARP spoofing** – Not related to NAT at all. It’s a Layer 2 attack where an attacker sends fake ARP messages to associate their MAC with another device's IP.
- ❌ **Dynamic NAT** – Assigns a public IP from a pool to private IPs but does **not** track sessions using port numbers. Still one-to-one, just not fixed.

✅ **NAT Overloading** is the *same thing* as PAT. It maps many private IPs to a single public IP using **port numbers** to keep track. It’s also called **NAPT** (Network Address Port Translation).

# QUESTION 7

**Which of the following problems does NAT help address?**

- ❌ Registering IP addresses with an ISP  
- ❌ The shortage of IPv6 addresses  
- ✅ The shortage of IPv4 addresses  
- ❌ IPsec not working properly

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Registering IP addresses with an ISP** – NAT doesn't affect registration. That’s handled contractually and administratively with the ISP.
- ❌ **The shortage of IPv6 addresses** – IPv6 has **plenty** of addresses (128-bit space). NAT was never meant for IPv6.
- ❌ **IPsec not working properly** – In fact, NAT can **cause** problems with IPsec, especially with AH (Authentication Header) because NAT modifies IP headers.

✅ **The shortage of IPv4 addresses** – That’s the whole reason NAT was invented. It lets many internal (private) hosts share a single public IPv4 address.

# QUESTION 8

**Which type of router would be most suitable for this purpose?**

- ❌ Core router  
- ❌ Virtual router  
- ❌ Wireless router  
- ✅ Edge router

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Core router** – These are used in the backbone of the network, not at the branch-office level. Overkill for this job.
- ❌ **Virtual router** – Software-based routers work in cloud or virtualized environments. Not ideal for a branch's physical WAN link.
- ❌ **Wireless router** – Good for local Wi-Fi, not for managing WAN-to-LAN traffic for enterprise setups.

✅ **Edge router** – This is the *correct* device for handling traffic between the internal LAN and the outside WAN. It sits at the "edge" of the network, facing the internet.

---
# QUESTION 9

**In which of the following tables does a NAT router store port numbers and their associated private IP address mappings?**

✅ Translation table  
❌ MAC address table  
❌ Routing table  
❌ ARP table  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **MAC address table** – Used by Ethernet switches to associate MAC addresses with ports, not IPs or ports.
- ❌ **Routing table** – Guides packet forwarding between networks, but doesn’t handle address translation.
- ❌ **ARP table** – Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, nothing to do with port-to-IP mappings.

✅ **Translation table** – This is the mapping table NAT uses to associate internal private IPs with external ports, so it knows how to route return traffic back to the correct host.

# QUESTION 10

**You want to configure the server as a web server and allow internet hosts to contact the server to browse a personal website. What should you use to allow access to this configuration?**

- ❌ Dynamic NAT  
- ❌ DNS CNAME record  
- ✅ Static NAT  
- ❌ DNS A record  
- ❌ Multicast

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Dynamic NAT** – Assigns public IPs from a pool dynamically. That’s not what you want for a consistent, inbound connection to a single server.
- ❌ **DNS CNAME record** – That’s for aliasing domain names, not mapping public-to-private IPs.
- ❌ **DNS A record** – Points a domain to an IP address, but does not handle NAT or IP translations.
- ❌ **Multicast** – Used for one-to-many transmission, not for making a web server reachable via NAT.

✅ **Static NAT** – You need consistent, one-to-one mapping between a public IP (or port) and the internal server’s private IP. That’s exactly what Static NAT is made for.
