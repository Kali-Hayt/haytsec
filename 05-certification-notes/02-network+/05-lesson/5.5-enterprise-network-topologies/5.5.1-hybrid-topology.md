## 5.5.1 â€“ Hybrid Topology

The **network topology** defines how nodes are physically and logically connected.

### ðŸ§± Basic Topologies

- **Point-to-point**  
  A one-to-one link between two hosts only.

- **Star**  
  One-to-many links. Each node relies on a **central forwarding device** (like a switch) to communicate.

- **Mesh**  
  Many-to-many links. Each node has **multiple interfaces and cable paths** to other nodes, allowing redundancy.

### âœ… Hybrid Topology

A **hybrid topology** combines two or more basic topologies (point-to-point, star, mesh) into a single physical and/or logical network.  
This is commonly used when basic topologies can't meet modern demands like:

- Redundancy  
- Fault tolerance  
- WAN site connections  
- Enterprise-level design

### Examples of Hybrid Topologies

- **Hierarchical Star (Tree Topology)**  
  Corporate networks often use this. Each node in the tree may follow a **star pattern**, but the overall structure is hierarchical.  
  - Backbone/trunk links connect different levels.
  - Common in enterprise LANs.

- **Hierarchical Star-Mesh**  
  Nodes at the top (core) form a **partial or full mesh** for redundancy.  
  Lower layers (access/distribution) form star topologies to end systems.  
  Think: mesh up top, star down below.

- **Star of Stars (Snowflake Topology)**  
  A WAN scenario where each **site uses a star**, and all stars are connected in a hub-and-spoke model.  
  - Central office = hub  
  - Branch offices = spokes  
  - Each branch is its own star topology

## Summary

- Hybrid topologies are the backbone of scalable and resilient networks.
- Mixing physical and logical structures allows network engineers to adapt to complex use cases.
- Most modern enterprise networks use some form of hybrid design.
