## 5.5.2 – Three-Tiered Network Hierarchy

A **hierarchical network model** breaks down a large, complex network into smaller, functional sections.  
This helps designers choose efficient hardware/software for each layer.

Many enterprise networks follow Cisco’s **three-tiered design**, made of:

- **Access (Edge) Layer**
- **Distribution (Aggregation) Layer**
- **Core Layer**

---

### Access / Edge Layer

The access layer **connects end-user devices** (computers, printers, smartphones) to the network.  

- Uses structured cabling and wall ports for wired, and APs for wireless.
- Devices connect to **workgroup switches** (aka LAN or data switches).
- Star topology is used—**no direct links between access switches**.
- Focus: enabling device access, not routing or policy enforcement.

---

### Distribution / Aggregation Layer

This layer provides **fault-tolerant interconnects** between access layers and the core.

- Access switches link to **Layer 3 switches or routers** at this layer.
- Handles **routing boundaries, filtering, and QoS policies**.
- **Layer 3 switches** are optimized with **ASICs** (application-specific integrated circuits).
  - Faster than routers, but often limited in flexibility (e.g., no WAN protocols).
  - Typical ports:
    - 10 Gbps access
    - 40–100 Gbps uplink/backbone
- Uses the "route once, switch many" principle—efficient after path discovery.

---

### Core Layer

Acts as the **network backbone**. Must be **highly available and redundant**.

- **No end-user devices** should connect directly to core.
- Designed to be simple, fast, and resilient.
- Uses **full mesh topology** among core/distribution layer switches.
- Focus: enable fast, uninterrupted transit across the network.

---

### Collapsed Core

Used in **medium-sized networks** that don’t need a distinct distribution layer.

- Combines **core + distribution** into a single tier.
- Implemented as a **monolithic full mesh**.
- Not ideal for very large environments—**reduced scalability**.
