## 5.1.4 ‚Äì Packet Forwarding

When a router receives a packet, it does three key things:
1. Reads the **destination IP address**
2. Checks its **routing table** for a match
3. Forwards the packet out the appropriate interface, **re-encapsulating** it in a new frame

---

### üì® Forwarding Scenarios

- **Forward to directly connected device (same subnet):**
  - Uses **ARP (IPv4)** or **ND (IPv6)** to find the MAC address.
  - Builds a new Ethernet frame for the next hop.

- **Forward to next-hop router (gateway):**
  - Uses the **MAC of the next-hop router** as destination.
  - Sets its own interface MAC as source.

- **Forward via non-Ethernet interface (e.g. DSL, leased line):**
  - Re-encapsulates the packet in that interface‚Äôs protocol (e.g., PPP).

- **No match in routing table?**
  - Uses **default route** (if available).
  - Otherwise: **drops the packet** and notifies the source (ICMP unreachable).

### üîÅ Hop Count

Each **router** the packet crosses = **1 hop**.  
Switches **don‚Äôt** count.

- Host A ‚Üí 1 hop to reach local server.
- Host B ‚Üí 9 hops to reach REMOTE_SRV through ISP routers.

Hop count is a basic **routing metric** used in RIP and similar protocols.

### ‚è≥ Time to Live (TTL)

- TTL starts as a number (often 64 or 128)
- **Decrements by 1 at each router**
- If TTL = 0 ‚Üí packet is **discarded**
- Prevents packets from looping endlessly

üß† IPv6 uses the term **Hop Limit** instead of TTL to reflect that it‚Äôs **count-based**, not time-based.

### üß† Summary

| Concept          | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Forwarding       | Moving a packet toward its destination via the next hop      |
| ARP / ND         | Resolves IP ‚Üí MAC for local delivery                         |
| Hop Count        | Routers crossed; switches don‚Äôt count                        |
| TTL / Hop Limit  | Prevents infinite loops; decrements each hop                 |
| No route match   | Default route used, or packet is dropped                     |
