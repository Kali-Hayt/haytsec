## 5.1.5 â€“ Fragmentation

### ðŸ“¦ What Is Fragmentation?

When an IP packet is **too big** to fit within the **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)** of the underlying Data Link layer, it must be **fragmented**â€”split into smaller chunks that fit.

> Example: Ethernet has a default MTU of **1500 bytes**.  
If an IP datagram is larger than that, it must be broken up into multiple frames.

### ðŸ§  Fragmentation in IPv4

IPv4 handles fragmentation at the **router** level using these header fields:
- **Identification (ID)** â€“ Identifies which fragments belong together.
- **Flags** â€“ Indicates if more fragments follow.
- **Fragment Offset** â€“ Shows where each piece fits in the original datagram.

Routers may fragment large packets if a smaller MTU is detected along the path.

### ðŸš« Fragmentation in IPv6

- IPv6 **does not allow routers to fragment** packets.
- Instead, the **host** performs **Path MTU Discovery**:
  - Probes the path to find the smallest MTU.
  - Sends IP packets **small enough to avoid fragmentation entirely**.

This reduces router workload and makes network performance more predictable.

---

### ðŸ§± Why Fragmentation Happens

- IP is **connectionless** and **best-effort**â€”it doesnâ€™t know the whole path up front.
- Different media types (Ethernet, PPP, Wi-Fi) have different **frame sizes (MTUs)**.
- IP fragmentation allows packets to be delivered **even when sizes donâ€™t match**.

### ðŸ›  Real-World Effects

- Fragmented packets can lead to:
  - Slower performance
  - Firewall issues (many block fragments)
  - Packet loss or reassembly problems
- **Modern networks try to avoid fragmentation** by:
  - Using smaller packet sizes
  - Relying on **TCP segmentation**
  - Performing **Path MTU Discovery**
