# QUESTION 1

What is the purpose of inspecting the ARP cache table?

- ❌ To view the device's routing table  
- ✅ To discover duplicate IP addresses and misconfigurations  
- ❌ To modify the device's IP address  
- ❌ To increase the router's memory  

Why the others are wrong:
- **Routing table** shows network paths, not IP-to-MAC mappings.
- You **can’t change an IP** via ARP cache—it's read-only diagnostics.
- **Router memory** isn’t affected by ARP—it’s a protocol function, not hardware expansion.

# QUESTION 2

What is the purpose of applying an IP configuration to each interface on a router?

- ✅ To enable the router to serve its function in routing data  
- ❌ To increase the storage capacity of the router  
- ❌ To secure the router from external threats  
- ❌ To enhance the processing power of the router  

Why the others are wrong:
- Routers don’t gain **more storage** from IPs—IP config just defines the network.
- **Security** comes from firewall rules, ACLs, VPNs—not from assigning IPs.
- **Processing power** is hardware-dependent, not influenced by IP configuration.

# QUESTION 3

A network technician is using traceroute on a corporate network to make use of ICMP "Time Exceeded" in order to identify routers along a delivery path.  
What is the TCP/IP feature that traceroute uses to accomplish this?

- ❌ Static route  
- ✅ Time To Live (TTL) header field  
- ❌ Default route  
- ❌ Fragmentation  

Why the others are wrong:
- **Static route** defines a manual path but doesn't control how many hops a packet can make.
- **Default route** is used when no specific route is known—not related to hop counting or ICMP.
- **Fragmentation** is about breaking large packets into smaller ones—not tracking paths or routers.

🧱 TTL is the key: each hop reduces TTL by 1, and when it hits 0, the router sends back an ICMP "Time Exceeded"—this is what traceroute captures.

# QUESTION 4

Which of the following best describes a directly connected route in a routing table?

✅ A route that is automatically added for each active router interface, representing subnets for which the router has a local interface  
❌ A route for subnets and IP networks that are not directly attached to the router  
❌ A special type of static route that serves as the gateway of last resort  
❌ A route that is manually added and requires manual updates  

Why the others are wrong:
- **A route for subnets and IP networks not directly attached** describes remote or learned routes, not directly connected ones.
- **A special type of static route…gateway of last resort** describes a **default route**, not a directly connected one.
- **Manually added and requires manual updates** describes a **static route**, not one that’s auto-populated from an active interface.

🧱 Directly connected routes appear the moment an interface is configured with an IP and is **up/up**—the router knows it's directly responsible for that network.

# QUESTION 5

Which command outputs the active routing table and includes details such as destination, gateway, and the source of the route?

❌ **show arp**  
❌ **route print**  
❌ **ip route show**  
✅ **show route**

Why the others are wrong:
- **show arp** ❌ This only displays the ARP cache (MAC-to-IP mappings), not routing details.
- **route print** ❌ Windows-only command that shows basic routes but not route source info like a router would.
- **ip route show** ❌ This Linux command shows the routing table but lacks rich router-specific fields like route *source*, which `show route` provides.
  
✅ **show route** is a command used on network routers (especially in Cisco/Juniper environments) that gives a complete routing table with info on:
- Destination networks
- Gateway/Next Hop
- Outgoing Interface
- Administrative Distance / Metric
- Route Source (e.g., static, OSPF, BGP, etc.)

🧱 This is the full router-level view needed when troubleshooting routes across networks—not just basic host routing.

# QUESTION 7

How does IPv6 handle packet fragmentation differently from IPv4?

✅ IPv6 requires the host to perform path MTU discovery.  
❌ IPv6 allows routers to perform fragmentation.  
❌ IPv6 increases the MTU to avoid fragmentation.  
❌ IPv6 uses a different header field for fragmentation management.

Why the others are wrong:
- **IPv6 allows routers to perform fragmentation** ❌ Not true—IPv6 *removes* router fragmentation entirely. Routers no longer chop packets. That’s the host’s job now.
- **IPv6 increases the MTU to avoid fragmentation** ❌ There's no MTU increase baked into the protocol. Instead, hosts must figure out the smallest MTU along the path.
- **IPv6 uses a different header field** ❌ Actually, IPv6 uses a separate *extension header* for fragmentation—not just a new field in the standard header. But the key difference is *who* fragments: the host, not the router.

🔍 **Path MTU Discovery**: The host sends probe packets and uses ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" messages to find the max MTU along the route.

✅ IPv6 pushes fragmentation logic to the edge, reducing router overhead.

# QUESTION 8

What is the default probe message type used by the `tracert` command on Windows systems?

✅ ICMP Echo Request  
❌ ARP Request  
❌ TCP SYN  
❌ UDP

Why the others are wrong:
- **ARP Request** ❌ That's layer 2. `tracert` works at layer 3 (IP). ARP resolves MAC addresses, not hops across routers.
- **TCP SYN** ❌ Tools like `tcptraceroute` use this, but *not* the built-in Windows `tracert`.
- **UDP** ❌ This is the default for Unix/Linux `traceroute`, not Windows. Different OS, different defaults.

✅ **Windows `tracert` sends ICMP Echo Requests**, incrementing the TTL to trace the path through routers. Each router along the way replies with "ICMP Time Exceeded" until the destination finally responds to the Echo Request itself.

---
# QUESTION 9

What is the role of the Gateway/next hop parameter in a routing table?

✅ It indicates the next router or gateway along the path to the destination.  
❌ It specifies the final destination of the packet.  
❌ It identifies the router's physical location.  
❌ It determines the speed at which the packet is forwarded.

Why the others are wrong:
- **It specifies the final destination of the packet** ❌ Wrong scope. The **destination IP** handles that, not the *gateway/next hop* field.
- **It identifies the router's physical location** ❌ Not relevant to routing. There's no GPS here—just logical IP paths.
- **It determines the speed at which the packet is forwarded** ❌ Speed is handled by interface bandwidth/clock rate, not the routing table itself.

✅ The *next hop* is the **immediate device** to send the packet to on its journey to the final destination. Think of it like saying, “Ask the next person in line where to go next.”

---
# QUESTION 10

What does the Time to Live (TTL) header field represent in a packet?

✅ The maximum number of routers the packet can pass through  
❌ The maximum distance the packet can travel  
❌ The maximum time the packet can exist on the network  
❌ The priority assigned to the packet for data transmission

Why the others are wrong:
- **The maximum distance the packet can travel** ❌ Misleading—TTL isn't about *distance*, it's about hops (routers).
- **The maximum time the packet can exist on the network** ❌ TTL *used to* be time-based, but in practice it's now decremented by **routers**, not seconds.
- **The priority assigned to the packet for data transmission** ❌ That’s handled by QoS fields like DSCP, not TTL.

✅ The TTL field is a *counter* that starts at a set number (like 64 or 128) and drops by 1 at each router hop. If it hits 0, the packet gets dropped—preventing it from looping endlessly.
