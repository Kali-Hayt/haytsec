## 5.1.1 ‚Äì Routing Tables and Path Selection

Routers are the **air traffic controllers** of the network. They use routing tables to decide the best path for forwarding packets to their destinations‚Äîjust like pilots rely on air traffic maps.

### üß± What is a Routing Table?

A **routing table** is a database inside a router that lists known networks and how to reach them.  
Each entry (called a *routing entry*) provides instructions for sending traffic toward a destination network or host.

### üß© Key Routing Table Fields

- **Protocol**  
  - Where the route came from.  
  - Examples:  
    - `C` = Connected  ==a method where a router adds directly connected networks to its routing table based on the configuration of its interfaces==
    
	- `S` = Static  ==a networking method where network administrators manually configure routes on routers, specifying the path data packets should take to reach specific destinations==.
    
	- `D` = EIGRP  ==Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, is a Cisco-proprietary distance-vector routing protocol known for its fast convergence and efficient path selection. It utilizes the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to calculate the shortest paths to network destinations and offers features like equal-cost and unequal-cost load balancing.
    
	- `O` = OSPF  (Open Shortest Path First) is ==a link-state routing protocol used to distribute routing information within a single autonomous system==
  
  - Routes can be manually set (static) or learned (dynamic).

- **Destination**  
  - The target network or host.
  - Uses **CIDR notation** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/30`)
  - üîç **Longest match wins**: The most specific (longest prefix) match is chosen if multiple apply.

- **Interface**  
  - The **local exit** port or interface the packet should leave through.
  - Example: `GigabitEthernet1/0/3`

- **Gateway / Next Hop**  
  - The IP of the **next router** in the path toward the destination.
  - This acts like a **stepping stone** to reach the target network.

### üß† Special Note on Host Routes

- **IPv4 host route** = `/32` (one single IP address)
- **IPv6 host route** = `/128`
- Often used for specific host-level routing or anycast.

### üß™ Sample Command: `show ip route`

```plaintext
D 10.0.0.0/30 [90/3584] via 10.0.0.14, 00:05:41, GigabitEthernet1/0/4
C 10.0.0.4/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet1/0/2
S* 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 10.254.0.254
```

- `D` = Learned via EIGRP
    
- `C` = Directly connected
    
- `S*` = Static route, default route (`0.0.0.0/0`)
    
- `[90/3584]` = [Administrative Distance / Metric]
---
### üìò Routing Decision Logic

üß± Layered like envelopes in a postal system:

- If multiple routes match ‚Üí router chooses the most **specific** (longest prefix)
    
- If same prefix ‚Üí chooses the **lowest metric**
    
- If same metric ‚Üí may load balance or follow protocol behavior
---
### üîç Exam & Real-World Notes

- The `show ip route` output is **Cisco-style**‚Äîknow how to read it.
    
- The **default route** (`0.0.0.0/0`) is used as a **gateway of last resort**
    
- Don't confuse **interface** with **gateway**‚Äîthey serve different steps.
