## 5.1.7 – Routing Table Tools

Various CLI tools are used to **inspect** and **manipulate** the routing table on both routers and hosts.

---

### 🧭 `show route`

Used on routers (Cisco, VyOS, JunOS, etc.)

Commands:
- `show route`
- `show ip route`
- `show ipv6 route`

Output displays:
- Destination network
- Next hop / gateway
- Interface
- AD/Metric
- Route source:
  - `C` = Connected
  - `S` = Static
  - `R` = RIP
  - `O` = OSPF
  - `B` = BGP
  - `D` = EIGRP

---

### 🛠 `show arp`

- Displays the **ARP cache**, showing resolved IP ↔ MAC mappings
- Useful for:
  - Detecting IP conflicts
  - Verifying gateway MACs
  - Debugging routing misconfigurations

Command:
- `show arp`
- `show ip arp`

If entries are “incomplete,” it means an ARP request was sent but no reply was received.

---

### 💻 `route` and `ip route` (Windows & Linux)

Used to view or modify **local host routing tables**.

- `route print` – (Windows) shows local routing table
- `route add`, `route delete` – to edit routes
- `ip route show` – (Linux) shows active routes
- `ip route add` – adds new routes

🔎 Default route appears as `0.0.0.0/0`

Example (Linux):
```bash
ip route show
default via 10.11.2.5 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 10.11.2.66 metric 100
10.11.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.11.2.66 metric 100
```
