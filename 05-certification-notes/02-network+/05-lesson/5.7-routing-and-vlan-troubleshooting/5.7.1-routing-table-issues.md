## 5.7.1 Routing Table Issues

### üß† When to Suspect Routing Issues

If you **can ping the default gateway** but **not remote hosts**, this typically points to a **routing issue**.  
Common cause:  
- A router is down or unreachable  
- No alternative path to the destination network exists  

‚úÖ Check:  
- Router is powered on  
- Cabling and interfaces are configured with correct IPs  
- Interfaces are up and active  

If all physical settings are correct ‚Üí move on to **routing topology troubleshooting**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Diagnostic Tools

- Use `traceroute` to identify **where** in the path the failure occurs  
- Use `route` or `show route` to inspect the **routing tables** of intermediate systems

Command:
```bash
show ip route w.x.y.z
```
This checks if a specific destination has a valid route.

### üîç Causes of Missing Routes

- Static route missing or misconfigured  
- Router isn‚Äôt receiving updates from neighbors (e.g., routing protocol failure)  
- Connectivity failure to neighboring routers (check with `ping`)  
- Misconfigured routing protocol (wrong authentication or parameters)

### üß± Route Selection Rules

1. **Longest Prefix Wins**  
   - The most specific subnet is preferred  
   - e.g., `/28` beats `/24` for addresses in `.1 to .30`

2. **Lowest Administrative Distance (AD)**  
   - Lower AD = more trusted  
   - Directly connected and static routes have the **lowest AD**

3. **Lowest Metric Wins (if AD is equal)**  
   - Metric = path cost (depends on protocol: hop count, bandwidth, etc.)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch for Overlaps

Check for **overlapping prefixes** (e.g., `/24` vs `/28`) coming from:
- Different sources  
- Static vs. dynamic conflicts  

üîç These often signal **misconfiguration** or priority conflict between routes.
