### 🔐 Selecting a Firewall

When choosing a firewall, consider:
- **Network size**
- **Performance needs**
- **What needs protecting**
- **Management capabilities**

Small businesses might use a **SOHO firewall**, while enterprises need **high-throughput UTM appliances** or **cloud-based firewalls**.

### 🧱 Hardware vs. Software Firewalls

#### ✅ Hardware Firewall
- Dedicated appliance
- Usually placed at **network perimeter**
- Handles high-volume traffic
- Protects **entire networks**

#### ✅ Software Firewall
- Installed on individual hosts
- Controls traffic **to/from that specific machine**
- Useful for laptops, personal devices, remote users

---

### 🧭 Firewall Placement

- 🔸 **Ingress filtering**: placed between the internal network and external network (e.g. internet).  
- 🔸 **Egress filtering**: monitors traffic **leaving** the network — prevents data exfiltration.

Firewalls can be placed:
- At the **perimeter**
- Between **internal segments** (e.g., DMZ)
- On **individual devices**

---

### 🧠 Key Considerations

- **Single firewall**: Simpler to manage, but risk of single point of failure.
- **Multiple firewalls**: Layered security (defense in depth), but requires more management.
- Consider **redundancy**, **throughput**, and **policy management**.
