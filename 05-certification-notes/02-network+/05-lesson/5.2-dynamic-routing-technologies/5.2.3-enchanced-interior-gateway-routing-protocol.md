# 5.2.3  
# Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

## Overview  
- ✅ **EIGRP (Enhanced IGRP)** is a Cisco-developed **advanced distance vector protocol**.
- Evolved from **IGRP** to support **classless routing**, **IPv6**, and better performance.
- Combines the best of **distance vector** and **link-state** techniques (hybrid model).
- EIGRP uses **multiple metrics**, not just hop count.

## 🎯 Metrics (Composite Cost)
EIGRP uses **administrator-weighted metrics**. Two main default ones:

- **Bandwidth** — ✅ Picks path based on the **lowest bandwidth** link.
- **Delay** — ✅ Adds total **cumulative delay** across all links.

🧠 These metrics make EIGRP smarter for real-world needs like voice or video.

## 🔁 Update Behavior
- ✅ EIGRP **does not flood periodic updates** like RIP.
- Sends a **full table once**, then only sends updates when **topology changes**.
- Uses **"hello" messages** regularly to maintain neighbor connections.
- Far **less disruptive** on large networks, faster convergence ⚡.

|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Metric                | Bandwidth + Delay (composite)    | Hop count (single)                  |
| Updates               | Triggered only                   | Every 30 seconds                    |
| Hello Packets         | ✅ Yes                            | ❌ No                                |
| Topology Table        | ✅ Yes                            | ❌ No                                |
| Max Hops              | 255                              | 15                                  |
| Protocol Number       | 88 (in IP header)                | Uses UDP port 520                   |
| Transport             | Native IP (not TCP or UDP)       | UDP                                 |
| Addressing            | Multicast (efficient)            | Broadcast                           |

## 🧠 Internal Logic

EIGRP maintains **three tables**:
1. **Neighbor Table** – Tracks directly connected routers.
2. **Topology Table** – All known paths + metrics.
3. **Routing Table** – Best routes chosen from the topology.

✅ This structure prevents loops and speeds convergence.

---

## 🔒 Loop Prevention

- Uses the **Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)**:
  - Guarantees loop-free, backup-aware routes.
  - Fast recalculations without full table rebuild.

---

## 🛰️ Summary

- ✅ Smarter, faster, and more scalable than RIP.
- ✅ Uses **triggered updates**, **multiple metrics**, and **loop prevention via DUAL**.
- ✅ Perfect for **enterprise-class** networks, especially when speed and reliability matter.
- ❌ But: **Cisco-proprietary**, not ideal in mixed-vendor environments.
