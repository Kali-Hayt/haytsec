# QUESTION 1

Which type of border device is commonly configured with Network Address Translation (NAT) to facilitate communications between private and public networks?

❌ Hub  
❌ Modem  
✅ Router  
❌ Switch  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Hub**: Merely repeats electrical signals across ports. Has zero intelligence, can't do NAT or even recognize IP addresses.
- ❌ **Modem**: Converts digital data to analog for transmission, but does not handle NAT. It's a layer 1/2 device.
- ❌ **Switch**: Operates mostly at Layer 2 (MAC addresses). Some Layer 3 switches exist, but NAT is not their job.

# QUESTION 2

A small tech startup, TechInnovate, has recently moved to a new office and is in the process of setting up their internet connection. They have been allocated a single public IP address by their Internet Service Provider (ISP).  
The company has 25 employees, each with at least one device that needs to connect to the Internet. The IT manager decides to implement Port Address Translation (PAT) on their network router.

Given this scenario, which of the following outcomes is MOST likely to occur as a result of implementing PAT?

✅ All devices will be able to access the Internet simultaneously using the single public IP address.  
❌ Each device will be assigned a public IP address by the router.  
❌ Each device will be assigned a unique public IP address by the router.  
❌ Internet access will be limited to only one device at a time due to the single public IP address.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Public IPs for each device**: Not possible—ISP only gave them *one*.
- ❌ **Unique public IPs assigned by router**: Routers can’t generate public IPs out of thin air. Only ISP assigns them.
- ❌ **One-at-a-time access**: PAT is *designed* to allow *many-to-one* connections—using port numbers to track traffic.

PAT = “many devices share one IP, separated by port numbers.” That’s the whole trick.

# QUESTION 3

A rapidly growing tech startup is preparing to move its operations to a larger office space to accommodate its expanding team. The new office will have a significantly larger number of employees connecting to the network, including a mix of in-office and remote workers.  
The startup's IT team is tasked with ensuring that the network infrastructure supports seamless connectivity, robust security for sensitive data, and efficient management of internet traffic.

Considering these requirements, what aspect of an edge router should the IT team focus on when selecting a device for their new office?

❌ Integrated support for legacy communication protocols  
❌ Energy efficiency and low power consumption  
❌ Maximum throughput for internal LAN traffic  
✅ Ability to support a high number of simultaneous VPN connections  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Legacy protocols**: Modern startups rarely use outdated tech. Supporting old protocols doesn’t solve the remote work or security challenge.
- ❌ **Power efficiency**: That’s more of a data center or IoT concern—not top priority for a growing office.
- ❌ **Internal LAN throughput**: That’s a switch’s job, not the router’s. Edge routers manage *external* traffic and VPNs.

✅ Remote workers need secure tunnels. VPN support with high concurrent connections is the key spec here.

# QUESTION 4

What does a router use to determine the Data Link layer address of the destination interface when a packet can be delivered to a directly connected network? (Select two.)

✅ ARP  
✅ Neighbor Discovery  
❌ BGP  
❌ DHCP  
❌ ICMP  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Used for *routing between autonomous systems* on the Internet, not for resolving MAC addresses.
- ❌ **DHCP**: Assigns IP addresses, not used to resolve layer 2 addresses for packet delivery.
- ❌ **ICMP**: Used for diagnostic and control messages (e.g., ping), not address resolution.

✅ **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: IPv4’s go-to for mapping IP to MAC addresses on local networks.  
✅ **Neighbor Discovery (ND)**: IPv6’s version of ARP—it handles MAC resolution and more (like router discovery).

# QUESTION 5

A company has multiple VLANs configured on their network. Users in VLAN40 report that they can access local resources within their VLAN but cannot access resources in VLAN50 or the internet.  
The network administrator verifies that the switch and router configurations are correct.  

What should the administrator check next?

✅ Verify that inter-VLAN routing is enabled on the router.  
❌ Ensure that the DNS server is reachable from VLAN40.  
❌ Confirm that VLAN40 and VLAN50 are using the same subnet.  
❌ Check if the DHCP server is assigning IP addresses to VLAN40.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **DNS server reachability**: This only affects *name resolution*. Even if DNS fails, devices can reach others via IP. That’s not the core problem here.
- ❌ **Same subnet for VLANs**: VLANs are **intentionally** on different subnets. Putting them on the same one defeats VLAN separation.
- ❌ **DHCP check**: Since VLAN40 devices have local access, they clearly have valid IPs. DHCP isn’t the problem.

✅ Inter-VLAN routing is what allows communication between VLANs. Without it, VLAN40 can't reach VLAN50 or external networks.

---
# QUESTION 6

Why should user data traffic be avoided over the default VLAN?

✅ It increases the risk of data breaches.  
❌ It is not supported by most switches.  
❌ It can cause IP address conflicts.  
❌ It is reserved for management traffic.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Not supported by most switches**: Actually, default VLANs (like VLAN 1) are supported by nearly all managed switches.
- ❌ **IP address conflicts**: This is unrelated to VLAN usage—IP conflicts are more about DHCP mismanagement or duplicate statics.
- ❌ **Reserved for management traffic**: While often used for management, it’s *not officially reserved*—you can configure another VLAN for management.

✅ Using the default VLAN for user traffic is risky because it's commonly targeted, used for switch management, and lacks segmentation. Keeping user traffic off it helps reduce attack surfaces.

---
# QUESTION 7

What would you recommend as an interior gateway routing protocol that calculates routes using a metric weighted on lowest bandwidth cost combined with delay time, and that only sends updates to neighbors when the topology has changed?

✅ Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP)  
❌ Routing Information Protocol (RIP)  
❌ Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)  
❌ Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **RIP**: Uses hop count only—no delay or bandwidth considerations. Super basic, limited to 15 hops max.
- ❌ **OSPF**: Uses cost based on bandwidth, but doesn't consider delay. Also sends updates differently (LSAs, not just to neighbors).
- ❌ **BGP**: It's an *exterior* gateway protocol (EGP), used for internet-scale routing, not internal LANs.

✅ **EIGRP**: Cisco-proprietary IGP that uses a composite metric: bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load. It only sends updates when the topology changes—fast and efficient. Ideal match for the scenario.

---
# QUESTION 8

An expanding e-commerce business is experiencing rapid growth in online transactions. With this growth comes an increased risk of cyber threats, including sophisticated attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in active connections. The business's current firewall setup is proving inadequate for the complexity and volume of transactions.

The security team is tasked with upgrading the firewall to better protect customer data and ensure secure, uninterrupted online transactions. The team needs a solution that can intelligently manage and monitor the state of each connection, providing a balance between security and performance.

Which type of firewall should the security team implement to enhance protection for the expanding e-commerce business?

✅ **Stateful Inspection Firewall**  
❌ Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)  
❌ Web Application Firewall (WAF)  
❌ Packet Filtering Firewall  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**: Sounds high-tech, but it’s overkill for what this question asks. NGFWs offer app-layer filtering, threat intelligence, and deep packet inspection—good stuff, but not the best match for a “balance between performance and connection state tracking” as described here.
- ❌ **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Focuses only on HTTP/HTTPS traffic for websites and apps. It doesn’t manage or monitor general network sessions across the enterprise.
- ❌ **Packet Filtering Firewall**: Primitive. It only looks at headers—no state tracking, no context, no awareness of connection behavior. Way too basic for an e-commerce platform.

✅ **Stateful Inspection Firewall** tracks the state of active connections and allows only legitimate packets as part of an established session. It provides solid protection without the overhead of full NGFW features—an ideal upgrade for performance-conscious environments.

# QUESTION 9

What is a primary limitation of RIP due to its maximum hop count?

✅ It is unsuitable for large networks.  
❌ It cannot operate over wireless networks.  
❌ It does not support IPv6.  
❌ It cannot support high-bandwidth connections.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It cannot operate over wireless networks**: RIP isn’t limited by media type—it can work over wireless or wired.
- ❌ **It does not support IPv6**: RIPv2 doesn’t, but RIPng *does*. This isn’t the root issue.
- ❌ **It cannot support high-bandwidth connections**: RIP doesn't consider bandwidth at all—it only uses hop count, so this is misleading.

✅ **It is unsuitable for large networks**: RIP has a max hop count of **15**—anything beyond is considered unreachable. That’s a hard ceiling, making RIP impractical for large, enterprise-scale networks.

---
# QUESTION 10

Why might a stateless firewall introduce problems in traffic flow?

✅ Because it does not preserve information about connections  
❌ Because it only operates on outbound traffic  
❌ Because it inspects the content of every data packet  
❌ Because it encrypts every packet

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Because it only operates on outbound traffic**: Stateless firewalls analyze *all* traffic—both inbound and outbound. The issue isn’t direction.
- ❌ **Because it inspects the content of every data packet**: That’s closer to what deep packet inspection or NGFWs do. Stateless firewalls don't look deep.
- ❌ **Because it encrypts every packet**: Firewalls don’t handle encryption unless they’re part of a VPN solution.

✅ **Because it does not preserve information about connections**: Stateless firewalls evaluate packets individually with no memory of prior traffic. That means return traffic or multi-packet flows (like TCP handshakes) might get dropped or mishandled.

---
# QUESTION 11

Which type of port on a switch is essential for allowing a single physical connection to carry traffic for multiple VLANs between two switches?

✅ Trunk port  
❌ Access port  
❌ Untagged port  
❌ Host port

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Access port**: Handles traffic for only one VLAN—it's meant for end devices, not switch-to-switch links.
- ❌ **Untagged port**: Same idea as access—only carries untagged frames, so not for multiple VLANs.
- ❌ **Host port**: Not a real switch port type—probably a distractor.

✅ **Trunk port**: That’s the real deal. It can tag frames with 802.1Q headers, allowing multiple VLANs to share the same link between switches.

---
# QUESTION 12

Which firewall feature should the IT department implement to enhance outbound traffic security and prevent malware communication?

✅ Egress Filtering  
❌ Encryption  
❌ Deep Packet Inspection  
❌ Ingress Filtering

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encryption**: Secures data in transit but doesn’t control what leaves your network. Malware can encrypt data too—so this won’t help detect or block it.
- ❌ **Deep Packet Inspection**: Useful for analyzing traffic but not specifically designed for blocking outbound comms based on policies.
- ❌ **Ingress Filtering**: Controls *incoming* traffic; the question is about blocking *outgoing* (data exfiltration) traffic.

✅ **Egress Filtering**: Stops unauthorized outbound traffic from internal devices—essential for stopping malware from "calling home" or exfiltrating data.

---
# QUESTION 13

Which of the following issues is EduNet least likely to encounter due to using PAT in this scenario?

✅ Instructors being unable to access the server because it is on a private network  
❌ Instructors experiencing difficulty in establishing a connection to the server at the same time  
❌ The public IP address being easily identifiable and targeted for cyber attacks  
❌ A decrease in the quality of the webinar stream due to bandwidth limitations

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Instructors experiencing difficulty connecting at the same time**: PAT can create contention under heavy simultaneous load since it uses a limited port range.
- ❌ **Public IP targeted for attacks**: Since all traffic is visible through one public IP, it's more exposed and attractive to attackers.
- ❌ **Quality degradation due to bandwidth limits**: A single IP and shared outbound NAT can become a bottleneck, especially with high-bandwidth video streams.

✅ **Instructors being unable to access the server because it is on a private network**: This is least likely *because* PAT specifically enables access to internal private hosts from external networks by mapping ports—solving this exact issue.

# QUESTION 14

A medium-sized company is planning to redesign its network to improve efficiency and scalability. The network design team is considering whether to implement a traditional three-tiered network hierarchy or opt for a collapsed core model due to the company’s size.

The company expects moderate growth in the next few years but wants to ensure the network can handle increased traffic without significant redesigns.

Which network model should the design team choose?

✅ Traditional three-tiered network hierarchy  
❌ Full mesh topology at all layers  
❌ Collapsed core model  
❌ Single-layer access model  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Collapsed core model**: Tempting for small setups, but this can limit scalability. As traffic increases with growth, you'd eventually need to reintroduce a separate core—meaning a costly redesign.
- ❌ **Full mesh topology at all layers**: Complete overkill. It’s insanely expensive and complex to implement and maintain. Great for theory or military-grade networks, not mid-size business needs.
- ❌ **Single-layer access model**: Too simplistic. No separation of duties or redundancy. Wouldn't scale or meet performance goals for growing business traffic.

✅ **Traditional three-tiered network hierarchy** gives the right balance: scalable design, clear role separation (access, distribution, core), and future-proofing without jumping into enterprise-level overengineering.


---
# QUESTION 15

You notice that for a specific destination, a less specific route is being preferred over a more specific one.

What could be the reason?

✅ The more specific route has a higher administrative distance.  
❌ The cables are incorrectly connected.  
❌ The less specific route has a lower metric value.  
❌ The router is powered off.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The cables are incorrectly connected**: That would likely cause a loss of connectivity, not affect route preference logic.
- ❌ **The less specific route has a lower metric value**: Metrics apply **only when comparing routes from the same routing protocol**. Route specificity (longest prefix match) takes precedence first, then administrative distance, then metric.
- ❌ **The router is powered off**: If the router offering the more specific route were off, that route would simply be gone—not used with a higher admin distance.

✅ **The more specific route has a higher administrative distance**: The router sees it as less trustworthy than the broader one, so it chooses the less specific route—even though it's more general—because it's "more believable."

---
# QUESTION 16

Which protocol number is EIGRP tagged with in the Protocol field of the IP header?

✅ 88  
❌ 17  
❌ 89  
❌ 6  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **17**: That's the protocol number for **UDP**, not EIGRP.
- ❌ **89**: This is the protocol number for **OSPF**, not EIGRP.
- ❌ **6**: Protocol number **6** is used by **TCP**, not EIGRP.

✅ **88**: This is the correct IP protocol number for **EIGRP** (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) in the IP header.

---
# QUESTION 17

A network administrator is configuring a new switch for the office. The switch needs to support two VLANs: one for the office's general devices (VLAN 10) and another for the security cameras (VLAN 20). The administrator assigns ports 1–24 for VLAN 10 and ports 25–48 for VLAN 20.

After configuration, a security camera connected to port 26 cannot communicate with a server on port 5.

What is the MOST likely reason for this issue?

❌ The security camera is not compatible with VLAN 20.  
❌ The server on port 5 is malfunctioning.  
❌ The switch does not support VLANs.  
✅ VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 are not configured to communicate with each other.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **The security camera is not compatible with VLAN 20**: VLAN compatibility is a network configuration issue, not a hardware compatibility one—cameras don't "know" VLANs.
- ❌ **The server on port 5 is malfunctioning**: There's no evidence of hardware issues—only network segmentation.
- ❌ **The switch does not support VLANs**: The question clearly says VLANs were assigned to ports, so VLAN support exists.
  
✅ **Correct**: Ports 5 and 26 are in different VLANs (10 and 20), and inter-VLAN routing isn’t mentioned. By default, VLANs are isolated. Without a Layer 3 device (like a router or L3 switch) to handle inter-VLAN routing, they can’t talk to each other.

---
# QUESTION 18

Which layer of the three-tiered network hierarchy typically uses layer 3 capable switches?

✅ Distribution Layer  
❌ Access Layer  
❌ Core Layer  
❌ All of the above  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Access Layer**: Normally uses Layer 2 switches—think basic connectivity, like plugging users into the network. No routing logic here.
- ❌ **Core Layer**: While Layer 3 switches *can* be present, this layer is all about **speed and throughput**, not routing decisions or policy enforcement.
- ❌ **All of the above**: Sounds tempting, but misleading. Only the **distribution layer is specifically tasked with policy-based routing**, filtering, QoS, etc.

✅ **Distribution Layer**: This is the policy enforcement zone. It’s where VLANs get routed, ACLs are applied, and decisions are made—Layer 3 switches are expected here.


In IPv4, which header fields are used to manage packet fragmentation?

❌ Version, IHL, and Total Length  
❌ Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, and Checksum  
✅ ID, Flags, and Fragment Offset  
❌ Source IP, Destination IP, and TTL

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Version, IHL, and Total Length**: These fields help define the IP header layout and total size, but not fragmentation. They're general structure fields.
- ❌ **Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, and Checksum**: These belong to the **TCP** header, not IPv4. They're for managing **reliable transport**, not fragmentation.
- ❌ **Source IP, Destination IP, and TTL**: These identify endpoints and time-to-live (hop limit), not fragmentation control.

✅ Why “ID, Flags, and Fragment Offset” is correct:
- **Identification**: All fragments from the same original packet share the same ID.
- **Flags**: Includes the “More Fragments (MF)” bit and “Don't Fragment (DF)” bit.
- **Fragment Offset**: Indicates the position of this fragment within the original payload.

🧱 Think of fragmentation like tearing pages out of a book to mail them:
- **ID** = book title  
- **Flags** = "more pages coming" stamp  
- **Offset** = what page number this is

---
# QUESTION 20

What is a key characteristic of the devices used in the core layer?

❌ They implement traffic policies at the network's edge.  
❌ They are typically layer 2 only switches.  
❌ They connect end-user devices directly to the network.  
✅ They establish a full mesh topology with switches in distribution layer blocks.

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **They implement traffic policies at the network's edge**: That’s typically the **distribution** or **access** layer’s job. Core layer is about **speed and reliability**, not filtering.
- ❌ **They are typically layer 2 only switches**: Core layer switches are often **Layer 3** to support high-speed routing.
- ❌ **They connect end-user devices directly to the network**: That’s the **access layer** role.

✅ Why “They establish a full mesh topology with switches in distribution layer blocks” is correct:
- The core layer acts as the **backbone** of the network.
- It connects **multiple distribution layers**, providing fast, redundant paths.
- A **full mesh** here ensures **high availability and fault tolerance**, especially in enterprise networks.

🧱 Think of the core layer like the **highway system** connecting distribution hubs (distribution layer) — built for **speed, reliability, and redundancy**, not micromanagement.

# QUESTION 21

You are unsure if the gateway address is correct for one of your subnetworks because traffic is not leaving the network.  
Which of the following tables could you look at to check if the gateway address is correct?

❌ ARP table  
✅ Routing table  
❌ State table  
❌ MAC address table  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **ARP table**: This maps IP addresses to MAC addresses **within the local network**, not useful for checking if the **gateway address itself is correct**.
- ❌ **State table**: Used in stateful firewalls to track connection states—**not relevant** to routing decisions or default gateways.
- ❌ **MAC address table**: Used by switches to map MAC addresses to ports. It doesn’t tell you **anything** about **gateway IPs** or routing.

✅ Why “Routing table” is correct:
- The **routing table** contains information about the **default gateway** and how to reach **non-local networks**.
- You’ll see a `0.0.0.0/0` or `default` route pointing to the **next-hop IP** (usually the gateway). That’s where traffic exits the subnet.
- If the gateway IP is wrong or missing here, **traffic won’t leave the subnet**.

🧱 Routing table = the roadmap for traffic.

---
# QUESTION 22

You are troubleshooting a network where a host cannot reach any remote networks, but it can ping its default gateway.

What should be your first step in diagnosing the problem?

✅ Check if the router is powered on and the interface ports are correctly cabled.  
❌ Use the **show ip route** command to check the routing table for a specific route.  
❌ Replace the router with a new one.  
❌ Restart all devices on the network.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **show ip route**: This checks the routing table, which is a software/configuration-level check. It’s useful, but **not** your first step. Always start with hardware and connectivity.
- ❌ **Replace the router**: That’s jumping the gun. Replacing hardware before testing basics wastes time and effort.
- ❌ **Restart all devices**: Rebooting everything is a shotgun approach. Don’t reboot the entire network when the issue could be something obvious like a loose cable.

✅ The correct first step is checking **power and cabling**—basic physical layer checks (🧱 Layer 1). If your router isn’t powered or properly cabled, nothing else matters.


---
# QUESTION 23

What should be verified if you cannot ping any remote hosts during VLAN troubleshooting?

❌ That the host's firewall is disabled  
❌ The subnet mask of all devices in the VLAN  
✅ The switch and router configuration  
❌ That all devices have static IP addresses  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Host's firewall**: A firewall might block pings, but if **no hosts** can ping **any remote hosts**, it’s likely a **network-side VLAN config issue**, not host-side.
- ❌ **Subnet mask**: Important for intra-VLAN communication, but **not the first thing** when the entire VLAN has no remote access.
- ❌ **Static IPs**: Not all devices need static IPs. DHCP works just fine in VLANs—**what matters is that VLAN routing is set up**.

✅ Why "The switch and router configuration" is correct:
- Misconfigured VLANs often come from missing:
  - VLAN assignments on switch ports 🧱
  - Trunk ports not tagged properly between switches 🚪
  - Router-on-a-stick or inter-VLAN routing not configured 🛠
- If you can’t ping outside the VLAN, the problem likely lies in how traffic is being routed (or not routed).

🔍 **Start at the infrastructure, not the host.**

# QUESTION 24

Why do most systems try to avoid IP fragmentation?

❌ It enhances the transmission speed.  
❌ It increases data security.  
❌ It simplifies the routing process.  
✅ It can lead to packet loss or duplication.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Enhances transmission speed**: Fragmentation usually **slows things down**, not the other way around. Routers and hosts must process and reassemble fragments.
- ❌ **Increases data security**: Fragmentation actually **introduces risks**, like **evading firewalls or IDS** by splitting malicious payloads.
- ❌ **Simplifies routing**: Quite the opposite. Routing fragmented packets can **increase complexity** and sometimes **break MTU-limited paths**.

✅ Why “It can lead to packet loss or duplication” is correct:
- Each fragment must arrive for reassembly. If even **one fragment** is lost, the **entire packet is dropped**.  
- Some fragments can be **duplicated** in transit, causing overhead or processing issues.
- That’s why **Path MTU Discovery** exists: to avoid fragmentation altogether by negotiating optimal packet sizes before transmission.

🧱 IP fragmentation is fragile — it’s a patch, not a design goal.

---
# QUESTION 25

What is the primary function of Link State Advertisements (LSAs) in OSPF?

❌ To request specific routing information from neighbors  
❌ To authenticate OSPF messages  
❌ To announce the presence of a new router  
✅ To distribute routing and topology information  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Request specific routing info**: That’s more like what distance-vector protocols (like RIP) do. OSPF is **link-state**, meaning it shares **entire topology info**, not just routes on request.
- ❌ **Authenticate messages**: OSPF can use MD5 or other methods for authentication, but **LSAs themselves aren’t for authentication**—they’re for **topology updates**.
- ❌ **Announce new routers**: That might be part of what happens when LSAs are sent, but it’s not the **primary function**.

✅ Why “To distribute routing and topology information” is correct:
- LSAs are **flooded throughout the OSPF area** to inform all routers of:
  - Network links
  - Link costs
  - Router states
- These updates enable each router to **build a complete link-state database** (LSDB) and compute the best paths using **Dijkstra’s SPF algorithm**.

🧱 Think of LSAs as gossip: “Hey everyone, here’s what I’m connected to!”  
Routers use that gossip to **build the map**.

---
# QUESTION 26

Which of the following BEST describes the concept of a VLAN?

❌ Devices connected by a transmission medium other than a cable (such as microwave or radio transmissions)  
❌ Devices in separate networks logically grouped as if they were in the same network  
❌ Devices connected through the Internet that can communicate without using a network address  
✅ Devices on the same network logically grouped as if they were on separate networks  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Transmission medium (microwave/radio)**: That’s describing wireless communication, not VLANs. VLANs are about **logical separation**, not physical transmission.
- ❌ **Devices in separate networks grouped as one**: That sounds like a VPN or tunneling. VLANs **split up a single network**, not merge separate ones.
- ❌ **Internet devices without network addresses**: That’s nonsense—**every device needs an address** to communicate. Not relevant to VLANs.

✅ Why the correct answer is right:
- VLAN = **Virtual LAN**.
- It allows **devices on the same physical switch or LAN** to be logically split into different broadcast domains.
- So, even though they're on the same wire, VLANs **segregate traffic as if they were on totally different networks**.
- It’s **layer 2 segmentation** done with tagging (802.1Q).

🧱 Analogy: Think of a building with open office space. You put up **glass dividers** (VLANs) so teams can’t hear each other—even though they’re all in the same room.

# QUESTION 27

Which of the following destination addresses are used to represent a default route in IPv4 and IPv6 networks? (Select two.)

❌ 10.0.0.0/8  
❌ 255.255.255.0/32  
✅ 0.0.0.0/0  
✅ ::/0  
❌ ::1/128  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **10.0.0.0/8**: That's a **private address block**, not a default route.
- ❌ **255.255.255.0/32**: That’s a **host-specific subnet mask**, usually seen in configurations, not a route.
- ❌ **::1/128**: That’s the **IPv6 loopback address**—used for pinging yourself, not routing.

✅ Why the correct answers are right:
- ✅ **0.0.0.0/0**: This is the **default route in IPv4**, meaning “match any address.”
- ✅ **::/0**: This is the **default route in IPv6**, equivalent to 0.0.0.0/0.

🧱 Default route = "Send this to the gateway if there's no more specific match in the routing table."  
Like the “catch-all drawer” in your house for junk you don’t know where to put.

# QUESTION 28

A medium-sized enterprise has recently upgraded its network infrastructure to support increased traffic and to introduce redundancy for higher reliability. The network design includes multiple routers and redundant paths to ensure continuous connectivity even if a link fails.

However, after the upgrade, the network team has observed intermittent connectivity issues where certain data packets do not reach their intended destinations, especially immediately following a link failure or during network configuration changes.

This issue resolves itself after a short period but causes temporary disruptions to network services.

Based on this description, what is the most likely cause of the intermittent connectivity issues observed in the enterprise network?

✅ A black hole  
❌ Count to infinity  
❌ Route poisoning  
❌ Split horizon  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Count to infinity**: This describes a slow routing loop convergence issue in distance-vector protocols like RIP. But that’s not what's described here—this is a *temporary* drop during convergence.
- ❌ **Route poisoning**: This is a technique *used to prevent* routing loops, not a cause of dropped packets.
- ❌ **Split horizon**: Like route poisoning, it’s a *preventive mechanism*—not the cause of packet loss after a topology change.

✅ **Black hole** is the right answer. It happens when packets are sent toward a destination that’s no longer reachable due to routing tables not being fully updated. This is classic after a link failure or config change, especially in larger or complex topologies.

# QUESTION 29

Which VLAN IDs are referred to as the normal range?

✅ 2-1001  
❌ 1002-1005  
❌ 1006-4094  
❌ 1-1001  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **1002–1005**: These are reserved VLANs used for legacy technologies like FDDI and Token Ring. They are *not* considered part of the normal user-assignable range.
- ❌ **1006–4094**: This is the **extended range**, used in modern switches that support VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) version 3 or transparent mode.
- ❌ **1–1001**: VLAN 1 is the default VLAN. While technically configurable, it's **not recommended** for normal use because it's used for management and control plane traffic.

✅ The **normal VLAN range** is 2–1001. These IDs are fully available for standard segmentation in a typical enterprise network.

# QUESTION 30

What is the primary function of Port Address Translation (PAT)?

✅ To map multiple private IP addresses onto a single public IP address  
❌ To allocate a unique public IP address to each internal host  
❌ To block unwanted traffic from the Internet  
❌ To encrypt data packets for secure transmission over the Internet  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To allocate a unique public IP address to each internal host**: That describes **Static NAT**, not PAT. PAT shares one public IP with multiple internal clients.
- ❌ **To block unwanted traffic from the Internet**: That’s a job for **firewalls**, not PAT.
- ❌ **To encrypt data packets for secure transmission over the Internet**: That’s **VPN or IPsec**, not PAT.

✅ PAT conserves IPs by using different port numbers to keep track of multiple sessions from private addresses sharing one public IP.
