## **1.4.1 Network Troubleshooting Methodology**

**Step 1: Identify the Problem**
- Gather information  
- Question users  
- Identify symptoms  
- Determine if anything has changed  
- Duplicate the problem, if possible  
- Approach multiple problems individually  

**Step 2: Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**
- Question the obvious  
- Consider multiple approaches:  
  - Top-to-bottom/bottom-to-top OSI model  
  - Divide and conquer  

**Step 3: Test the Theory to Determine Cause**
- If confirmed: determine next steps to resolve problem  
- If not confirmed: establish new theory or escalate  

**Step 4: Establish a Plan of Action**
- Resolve the problem  
- Identify potential effects  

**Step 5: Implement the Solution or Escalate as Necessary**

**Step 6: Verify Full System Functionality**
- Implement preventive measures (if applicable)  

**Step 7: Document Everything**
- Findings  
- Actions taken  
- Outcomes  
- Lessons learned
