### 🎯 Step 1: Understand the Problem Scope

If your initial questions are accurate, you'll know:
- The **location**, **scope**, and **severity** of the problem
- Whether it’s due to a **recent change** or a **configuration oversight**

---

### 🧪 Step 2: Diagnose Based on Symptoms

- Identify symptoms and match them to likely causes
- Test each cause one at a time until you find the right one
- Be aware: some issues involve **multiple causes** (rare but difficult)

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Methods

A network system is complex. If one method doesn’t find the issue, try another.

**Two common styles:**

- **🔍 Question the Obvious**  
  - Ask: What should be happening?  
  - Look for basic oversights (e.g., unplugged cable)

- **🔁 Prove Each Component Methodically**  
  - Test each part of the system in order  
  - Time-consuming, but reliable for tricky issues

### 🧭 OSI Model Troubleshooting

Use the OSI model as a structured path.  
You can work **top-to-bottom** or **bottom-to-top**, but only move layers once you’ve ruled one out.

#### OSI Layers (1 to 7):

1. **Physical** – Cable, transceiver, media converter, hub  
2. **Data Link** – NIC, MAC address, switch, access point  
3. **Network** – IP address, router, firewall  
4. **Transport**  
5. **Session**  
6. **Presentation**  
7. **Application** – Web, email, file transfer apps, security appliances

### 🧑‍💻 Workstation Troubleshooting Example

1. Is the issue **hardware** or **software**?  
2. Which **hardware subsystem** is affected? (NIC? Cable?)  
3. Is the problem in the **NIC adapter** or the **cabling**?  
4. Test your theory — swap the cable with a known good one

🧠 If the issue becomes obvious at any point, great!  
But if not, be prepared to **go back and revise** your assumptions.

> ⚠️ Multiple components may be broken.  
> Sometimes a good part looks bad because **something else is broken** upstream/downstream.

### ⚔️ Divide and Conquer Approach

Instead of starting at the top or bottom, begin at the layer **most likely** causing the issue.  
Work **up or down** based on what you find.

**Example Flow:**

- Start at **Layer 3 (Network)**  
- If no problem there → check **Layer 4 (Transport)**  
- If Layer 3 has issues → check **Layer 2 (Data Link)** first  
- If Layer 2 is good → return to Layer 3 and test upward

🧭 This is faster than linear OSI testing when you have a good hunch — but still requires logical structure.

---

✅ Always be flexible.  
If your theory doesn’t hold, **retrace your steps** and consider other causes.
