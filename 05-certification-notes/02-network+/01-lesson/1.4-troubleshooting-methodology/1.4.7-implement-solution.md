### 🔧 Execute Your Fix

Your solution might be as simple as:
- Resetting the system to a **baseline config**
- Undoing an **unauthorized change**
- Restarting a **service**
- Plugging in a **cable**

If the fix involves **reverting to a known good configuration**, and you’re authorized, you can **implement directly**.

---

### 🛑 When Implementation Isn’t Simple

If your fix involves a **change to the system or network**, you probably need to follow a **change management plan**.

> ⚠️ You must have **authorization** to make system-level or network-wide changes.

If not:
- Escalate the problem to senior staff
- If the fix impacts others on the network, plan carefully:
  - Pick the right **time** to apply the fix
  - Inform **users** in advance

---

### 📋 Before You Make Any Changes

- Take a **full backup** of both data and config
- **Test** after each individual change
- If the change **doesn’t work**, **revert it**
- Don’t make changes blindly — document every step

> 🚨 Making a bunch of changes without knowing what you did  
> = Turning a minor issue into a major disaster.

---

A proper fix is **controlled**, **documented**, and **reversible**.
