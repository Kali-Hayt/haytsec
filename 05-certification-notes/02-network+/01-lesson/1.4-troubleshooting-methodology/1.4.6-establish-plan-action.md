### 🧭 What Is a Plan of Action?

If you choose **not to escalate**, your next move is to form a **plan of action**.  
This plan outlines the steps you’ll take to solve the issue.

There are usually **three core solutions** to any problem:

---

### 🔧 Repair

- Fix the problem directly
- Evaluate whether the **cost or time** to repair makes it the best choice

---

### ♻️ Replace

- Swap the faulty part with a new or working one
- Often more expensive and slower if parts aren't readily available
- May be a good time to **upgrade** instead of replace like-for-like

> 💡 **Pro Tip:**  
> When testing cables, connectors, or devices — always keep a **known-good spare** on hand.  
> Try substitution testing: plug in the spare and see if the issue resolves.

---

### ✅ Accept

- Some problems are minor or not worth the cost to fix
- If fixing it isn’t cost-effective, **document it** and **move on**
- You may choose to implement a **workaround**

---

### 🧠 Consider the Big Picture

When choosing a solution, factor in:
- The **cost** and **time** needed
- The **ripple effect** on other systems  
  (e.g., a patch fixes one app but breaks another)
- Whether you need **authorization** to make changes

Keep your **configuration management documentation** up to date.  
Follow **SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)** and know who signs off on changes.

---

Your action plan should be **logical**, **approved**, and **based on proven facts** — not assumptions.
