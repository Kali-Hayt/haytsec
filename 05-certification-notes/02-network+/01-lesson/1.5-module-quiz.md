**Question 2**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** A network architect is reviewing a network where application services and resources are centrally provisioned, managed, and secured.  
What is this type of network called?

- ☐ Point to point  
- ✅ Client server  
- ☐ Peer to peer  
- ☐ SOHO  

**Explanation:**  
A **client-server network** centralizes resources and management on a dedicated server, making it ideal for structured, secure environments. Peer-to-peer and SOHO setups are more decentralized or small-scale, and point-to-point doesn't fit the centralized management model.

**Question 3**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** You are setting up a small office network with several computers, a printer, and a network storage device. All devices are connected to a single switch.  
You want to ensure that each device can communicate with the others on the network. To facilitate this communication, you need to consider the type of addressing that is used at the Data Link layer.  
What type of address is used at the Data Link layer to ensure each device can communicate with the others on the same network segment?

- ✅ MAC addresses that are unique to each network interface  
- ☐ Port numbers assigned by the network applications  
- ☐ Hostnames configured by the network administrator  
- ☐ IP addresses assigned by a DHCP server  

**Explanation:**  
The **Data Link layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model uses **MAC addresses** for communication on the same local network. MAC addresses are hard-coded into the network interface and provide device-level identification on LANs.

**Question 4**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following statements are true about Requests for Comments (RFCs)? (Select two.)

- ☐ RFCs are confidential documents only available to government agencies.  
- ✅ Some RFCs are designated informational or experimental.  
- ☐ RFCs are only published by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  
- ✅ An older RFC is never updated; a new RFC is published with a new number if changes are required.  
- ☐ All RFCs are considered official internet standards.  

**Explanation:**  
RFCs are public documents—**not confidential**—and can be proposals, standards, or just informational/experimental. If an RFC needs updating, it’s replaced with a **new RFC with a new number**, not modified. Not all RFCs become standards; many are for documentation or proposals only.

**Question 5**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** To fully solve a problem, what proactive step should be taken?

- ☐ Avoid communicating the solution to the customer.  
- ☐ Ignore any factors that may cause the problem to recur.  
- ☐ Increase the complexity of the system to prevent easy access.  
- ✅ Try to eliminate any factors that may cause the problem to recur.  

**Explanation:**  
Solving the immediate issue isn’t enough—you’ve got to **proactively prevent it from coming back**. That means identifying and eliminating root causes or recurring triggers, not just patching symptoms.

**Question 6**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** A help desk operator is troubleshooting a site that is no longer responsive.  
Which of the following is the last step the operator should perform?

- ☐ Establish plan of action  
- ☐ Determine cause  
- ✅ Document findings  
- ☐ Implement solution  

**Explanation:**  
According to the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology, the final step is to **document everything**—the problem, steps taken, results, and lessons learned. This supports future troubleshooting and knowledge sharing.

**Question 7**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which OSI model layer is responsible for guaranteeing reliable message delivery?

- ☐ Session  
- ☐ Data Link  
- ☐ Application  
- ✅ Transport  

**Explanation:**  
The **Transport layer (Layer 4)** ensures reliable transmission through error correction, acknowledgment, and flow control—especially using protocols like **TCP**. It’s the layer that "keeps its promises" to deliver your data correctly and in order.

---
---

**Question 8**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** When troubleshooting requires a change to the system or the network environment, what is MOST likely to be recommended as a course of action?

- ✅ Following a change management plan  
- ☐ Only making changes outside of business hours without notification  
- ☐ Making all changes at once to save time  
- ☐ Ignoring the standard procedures and making the change immediately  

**Explanation:**  
Change management plans are in place to **minimize risk**, **communicate effectively**, and **document outcomes**. Making unsanctioned changes—especially without notification—is a one-way ticket to chaos, outages, or worse. Always follow the plan.

---

**Question 9**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** When verifying a solution to a reported problem, what is the primary goal?

- ☐ To change the system's configuration settings  
- ☐ To implement additional features unrelated to the problem  
- ☐ To ensure the system functions faster than before  
- ✅ To validate that the solution fixes the reported problem without affecting the system's overall functionality  

**Explanation:**  
Verification is about **precision and stability**—you’re not upgrading, overhauling, or optimizing. You’re confirming the **issue is resolved** and nothing else is broken as a result. Think of it like checking that the patch holds and didn’t tear the rest of the fabric.

**Question 10**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What is the role of an Access Control List (ACL) at Layer 3 (Network layer) of the OSI model?

- ✅ To filter network traffic by permitting or blocking packets based on IP addresses and other criteria  
- ☐ To serve as a list of permissions for file access on the network  
- ☐ To define the maximum size for packets transmitted across the network  
- ☐ To act as a routing protocol for determining the best path for data packets  

**Explanation:**  
At Layer 3, ACLs are like **bouncers at a club**—they check the source and destination IPs and decide who gets in or out. It’s all about controlling traffic based on defined criteria like **IP, protocol, or port**. This is fundamental to **network security and traffic management**.

**Question 11**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** A small office/home office (SOHO) network utilizes a router to connect its local network, using the private IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24, to the Internet.  
When a host within this local network attempts to access a website with a public IP address outside the 192.168.1.0/24 range, what action does the SOHO router take?

- ☐ The router requests additional authentication before allowing access to external IP addresses.  
- ☐ The router assigns a new private IP address to the host to enable Internet access.  
- ☐ The router blocks the request because it is outside the local network range.  
- ✅ The router forwards the packet over its WAN interface to the Internet, directing any replies back to the host on the LAN.  

**Explanation:**  
Routers **use NAT (Network Address Translation)** to forward traffic from private IPs to public networks. When your device (like a laptop on 192.168.1.x) sends a packet to, say, 8.8.8.8, the router rewrites the source IP to its **public IP**, sends it to the internet, and makes sure any responses get routed **back to the correct internal host**. That’s NAT magic at work—**default behavior for SOHO routers**.

**Question 12**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** How are packets forwarded at the Layer 3 (Network layer) of the OSI model?

- ☐ Packets are forwarded from one router to another using signal amplification.  
- ☐ Packets are forwarded based on their physical MAC addresses.  
- ✅ Packets are forwarded based on their destination network address.  
- ☐ Packets are forwarded according to the quality of the service set by the user.  

**Explanation:**  
Layer 3 = **Network Layer**, and this is where **IP addresses** live. Routers at this layer make decisions about where to send packets by looking at the **destination IP address**, *not* MACs (that's Layer 2).  
Think of IP addresses like mailing addresses—Layer 3 routers are your mail carriers. MACs are just apartment numbers.

**Question 13**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which networking component would connect to a SOHO router, operating at the first layer of the OSI model?

- ☐ Wireless Access Point  
- ☐ Firewall  
- ☐ Internal bridge  
- ✅ RJ-45  

**Explanation:**  
Layer 1 of the OSI model is the **Physical Layer** — the land of cables, connectors, and signaling.  
**RJ-45** is the standard connector used for Ethernet — it's pure Layer 1 hardware, transmitting raw bits.  
The other options involve higher-layer logic or wireless signals.

**Question 14**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What is the decimal form of the following binary IP address?  
`11001101.00111001.10101001.01000010`

- ☐ 190.42.154.51  
- ☐ 206.58.170.67  
- ✅ 205.57.169.66  
- ☐ 238.90.202.99  

**Explanation:**  
Convert each 8-bit binary octet to decimal:  
- `11001101` = 205  
- `00111001` = 57  
- `10101001` = 169  
- `01000010` = 66  

Final IP address: **205.57.169.66**

**Question 15**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** Which of the following BEST describes devices that are connected to a network and can send, receive, or process data?

- ☐ Network cables  
- ☐ Network hubs  
- ✅ Network nodes  
- ☐ Network protocols  

**Explanation:**  
A **network node** is any physical device on a network that can send, receive, or process data. This includes computers, servers, printers, switches, etc. Cables and protocols don’t "process" — they enable the connections and rules.

**Question 17**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** A security architect is looking over network topologies where each endpoint node connects to a central forwarding node.  
What is this type of network topology called?

- ☐ Mesh  
- ☐ Client server  
- ☐ Point-to-point  
- ✅ Star  

**Explanation:**  
In a **star topology**, all devices (nodes) are connected to a central device (like a switch or hub). This central point manages forwarding, making it easy to manage but a single point of failure. It’s widely used in modern LANs.

**Question 18**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** When troubleshooting network issues using the CompTIA Network+ troubleshooting methodology, what is the first step to resolving it?

- ✅ Identify the problem.  
- ☐ Establish a theory of probable cause.  
- ☐ Establish a plan of action to resolve.  
- ☐ Test the theory to determine cause.  

**Explanation:**  
The **first step** in CompTIA’s troubleshooting methodology is always to **identify the problem**. This includes gathering information, documenting symptoms, and questioning users. Jumping to solutions without this step often leads to wasted time and misdiagnosis.

**Question 19**  
**✅ Correct**  
**Q:** What mechanism is primarily used to protect wireless hosts connecting to a SOHO network through a SOHO router?

- ☐ MAC address filtering  
- ☐ Port forwarding  
- ✅ Encryption  
- ☐ Quality of Service (QoS) settings  

**Explanation:**  
Encryption is the **primary** defense for wireless communications. Protocols like **WPA2** or **WPA3** encrypt data transmitted between wireless hosts and the router, protecting it from eavesdropping. MAC filtering and port forwarding are secondary, and QoS is for traffic prioritization—not security.
