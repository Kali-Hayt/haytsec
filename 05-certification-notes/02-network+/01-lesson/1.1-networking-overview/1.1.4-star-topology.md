## ‚≠ê 1.1.4 Star Topology

- Each **endpoint node** connects to a **central forwarding device** (switch/router).
- Central node **mediates all communication** between devices.
- Most **common physical topology** in use today.

### üîß How It Works:
- All data flows **through a single device** (like a switch/router).
- Common in SOHO setups: clients connect via **Wi-Fi or Ethernet** to one central router.
- **Easy to manage** ‚Äî central point can **monitor**, **control**, and **troubleshoot**.

### ‚úÖ Pros:
- **Simple to reconfigure**
- **Easy fault isolation** ‚Äî if a device/cable fails, it only affects that one connection.
- **Centralized management** (switch/router/WAP)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:
- If the **central device fails**, the **whole network goes down**.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Related Topology: Hub-and-Spoke
- **Physically similar to star**, but used for **WANs** instead of LANs.
- Central "hub" connects remote sites ("spokes").

### üß† Real-World Example:
- Home Wi-Fi network where all devices connect to one wireless router.
