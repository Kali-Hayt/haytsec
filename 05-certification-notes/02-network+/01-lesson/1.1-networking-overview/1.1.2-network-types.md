**Network Type = Size + Scope**  
**Size = number of nodes**  
**Scope = physical/geographic reach**

**LAN (Local Area Network):**

- Confined to one location (owned/managed by one org)
- Devices connect via cable or short-range wireless
    
**Types:**
- **Home/Residential** – Router + computers/devices
- **SOHO (Small Office/Home Office)** – May include centralized server
- **SME (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise)** – Dozens of users, structured cabling, routers
- **Enterprise LAN** – Hundreds/thousands of clients + servers
- **Datacenter** – Only servers + storage (no end users)

**WAN (Wide Area Network):**
- Connects networks across long distances
- Used to link office sites, remote users, or datacenters
- Often relies on leased infrastructure (managed by ISPs)
- Commonly uses public networks like the Internet

## Explanation for Above

### 💼 "Leased Infrastructure" Means:

You're **renting access** to someone else’s physical network gear — stuff like fiber optics, copper lines, switches, routers, etc.

### 👇 Who are these infrastructure providers (ISPs)?

Here are some real-world examples in the U.S. and globally:
- **AT&T** – Fiber and DSL lines
- **Comcast/Xfinity** – Coaxial and fiber
- **Verizon** – Fiber (FiOS) and wireless backbone
- **Spectrum (Charter)** – Hybrid coax/fiber
- **Lumen Technologies (CenturyLink)** – Huge backbone provider
- **Cogent, Zayo, Level 3** – Backbone fiber providers (often wholesale B2B)
- **Google Fiber** – Limited areas, but ultra-fast infrastructure
- **BT Group (UK)**, **Deutsche Telekom (Germany)**, **NTT (Japan)** – big overseas players

# LAN vs WAN

### 🌐 LAN vs WAN

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**  
  - Connects **local hosts** (PCs, servers, printers)  
  - **Confined to a small area** (home, office, campus)  
  - **Privately owned & managed**  
  - Example: Home network with router, computer, printer

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**  
  - Connects **multiple LANs** across large distances  
  - Uses **routers** to link networks together  
  - Often relies on **ISP or leased public infrastructure**  
  - Example: Corporate networks connected via VPN or Internet

| **Term** | **Scope** | **Ownership** | **Examples** |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| **LAN** | Local (room/building) | Private | Home Wi-Fi, Office Ethernet |
| **WAN** | Global (cities/countries) | Public/Shared | Internet, Corporate WAN |

- ✅ **Summary**: LAN = one small network; WAN = many networks linked via routers
