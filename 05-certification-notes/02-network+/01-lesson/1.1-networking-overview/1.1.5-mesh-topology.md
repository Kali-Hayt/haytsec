## 🔗 1.1.5 Mesh Topology
- Common in **WANs** and the **Internet**
- **Full Mesh**: every device has a point-to-point link to every other  
  - Formula: `n(n–1)/2` links  
  - Example: 4 nodes = 6 links | 40 nodes = 780 links  
  - Rare in practice — too expensive & complex
- **Partial Mesh**: only key nodes interconnected  
  - Adds **redundancy** without full complexity  
  - Most common real-world implementation
- ✅ **Pros**: Very fault-tolerant, multiple alternate paths  
- ⚠️ **Cons**: High cost (in full mesh), difficult to scale

# Explanation

### 📈 Mesh Link Formula Explained – `n(n−1)/2`

- **Goal:** Calculate how many **direct links** are needed for **full mesh** (every device connects to every other)

#### 🔢 Example: 4 Devices (A, B, C, D)
- A → B, C, D = **3 links**
- B → C, D (A already counted) = **2 links**
- C → D (A, B already counted) = **1 link**
- D = Already connected = **0 links**
- ✅ **Total Links = 6**

#### 🧠 Apply the Formula
- `n(n−1)/2 = 4(4−1)/2 = 12/2 = 6`

#### 💡 Why Divide by 2?
- Each link is **shared betw**

# Explanation- Partial and Full Mesh
## 🕸️ Full Mesh vs Partial Mesh

- **Full Mesh**
  - Every node has a direct link to every other node  
  - Requires `n(n–1)/2` links  
  - ✅ Max redundancy & fault tolerance  
  - ⚠️ Expensive & hard to scale

- **Partial Mesh**
  - Only critical nodes are fully connected  
  - Other nodes connect selectively  
  - ✅ More practical & cost-effective  
  - ❌ Less redundant than full mesh
