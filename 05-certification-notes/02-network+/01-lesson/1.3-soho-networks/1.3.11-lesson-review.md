**Question 1**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** What is the decimal form of the following binary IP address?  
`11001101.00111001.10101001.01000010`  
- ☐ 190.42.154.51  
- ☐ 206.58.170.67  
- ✅ 205.57.169.66  
- ☐ 238.90.202.99  
**Explanation:** Each octet is 8 bits. Multiply each bit by its positional value (2ⁿ), then sum. Binary math uses:  
128 (2⁷), 64 (2⁶), 32 (2⁵), 16 (2⁴), 8 (2³), 4 (2²), 2 (2¹), 1 (2⁰)

**Octet 1: `11001101`**
(1×128) + (1×64) + (0×32) + (0×16) + (1×8) + (1×4) + (0×2) + (1×1)  
= 128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = **205**

**Octet 2: `00111001`**
(0×128) + (0×64) + (1×32) + (1×16) + (1×8) + (0×4) + (0×2) + (1×1)  
= 0 + 0 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = **57**

**Octet 3: `10101001`**
(1×128) + (0×64) + (1×32) + (0×16) + (1×8) + (0×4) + (0×2) + (1×1)  
= 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = **169**

**Octet 4: `01000010`**
(0×128) + (1×64) + (0×32) + (0×16) + (0×8) + (0×4) + (1×2) + (0×1)  
= 0 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = **66**

**Final IP Address:** **205.57.169.66**

**Question 2**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** What is the MOST effective method for protecting the management interface of a SOHO router?  
- ✅ Configuring a strong administrative account passphrase  
- ☐ Enabling UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)  
- ☐ Disabling the firewall  
- ☐ Setting the router to automatically accept firmware updates  
**Explanation:** A strong admin passphrase directly prevents unauthorized access to the router's interface. Other options may help system security, but they don’t secure the login itself.

---
**Question 3**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** Which of the following interfaces does a SOHO router provide at the Physical Layer of the OSI model? (Select three.)  
- ☐ HDMI ports for multimedia streaming  
- ✅ Radio antennas for wireless signal transmission  
- ☐ VGA ports for video output  
- ☐ USB ports for direct computer connection  
- ☐ SATA ports for internal storage connection  
- ✅ WAN port for Internet Service Provider (ISP) connection  
- ✅ RJ-45 ports for a local cabled network  
**Explanation:** The Physical Layer deals with hardware interfaces and signal transmission. SOHO routers commonly include **radio antennas** (for wireless), **WAN ports** (to connect to ISP modems), and **RJ-45 ports** (for Ethernet LAN). HDMI, VGA, and SATA are not used for networking.

---
**Question 4**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** Which of the following sets correctly represents the possible values that can be represented by each digit in hexadecimal notation?  
- ☐ 1 through 10  
- ✅ 0 through 9 and A through F  
- ☐ 0 through 9 and A through E  
- ☐ 0 through 7  
**Explanation:** Hexadecimal (base-16) uses 16 symbols: **0–9** (for values 0–9) and **A–F** (for values 10–15). It's commonly used in MAC addresses, memory locations, and color codes. "0–7" is octal, not hex.

---
**Question 5**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** Which of the following BEST describes a demarcation point in the context of telecommunications?  
- ✅ The point at which the telco's cabling enters the customer premises  
- ☐ The maximum data transfer rate achievable by the ISP  
- ☐ The protocol used for encrypting data over the Internet  
- ☐ The central hub where all ISPs connect and exchange data  
**Explanation:** The demarcation point (demarc) is the physical boundary where the service provider's responsibility ends and the customer's begins—typically where the ISP’s cabling enters the building.

---
**Question 6**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** What do Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use to establish links between their networks within an Internet eXchange Point (IXP) data center?  
- ☐ NFC (Near Field Communication)  
- ☐ Bluetooth connectivity  
- ✅ Transit and peering arrangements  
- ☐ Peer-to-peer file sharing  
**Explanation:** ISPs connect and route traffic through Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) using **transit** (paid connections) and **peering** (mutual agreements). NFC, Bluetooth, and P2P are unrelated to backbone-level ISP infrastructure.

**Question 7**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** A freelance photographer is setting up a home office. They need to connect a desktop, a laptop, a network printer, and occasionally, guests' devices to the Internet and to each other for file sharing and printing.  
Which type of network is MOST suitable for this scenario?  
- ☐ PAN (Personal Area Network)  
- ✅ SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) Network  
- ☐ CAN (Campus Area Network)  
- ☐ MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)  
**Explanation:** A SOHO network is designed for small environments like home offices. It supports multiple connected devices with shared Internet access, file sharing, and printing—ideal for freelance or home-based professionals.

---
**Question 8**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** A small office/home office (SOHO) network is configured to use the private IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24.  
If you are setting up a SOHO router for this network, which of the following IP addresses would be the MOST appropriate for the router?  
- ☐ 192.168.1.255  
- ✅ 192.168.1.1  
- ☐ 192.168.2.1  
- ☐ 203.0.113.1  
**Explanation:** In a /24 subnet (255.255.255.0), the first usable IP is typically assigned to the default gateway—**192.168.1.1** is standard for a SOHO router.  
- **192.168.1.255** is the broadcast address.  
- **192.168.2.1** is outside the 192.168.1.0/24 range.  
- **203.0.113.1** is a public IP, not private.
---
**Question 9**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** At layer 4 of the OSI model, how is each application identified to facilitate proper routing and delivery of data?  
- ☐ By the MAC address of the destination device  
- ✅ By a unique port number assigned to the application  
- ☐ Through the application's unique username and password  
- ☐ Through the use of encryption algorithms  
**Explanation:** Layer 4 (Transport Layer) uses **port numbers** to distinguish between different services and applications on the same device.  
Examples: Port 80 for HTTP, Port 443 for HTTPS, Port 22 for SSH.  
MAC addresses belong to Layer 2, and usernames/encryption belong higher up.

---
**Question 10**
**✅ Correct**
**Q:** Which of the following functions does a SOHO router implement at layer 2 to make use of its Physical layer adapters? (Select two.)  
- ☐ Firewall  
- ✅ Ethernet switch  
- ☐ DHCP server  
- ☐ Network Address Translation (NAT)  
- ✅ Wireless access point  
**Explanation:** Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) handles MAC addressing and local network switching.  
- **Ethernet switch** functions at Layer 2 to direct traffic between local devices.  
- **Wireless access points** also operate at Layer 2, using MAC addresses to connect wireless clients.  
Firewall, DHCP, and NAT are Layer 3 or higher.
