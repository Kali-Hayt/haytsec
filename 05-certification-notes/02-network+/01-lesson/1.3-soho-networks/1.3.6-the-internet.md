## 📘 1.3.6 – The Internet
- **WAN Role:** Connects SOHO network to the Internet via router's WAN port

### 🌐 Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
- **Legacy & Modern:** DSL, cable, fiber, cellular, satellite; some legacy systems still use PSTN
- **CPE (Customer Premises Equipment):** On-site hardware like routers/modems
- **Ownership:** CPE may be owned by customer or leased from telco
- **Local Loop:** Telco cabling from customer to exchange
- **Demarcation Point:** Where telco wiring enters customer site (often shortened to *demarc*)

### 🏢 Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- **Core Infrastructure:** High-bandwidth trunks connect via IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)
- **Transit & Peering:** ISPs make agreements to route traffic
- **Tiered Hierarchy:** Reflects dependency on other ISPs

### 📏 Internet Standards Bodies
- **IANA (iana.org):** Manages IP address allocation & top-level domain space (run by ICANN)
- **IETF (ietf.org):** Develops Internet standards via RFCs (Requests for Comments)
  - RFCs may define protocols, policies, or experiments
  - Old RFCs not updated; new RFCs are published instead
  - Official repo: [rfc-editor.org](https://www.rfc-editor.org)

### 🔁 OSI vs. Internet Model (RFC 1122)
- **OSI Model:** 7-layer model with distinct Session, Presentation, and Application layers
- **Internet (TCP/IP) Model:**
  - **Link Layer:** OSI Layers 1-2
  - **Internet Layer:** OSI Layer 3
  - **Transport Layer:** OSI Layers 4-5
  - **Application Layer:** OSI Layers 6-7
