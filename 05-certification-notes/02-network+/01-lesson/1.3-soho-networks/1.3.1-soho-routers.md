## 📡 1.3.1 – SOHO Routers

**📘 Key Concepts:**
- **LAN (Local Area Network):**  
  A network in a single location (e.g., home, office). Can range from a couple devices to enterprise-level with thousands of nodes.

- **SOHO (Small Office/Home Office):**  
  A **subcategory of LAN** with a small number of hosts. Typically uses a **single integrated device** (SOHO router) to provide:
  - Local network connectivity
  - Internet access

- **WAN (Wide Area Network):**  
  Networks that span large geographical areas (e.g., the Internet). A SOHO router connects the LAN to the WAN.

- **SOHO Router Role:**  
  Often described as an **intermediate system** forwarding traffic between LAN ↔ WAN.  
  ⚠️ Routing is only one of its jobs—we’ll analyze others using the **OSI model**.

### Definition:

> **A SOHO router is a single device that enables a Local Area Network (LAN) to access the Internet by routing traffic through a Wide Area Network (WAN) connection provided by an ISP.**

## 🏠 What is a SOHO Router?

> A **SOHO router** is a single integrated device that enables a **Local Area Network (LAN)** to access the **Internet** by routing traffic through a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** connection provided by an ISP.

**Key Functions:**
- Creates and manages the LAN (wired and wireless)
- Routes LAN traffic to/from the Internet
- Provides:
  - DHCP (IP assignment)
  - NAT (translates private IPs to public)
  - Firewall (basic packet filtering)
  - DNS forwarding (resolves domain names)
  - Wireless Access Point (Wi-Fi)
- Connects to ISP via the WAN port
