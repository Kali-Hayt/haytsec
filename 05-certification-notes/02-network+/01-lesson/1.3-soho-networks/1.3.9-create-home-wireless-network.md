# 🧪 Lab: Create a Home Wireless Network

## 🧠 Scenario:
You’re working on a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) network. The homeowner changed ISPs. They have an Ethernet router connected to an RJ45 wall jack. Your job is to wirelessly connect the laptop using a new wireless access point.

  - Supports **up to 600 Mbps**
  - Supports **2.4 GHz** wireless standards

- **🔌 Power the wireless access point**
  - Plug into wall outlet

- **🌐 Connect the WAP to the router**
  - Use Ethernet cable → RJ45 wall port
