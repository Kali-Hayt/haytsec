## 1.3.5 Transport and Application Layer and Security Functions

There is no separate OSI model layer for security. Instead, security issues can arise, and solutions are needed at every layer. Network security is essentially a matter of allowing or preventing devices, users, and services (applications) from using the network. The WAN interface is the network perimeter. The SOHO router can apply filtering rules to traffic sent between the public and private zones, implementing a firewall. The firewall can be configured to block traffic based on source or destination IP addresses and also on the type of application.

At layer 4, each application is identified by a port number, such as **80** for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) web traffic or **25** for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email traffic.

The firewall in the router can be configured with rules specifying behavior for each port. For example, computers on the network might use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to share files. It would not be appropriate for hosts on the Internet to be able to access these shared files, so the SMB port would be blocked by default on the WAN interface but allowed on the LAN and WLAN interfaces.

Any host can connect to the RJ45 ports on the router and join
