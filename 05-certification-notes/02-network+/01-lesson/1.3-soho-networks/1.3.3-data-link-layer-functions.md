## 1.3.3 â€“ Data Link Layer Functions
- **OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)**: Responsible for local communication between devices on the same network
- **SOHO Router Layer 2 Roles:**
  - **Ethernet switch**: Internally connects all RJ45 LAN ports together
    - Forwards frames based on **MAC addresses**
  - **Wireless access point**: Implements Wi-Fi standard
    - Acts like a hub for wireless devices (laptops, phones, tablets, printers)
    - Internally connected to the same switchâ€”**bridges wired and wireless**
    - Forms a single Layer 2 network segment

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Devices on LAN (wired) and Wi-Fi (wireless) are part of the **same logical Layer 2 broadcast domain**
- All network interfaces (wired or wireless) have a **unique MAC address**
- MAC addresses are used for **frame-level communication and forwarding decisions**

## ðŸ“ˆ Diagram Breakdown
- **LAN ports** connect directly to the built-in switch
- **Wi-Fi AP** is internally wired to that switch
- **All clients (wired and wireless)** communicate within a single Layer 2 network

## ðŸ’¡ Summary
- Layer 2 = MAC-based forwarding
- Layer 1 = hardware interfaces (cables, radios, ports)
- SOHO router blends both seamlessly to connect internal hosts
