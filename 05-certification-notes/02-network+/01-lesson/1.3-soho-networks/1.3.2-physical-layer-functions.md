## 1.3.2 â€“ Physical Layer Functions
- **Layer 1 (Physical)**: Concerned with transmitting raw bits via physical hardware
- **SOHO Router Interfaces:**
  - **RJ45 LAN Ports**: Typically 4 ports used for internal wired devices (PCs, printers, etc.)
  - **Radio Antennas**: Send/receive wireless signals (Wi-Fi); part of physical transmission medium
  - **WAN Port**: Connects router to ISPâ€™s network (Internet)
    - Often another RJ45 port (Ethernet to modem/fiber)
    - May use RJ11 (DSL line) or coax (cable service)
- **Purpose of Each Port:**
  - **LAN = Local Network Access** (trusted internal traffic)
  - **WAN = External Internet Access** (untrusted, public side)

## ðŸ§  Analogy
- **LAN ports** = gates **inside** your network (castle walls)
- **WAN port** = **drawbridge** to the outside world (internet)

## ðŸ”Œ Diagram Reference
- LAN = 4 grouped RJ45 ports for local hosts
- WAN = Separate port connected to ISP modem
- Antennas = Wireless transmission interface (still physical layer)
