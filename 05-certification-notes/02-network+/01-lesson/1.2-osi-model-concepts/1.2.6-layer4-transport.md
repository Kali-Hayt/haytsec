## 🧱 Layer 4 - Transport

![[Pasted image 20250704212535.png]]
- The first three layers of the OSI model focus on moving data (frames, datagrams) between devices.
- The **Transport Layer** (Layer 4) is the "end-to-end" layer — it ensures the actual **content** is delivered properly.
- It identifies **which application** on the device the data belongs to using **port numbers**:
  - Example: **Port 80** = HTTP (web), **Port 25** = Email (SMTP)

### 🔁 On the Sending Host:
- Packages data from upper layers into **segments**
- Tags each segment with a **port number**
- Passes it down to Layer 3 (Network) for delivery
- Multiple apps (web, email, etc.) can send data at once — this is called **multiplexing**

### 🧭 On the Network:
- Routers and switches ignore port numbers — they only use IP (Layer 3) and MAC (Layer 2)
- Port numbers are **payload only** at this point

### 🛬 On the Receiving Host:
- Port number is **read again** after de-encapsulation
- System knows what app the data belongs to — this is **de-multiplexing**

### ✅ Reliability:
- Transport Layer can provide **reliable delivery** (TCP):
  - Resends lost packets
  - Ensures correct order

### ⚙️ Devices at this Layer:
- **Multilayer Switches** (load balancers)
- Advanced **Firewalls**
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
