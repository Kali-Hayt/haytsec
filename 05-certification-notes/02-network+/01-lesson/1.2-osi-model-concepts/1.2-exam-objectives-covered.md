## 📚 Lesson 1.2 – OSI Model Concepts

### 📝 **Exam Objective Covered**
**1.1** Explain concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model.

### 🧠 **Lesson Summary**
- Networks rely on standardized models to describe how devices and protocols interconnect.
- This lesson focuses on the **OSI model**, a key reference framework that breaks data communication into **7 discrete layers**.
- Understanding the OSI layers helps you identify where devices and protocols operate so you can **implement, manage, and troubleshoot** networks more effectively.

### 🔍 Key Questions to Answer:
- **Why are protocols important for networking?**
- **What is the OSI model? Why is it important for understanding networking?**
- **At which OSI layer do common network appliances, applications, and functions operate?**
- **How does data encapsulation work?**
  - How does it relate to **frames, datagrams, segments, and ports**?
