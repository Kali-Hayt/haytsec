### **1.2.5 Layer 3 - Network**

- **Purpose:** Responsible for moving data between networks — also called an **internetwork**.
- **Uses logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses)** to route packets between segments.
- **Difference from Layer 2:** Layer 2 works within a single segment using hardware addresses. Layer 3 forwards data **between different segments** using **logical addresses**.

#### **Key Concepts:**
- **Segment**: A logical grouping of hosts on the same network.
- **Routing**: Moves packets from one network to another using routers.
- **Networks are heterogeneous** (can use different hardware/media) but connected by routers.

#### **Example Scenario:**  
1. Host `1.2` wants to send data to Host `2.3`.  
2. Router A forwards the packet to Router B through **Network 9**.  
3. Router B sees Network 2 is directly connected and forwards to Host `2.3`.

#### **Devices at Layer 3:**
- **Router** – Connects multiple Layer 2 networks and determines the best path for packets.
- **Firewall (basic)** – Can operate at Layer 3 to filter traffic using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.

#### **Terminology:**
- **Packets / Datagrams** – The name for data units at Layer 3.
- **Access Control List (ACL)** – A set of rules controlling which traffic is allowed or denied.
