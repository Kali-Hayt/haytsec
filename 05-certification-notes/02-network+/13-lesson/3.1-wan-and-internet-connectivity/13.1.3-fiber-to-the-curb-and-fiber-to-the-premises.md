## 13.1.3 ‚Äì Fiber to the Curb (FTTC) & Fiber to the Premises (FTTP)

### The Bandwidth Problem
- The main challenge for WAN speeds near LAN performance: **‚Äúlast mile‚Äù bottleneck**.
- Copper wiring in the last mile often limits performance.
- **FTTx** = ‚ÄúFiber to the X‚Äù umbrella term for projects replacing copper with fiber optic links.

### üß± Fiber to the Curb (FTTC) & VDSL
- Fiber runs to a **communications cabinet** near homes/businesses.
- Last segment to premises uses **copper** wiring.
- Often paired with **VDSL (Very High-Speed DSL)**.
  - Higher speeds than other DSL types but **shorter range**.
  - Supports **symmetric** (equal up/down) & **asymmetric** modes.
- **Performance**:
  - Over 300 m (1,000 ft):
    - Asymmetric ‚Üí ~52 Mbps down / 6 Mbps up.
    - Symmetric ‚Üí ~26 Mbps both ways.
  - **VDSL2** (short range ~100 m / 300 ft) ‚Üí up to **100 Mbps** bidirectional.
- **Important**: Modem type must match service (ADSL-only modem ‚â† VDSL capable).

**Analogy**:  
FTTC is like having a high-speed expressway run close to your street, but the final block is still a slower, narrower road.

### üß± Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) & Optical Network Terminals (ONT)
- Full fiber runs **all the way** to the building.
- Uses a **Passive Optical Network (PON)**:
  - One fiber from **Point of Presence (PoP)** ‚Üí **Optical Line Terminal (OLT)**.
  - Splitters send signal to multiple customers.
- At the premises:
  - Fiber connects to **Optical Network Terminal (ONT)**.
  - ONT converts optical ‚Üí electrical signal.
  - ONT connects to router via **RJ45 Ethernet**.

**Analogy**:  
FTTP is like having a direct water pipeline from the treatment plant to your tap ‚Äî no old pipes slowing the flow.

## Key Difference
- **FTTC**: Fiber most of the way, copper last segment ‚Üí slightly slower, cheaper to deploy.
- **FTTP**: Fiber end-to-end ‚Üí maximum speed, best for future scaling.
