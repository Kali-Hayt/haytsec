# QUESTION 1
What is the purpose of a filter (splitter) in a DSL setup?

❌ To serve as a backup connection point  
❌ To convert digital signals to analog  
✅ To prevent noise from affecting voice calls  
❌ To increase internet speed  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To serve as a backup connection point** → Splitters don’t act as backups; they separate frequencies for voice/data.
- ❌ **To convert digital signals to analog** → That’s the job of a modem, not a splitter.
- ❌ **To increase internet speed** → Splitters don’t boost speed; they prevent interference so the connection remains stable.

# QUESTION 2
At which layer of the OSI model do WANs often use simpler protocols compared to LANs?

✅ Data Link layer  
❌ Physical layer  
❌ Transport layer  
❌ Network layer  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Physical layer** → Deals with the medium, connectors, and signal modulation; protocol complexity is not the focus here.
- ❌ **Transport layer** → Handles end-to-end delivery (TCP/UDP); WAN vs LAN doesn’t significantly change transport complexity.
- ❌ **Network layer** → Handles addressing/routing; WANs and LANs both use complex addressing like IPv4/IPv6 here.

# QUESTION 3
Why do organizations often choose to use public networks for their WAN services?

✅ Because the cost is far less than implementing a private solution  
❌ Because public networks offer the highest security  
❌ Because public networks are faster than private networks  
❌ Because public networks do not require any infrastructure  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Because public networks offer the highest security** → Public networks are less secure by nature; security must be added through encryption/VPNs.
- ❌ **Because public networks are faster than private networks** → Private networks can be faster since they’re dedicated and not shared.
- ❌ **Because public networks do not require any infrastructure** → They still require physical infrastructure from the provider and customer premises equipment.

# QUESTION 4
What is the primary function of a T-carrier system?

❌ To provide wireless connectivity  
❌ To encrypt data transmissions  
✅ To enable voice traffic digitization  
❌ To serve as a backup system for internet connections  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To provide wireless connectivity** → T-carrier is a wired digital transmission system, not wireless.
- ❌ **To encrypt data transmissions** → Encryption is not an inherent function of T-carrier; it’s about transmission, not security.
- ❌ **To serve as a backup system for internet connections** → T-carrier can be used as a primary or backup line, but that’s not its core function.

# QUESTION 5
What technology do service providers use to support FTTC?

✅ VDSL  
❌ WiMAX  
❌ LTE  
❌ ADSL  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **WiMAX** → Wireless broadband standard, not typically used in FTTC deployments.
- ❌ **LTE** → Mobile/cellular technology, unrelated to fixed fiber-to-the-curb services.
- ❌ **ADSL** → Slower DSL technology; FTTC typically uses faster VDSL to take advantage of the short copper run.

# QUESTION 6
How is the ONT connected to the customer's router in FTTP?

❌ Using a USB cable  
✅ Using an RJ45 Ethernet patch cord  
❌ Using a coaxial cable  
❌ Using a fiber optic cable  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Using a USB cable** → USB is not used for this connection in FTTP; Ethernet is the standard.
- ❌ **Using a coaxial cable** → Coax is used in cable broadband, not fiber-to-the-premises.
- ❌ **Using a fiber optic cable** → The fiber terminates at the ONT; from there, the signal is converted to electrical and sent via Ethernet.

# QUESTION 7
What is the very short range rate of VDSL2?

❌ 100 Mbps downstream only  
✅ 100 Mbps bi-directional  
❌ 50 Mbps bi-directional  
❌ 52 Mbps upstream only  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **100 Mbps downstream only** → VDSL2 at very short range supports equal upstream and downstream speeds.
- ❌ **50 Mbps bi-directional** → This is lower than VDSL2’s short-range capability.
- ❌ **52 Mbps upstream only** → The 52 Mbps figure applies to asymmetric VDSL at longer ranges, not VDSL2 at short range.

# QUESTION 8
What role does a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) play in a cable internet setup?

❌ It converts analog signals to digital.  
✅ It routes data traffic via the fiber backbone.  
❌ It serves as a backup connection point.  
❌ It encrypts data transmissions.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It converts analog signals to digital** → Cable internet is already digital over DOCSIS; conversion isn’t the CMTS’s primary role.
- ❌ **It serves as a backup connection point** → CMTS is an active part of the network, not a standby system.
- ❌ **It encrypts data transmissions** → Encryption may be part of other network layers or protocols, but CMTS’s core job is routing data between coax customers and the provider’s fiber backbone.

# QUESTION 9
What is the primary advantage of using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) in T-carrier systems?

❌ It reduces the cost of internet services.  
✅ It enables the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals over a single transmission path.  
❌ It encrypts data for secure transmission.  
❌ It converts analog signals to digital signals.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It reduces the cost of internet services** → Cost savings may occur, but the key feature is efficient use of a single path for multiple signals.
- ❌ **It encrypts data for secure transmission** → TDM does not provide encryption; it’s a multiplexing technique, not a security measure.
- ❌ **It converts analog signals to digital signals** → Digitization is separate from multiplexing; TDM works after data is already in digital form.

# QUESTION 10
What is the function of a Customer Edge (CE) router in a WAN?

❌ To provide firewall services exclusively  
❌ To modulate and demodulate signals  
✅ To connect the customer's network to the provider's network  
❌ To increase the bandwidth of the WAN  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To provide firewall services exclusively** → While a CE router may include firewall features, that is not its primary WAN role.
- ❌ **To modulate and demodulate signals** → That’s the job of a modem, not a CE router.
- ❌ **To increase the bandwidth of the WAN** → The CE router doesn’t change bandwidth; it’s an interconnection point between customer and provider.
