## 13.1.1 ‚Äì Wide Area Networks (WAN) and the OSI Model

### What is a WAN?
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** = Connects devices over *large geographic distances* ‚Äî much larger than a LAN.
- **Enterprise WAN** ‚Üí A WAN used & controlled by a single organization.
- Even if an enterprise *controls* the WAN, it rarely *owns* all the infrastructure.
- Most long-distance communications use **public networks** owned by telecom companies.

### Why use public networks?
- **Cost**: Much cheaper than building a private network.
- **Access rights**: Service providers have legal rights to access certain locations (e.g., utility right-of-way).

## WAN and the OSI Model

### üß± Physical Layer
- Defines **media type** & **interface specifications**.
- WAN links often use **modems** (instead of switches) to connect to provider lines.
- **Modulation** ‚Üí Converting data into signals for transmission.
  - *Analog/Dial-up*: Digital ‚Üí Analog over voice lines (low bandwidth, up to 56 Kbps).
  - *Digital Modems*: Digital signals (Ethernet frames) ‚Üí Suitable for WAN transmission.
- Examples of digital modem types:
  - DSU (Data Service Unit) ‚Äì leased lines
  - DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) modem
  - Cable modem
  - Satellite modem

**Analogy**:  
Think of modulation like turning text into Morse code so it can travel over a telegraph ‚Äî different formats for different ‚Äúwires.‚Äù

### üß± Data Link Layer
- Often uses **simpler protocols** than Ethernet LANs.
- WAN links are often **point-to-point** ‚Üí Less complexity needed.
- Ethernet is now more common for **end-to-end WAN connectivity**.

**Analogy**:  
LAN Data Link is like a busy city street grid; WAN Data Link can be more like a single bridge between two towns.

---

### üß± Network Layer
- Uses **IP (Internet Protocol)** to address customer and provider sites.
- **Customer Edge (CE) router** ‚Üí Connects to **Provider Edge (PE)** via the Link layer.
- Provider assigns **public IPv4/IPv6 addresses** to customers.

**Analogy**:  
This is like having your home‚Äôs mailing address assigned by the city‚Äôs post office so mail can reach you from anywhere.

## Key Takeaways
- WANs extend over much larger distances than LANs.
- Most enterprises rely on telecom-owned infrastructure.
- Modems play a key role in WAN‚Äôs Physical Layer, converting data formats for transmission.
- Data Link in WANs can be simpler, but Ethernet is taking over.
- Network Layer handles addressing so data knows where to go globally.
