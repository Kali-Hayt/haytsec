# QUESTION 1
Which protocol is typically used for remote configuration of network appliances?

❌ SNMP  
❌ FTP  
✅ SSH  
❌ HTTP  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **SNMP** – Used for monitoring and managing network devices, not typically for direct configuration.  
- ❌ **FTP** – Transfers files; not used for secure remote configuration.  
- ❌ **HTTP** – Can be used for web-based admin interfaces, but it’s less secure than SSH and not the standard for command-line configuration.

# QUESTION 2
What is a limitation of using virtual out-of-band management with VLANs?

✅ It may still be compromised by a system-wide network failure.  
❌ It does not support remote management.  
❌ It can be implemented without any cost.  
❌ It provides physical separation of management traffic.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It does not support remote management** – VLAN-based management still supports remote management; that’s one of its purposes.  
- ❌ **It can be implemented without any cost** – Implementation may require hardware, configuration time, and possibly licensing costs.  
- ❌ **It provides physical separation of management traffic** – VLANs offer *logical* separation, not physical. Physical separation is achieved with a dedicated management network.

# QUESTION 3
Why is Telnet considered to be insecure?

✅ It transmits data in plain text.  
❌ It uses strong encryption for all communications.  
❌ It automatically blocks access to port 23.  
❌ It can only transmit text, not binary files.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It uses strong encryption for all communications** – This is the opposite of reality; Telnet has *no* encryption, which is why it’s insecure.  
- ❌ **It automatically blocks access to port 23** – Telnet uses port 23 by default and does not block it.  
- ❌ **It can only transmit text, not binary files** – Telnet can transmit binary data if needed, but its insecurity is unrelated to file type.

# QUESTION 4
What is an SSH host key used for?

✅ Identifying the SSH server  
❌ Storing user passwords securely  
❌ Speeding up the SSH connection process  
❌ Encrypting all data sent over the network  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Storing user passwords securely** – SSH host keys are not for storing credentials; they’re for verifying the server’s identity.  
- ❌ **Speeding up the SSH connection process** – The host key doesn’t make the connection faster; it ensures trust.  
- ❌ **Encrypting all data sent over the network** – While SSH does encrypt data, that’s handled by session keys, not the host key.

# QUESTION 5
What is the benefit of using automation and orchestration in the context of a jump box?

✅ To configure appliances via scripts efficiently  
❌ To manually configure appliances  
❌ To eliminate the need for a firewall  
❌ To reduce the need for secure connections  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To manually configure appliances** – This defeats the purpose of automation, which removes the need for repetitive manual work.  
- ❌ **To eliminate the need for a firewall** – Automation doesn’t replace security devices like firewalls; it just manages configurations more efficiently.  
- ❌ **To reduce the need for secure connections** – Secure connections are still required; automation simply speeds up and standardizes the process.

# QUESTION 6
What is the role of an ACL in the context of a jump box?

✅ To list permissions for resource access  
❌ To encrypt data transmissions  
❌ To determine the bandwidth allocation  
❌ To monitor network traffic  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To encrypt data transmissions** – Encryption is handled by protocols like SSH or TLS, not by ACLs.  
- ❌ **To determine the bandwidth allocation** – Bandwidth control is managed by QoS (Quality of Service), not ACLs.  
- ❌ **To monitor network traffic** – Monitoring is the job of IDS/IPS or logging tools; ACLs are about allowing or denying access.

# QUESTION 7
You are in the middle of a big project at work. All of your work files are on a server at the office. You want to be able to access the server desktop, open and edit files, save the files on the server, and print files to a printer that's connected to a computer at home.

Which protocol should you use?

❌ FTP  
❌ Telnet  
❌ SSH  
✅ RDP  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **FTP** – Only transfers files; it doesn’t give you desktop access or printing capability.  
- ❌ **Telnet** – Unsecure, text-based remote terminal; no GUI access or file printing features.  
- ❌ **SSH** – Secure shell for command-line remote access, not for full desktop interaction.  
---
# QUESTION 8
What does Network Level Authentication (NLA) protect the RDP server against?

✅ Denial of service attacks  
❌ Phishing attacks  
❌ On-path attacks  
❌ SQL injection attacks  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Phishing attacks** – NLA does not prevent tricking users into revealing credentials; phishing is a social engineering issue.  
- ❌ **On-path attacks** – These involve intercepting and altering traffic, which NLA does not specifically mitigate.  
- ❌ **SQL injection attacks** – This is a web/database vulnerability, unrelated to RDP authentication.

# QUESTION 9
How can a developer add a firewall rule via an API?

✅ By creating a JSON formatted request and posting it to the API endpoint  
❌ By sending an email request to the service provider  
❌ By manually configuring it through the web console  
❌ By calling the service provider's customer support  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **By sending an email request to the service provider** – Email is not a programmatic method and bypasses the purpose of an API.  
- ❌ **By manually configuring it through the web console** – This is a manual process, not an API-based automation.  
- ❌ **By calling the service provider's customer support** – This is a human-driven process, not an API integration.

# QUESTION 10
What is RDP Restricted Admin (RDPRA) Mode primarily used for?

✅ Mitigating the risk of credential compromise  
❌ Encrypting all RDP traffic with additional algorithms  
❌ Increasing the speed of remote connections  
❌ Allowing multiple users to share a single session  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **Encrypting all RDP traffic with additional algorithms** – Encryption is already part of RDP, not the specific purpose of RDPRA.  
- ❌ **Increasing the speed of remote connections** – RDPRA focuses on security, not performance enhancement.  
- ❌ **Allowing multiple users to share a single session** – This is unrelated to RDPRA’s function.

# QUESTION 11
Why is out-of-band management considered more secure than in-band management?

✅ It is managed over a separate, dedicated channel.  
❌ It operates over the production network.  
❌ It requires physical access to the device.  
❌ It uses stronger encryption algorithms.  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **It operates over the production network** – That describes in-band management, which is less secure because it shares traffic with production data.  
- ❌ **It requires physical access to the device** – Not true; out-of-band can be accessed remotely via its separate management channel.  
- ❌ **It uses stronger encryption algorithms** – Security comes from isolation, not necessarily stronger encryption.

# QUESTION 12
What does the AUX port connect to for remote access?

✅ An analog modem  
❌ A fiber optic cable  
❌ A wireless router  
❌ A digital modem  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **A fiber optic cable** – AUX ports aren’t used for high-speed fiber connections; they’re for serial/modem access.  
- ❌ **A wireless router** – AUX ports aren’t network interfaces; they’re for console/modem connections.  
- ❌ **A digital modem** – AUX ports typically connect to analog phone-line modems, not digital ones.

# QUESTION 13
What is the purpose of the scp command in SSH?

❌ To list files in the remote directory  
❌ To change the SSH server's configuration  
✅ To securely copy files between hosts  
❌ To generate a new SSH key pair  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To list files in the remote directory** – That’s done with commands like `ls` or `sftp`, not `scp`.  
- ❌ **To change the SSH server's configuration** – That requires editing configuration files, not using `scp`.  
- ❌ **To generate a new SSH key pair** – SSH key generation uses `ssh-keygen`, not `scp`.  
---
# QUESTION 14
What is the purpose of the ssh-agent command?

❌ To change the default SSH port  
❌ To restart the SSH server  
❌ To generate new SSH keys  
✅ To store private keys securely  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To change the default SSH port** – This is done by editing the SSH server config file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`), not with `ssh-agent`.  
- ❌ **To restart the SSH server** – That’s handled by system commands like `systemctl restart ssh`, not `ssh-agent`.  
- ❌ **To generate new SSH keys** – Key generation is done with `ssh-keygen`, not `ssh-agent`.  
---
# QUESTION 15
What is the role of an API in the context of a jump box and automation?

❌ To reduce the need for secure connections  
✅ To serve as an interface for automated scripting  
❌ To act as a physical firewall  
❌ To manually monitor network traffic  

Why the others are wrong:
- ❌ **To reduce the need for secure connections** – Secure connections are still critical; APIs don’t replace encryption or authentication.  
- ❌ **To act as a physical firewall** – An API is software-based and not a physical security device.  
- ❌ **To manually monitor network traffic** – APIs enable automation, not manual traffic inspection.
