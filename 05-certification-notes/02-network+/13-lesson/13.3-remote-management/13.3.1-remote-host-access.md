# SECTION 13.3.1 – Remote Host Access

A **remote access VPN** 🛡️ extends local network access over a public network 🌐 so a remote computer 💻 acts as if it’s physically joined to the local network.  
**Remote host access** = operating a computer or configuring a network appliance without being at the local terminal.  
It can be set up inside a local network 🏠 or over the internet 🌍.

- **🔧 Remote configuration of network appliances**  
  - Many are *headless* (no monitor or input devices 🖥️❌).  
  - Remote connection is often the only way.  
  - Common tool: **SSH** (Secure Shell) 🗝️.

- **🖥️ Remote desktop connections**  
  - Admins can configure servers 🛠️ or users can operate computers remotely.  
  - GUI access via protocols like **RDP** 🎨; some protocols are terminal-only 💬.

- **🚪 Remote desktop gateways**  
  - Give access to networked apps 📦.  
  - Can connect to a **virtual desktop** (OS + apps provisioned remotely).  
  - Can also work as a **clientless VPN**.

**⚓ Analogy – Big Ship**  
Your local network = **port city** 🏙️  
Your remote computer = **ship far out at sea** 🚢  

- **VPN** 🛳️ = a private shipping lane connecting your ship to the port.  
- **SSH** 📡 = sending dockside commands without stepping off the ship.  
- **RDP** 🎛️ = remotely controlling cranes in the harbor to load/unload cargo.  
- **Gateway** 🏢 = having a floating office delivered to your ship so you can work like you’re docked in port.
