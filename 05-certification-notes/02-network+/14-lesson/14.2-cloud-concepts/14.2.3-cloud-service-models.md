## 14.2.3 ‚Äì Cloud Service Models

- Service models define **how much control and responsibility** you have vs. the cloud provider.
- Often referred to as ‚ÄúX as a Service‚Äù (XaaS).
- Three main types: **IaaS**, **PaaS**, **SaaS**.

### üõ≥ Ship Analogy
- **IaaS** = You rent the ship, crew, and deck space ‚Äî but you decide what cargo to load, where to sail, and how to operate it.
- **PaaS** = You rent a fully equipped ship with specialized cargo bays ‚Äî you still decide what goods to trade, but the ship is set up for a certain type of journey.
- **SaaS** = You book passage on a cruise ‚Äî everything is run for you; you just enjoy the service.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Rent IT resources (servers, load balancers, SAN storage) as needed.
- You manage the OS, apps, and configurations; provider manages hardware and networking.
- Fast to provision; no physical purchases required.
- **Examples**: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, OpenStack.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Access fully developed software over the Internet.
- No need to install or manage locally ‚Äî provider handles everything.
- Pay-as-you-go or subscription.
- **Examples**: Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Sits between IaaS and SaaS.
- Provider delivers infrastructure **and** a development platform.
- You develop and run your own applications on the platform.
- Provider manages platform health; you manage your app‚Äôs security and function.
- **Examples**: Oracle Database Cloud, Azure SQL Database, Google App Engine.
