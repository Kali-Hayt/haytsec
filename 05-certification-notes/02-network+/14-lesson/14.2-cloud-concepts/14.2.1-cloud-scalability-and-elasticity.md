## 14.2.1 â€“ Cloud Scalability and Elasticity

### Overview
- **Cloud computing** = on-demand resources (servers, storage, databases, apps) over a network, typically the Internet.
- **Consumer view**: Pay only for what you use; no need to manage infrastructure details.
- **Provider view**: Similar to provisioning a large datacenter; relies heavily on virtualization for rapid, automated resource provisioning.

## ðŸ›³ Ship Analogy
- Think of the **cloud** as a large **fleet of ships**.
- **Scalability** = Adding more ships to carry more cargo (horizontal) or upgrading ships to carry more per trip (vertical).
- **Elasticity** = Adjusting fleet size in real time â€” if storm season hits and demand triples, more ships launch immediately; when seas are calm, extra ships return to port to save costs.

## Key Concepts

### **Scalability**
- Ability to increase resources in proportion to demand.
- If users double â†’ costs/resources to maintain same performance should also double or less.
- Achieved via:
  - **Horizontal scaling (scaling out)** â†’ add more nodes/ships.
  - **Vertical scaling (scaling up)** â†’ upgrade existing nodes/ships.

### **Elasticity**
- Ability to adapt to demand changes **in real time**.
- High elasticity = no loss in performance when demand spikes.
- Also allows cost reduction by **deprovisioning** when demand drops.

## How Itâ€™s Achieved
- **Automatic provisioning & deprovisioning** via:
  - **Resource pooling** â†’ hardware shared among customers, not locked to one.
  - **Virtualization** â†’ add CPU, memory, disk, or network capacity via software control (no physical trips to the datacenter).
