- Affects cost, performance, security, and control.
- Four main models: Public, Hosted Private, Private, Hybrid.

### ðŸ›³ Ship Analogy
- **Public** = Anyone can book space on the same ship.
- **Hosted Private** = A leased ship for your cargo only.
- **Private** = You own the ships.
- **Hybrid** = Use your ships but rent extra when needed.

---

## Public (Multitenant)
- Provided over the Internet by a **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)**.
- Pay-as-you-go or subscription.
- Shared resources = potential performance/security risks.
- **Multi-cloud** = using more than one CSP.

## Hosted Private (Single Tenant)
- Third-party hosted but exclusive to one organization.
- More secure & better performance.
- More expensive.

## Private
- Fully owned & managed by the organization.
- Greater control, privacy, and security.
- Common in government & finance.

## Hybrid
- Mix of public and private clouds.
- Example: Use private for most work, burst to public during high demand.
- Keeps sensitive workloads private, uses public for less critical needs.

## âœ… Key Point
- Flexibility is a major benefit.
- Moving data between public & private clouds introduces **data risk** â€” requires strong handling policies.
