# QUESTION 1
What is a key advantage of cloud computing, especially in hybrid models?

❌ Lower cost  
✅ Flexibility  
❌ Exclusive use  
❌ Higher security  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Lower cost** – While cost savings can happen, it’s not guaranteed and isn’t the primary advantage of hybrid models.  
- ❌ **Exclusive use** – Exclusive use applies more to private or single-tenant clouds, not hybrids.  
- ❌ **Higher security** – Security can be strong, but it’s not inherently higher in hybrids without proper configuration.

# QUESTION 2
What is meant by cloud elasticity?

❌ The ability to add more storage to the cloud system as needed  
✅ The ability for a cloud system to adjust resources in real-time  
❌ The use of multiple cloud providers to ensure data redundancy  
❌ The process of moving data from one cloud provider to another  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Add more storage as needed** – This is a form of scalability, not elasticity.  
- ❌ **Multiple cloud providers for redundancy** – This describes multi-cloud or high availability, not elasticity.  
- ❌ **Moving data between providers** – That’s cloud migration, not elasticity.

# QUESTION 3
Which of the following is an example of Software as a Service (SaaS)?

❌ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  
✅ Microsoft Office 365  
❌ OpenStack  
❌ Oracle Database  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** – This is an IaaS service, not SaaS.  
- ❌ **OpenStack** – This is an open-source cloud computing platform, more aligned with IaaS/PaaS.  
- ❌ **Oracle Database** – Typically offered as PaaS or installed on-premises, not SaaS.

# QUESTION 4
Which cloud service model allows businesses to rent IT resources such as servers and storage on an as-needed basis?

❌ PaaS  
❌ DaaS  
❌ SaaS  
✅ IaaS  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **PaaS** – Provides a platform for app development, not raw IT resources.  
- ❌ **DaaS** – Desktop as a Service, focused on virtual desktop environments, not full infrastructure.  
- ❌ **SaaS** – Provides software applications over the internet, not the underlying infrastructure.

# QUESTION 5
How do CDN servers ensure that the content they deliver is current?

❌ By requiring manual updates from the content owner  
❌ By only serving static content that doesn't change  
✅ By replicating content to remain current with each other  
❌ By deleting outdated content  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Manual updates** – CDNs automatically sync content; they don’t rely solely on manual pushes.  
- ❌ **Only serving static content** – CDNs handle both static and dynamic content; limiting to static doesn’t ensure freshness.  
- ❌ **Deleting outdated content** – While outdated data can be removed, freshness is ensured through replication, not deletion alone.

# QUESTION 6
Which cloud service model is best suited for businesses that want to be responsible for developing their own solutions on a provided platform but keeping their data on a third-party secured server?

❌ SaaS  
✅ PaaS  
❌ FaaS  
❌ IaaS  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **SaaS** – Provides complete software solutions; you don’t develop on it yourself.  
- ❌ **FaaS** – Function as a Service is for running small code functions without managing servers, not full platform development.  
- ❌ **IaaS** – Provides raw infrastructure, but no development platform — you’d need to build the platform yourself.

# QUESTION 7
What is a characteristic of a hosted private cloud?

✅ Exclusive use by one organization  
❌ Mixed public/private solution  
❌ Shared resources among multiple organizations  
❌ Lower-tier services offered free of charge  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Mixed public/private solution** – This describes a hybrid cloud, not a hosted private cloud.  
- ❌ **Shared resources among multiple organizations** – This is a public cloud model, not private.  
- ❌ **Lower-tier services free of charge** – Common in public clouds, not hosted private.  
---
# QUESTION 8
Which of the following best describes the relationship between scalability and costs in a cloud system?

❌ Costs are unrelated to scalability.  
✅ Costs increase linearly or less than linearly as the system scales.  
❌ Costs decrease exponentially as the system scales.  
❌ Costs remain constant regardless of how much the system scales.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Unrelated to scalability** – Cost is directly tied to resource usage when scaling.  
- ❌ **Decrease exponentially** – Scaling up resources increases cost, not decreases it.  
- ❌ **Remain constant** – Costs grow with usage; they don’t stay fixed.  
---
# QUESTION 9
How does elasticity differ from scalability in cloud computing?

❌ Elasticity is about adding more resources, while scalability is about removing resources.  
✅ Elasticity focuses on real-time adjustments, while scalability is about long-term growth.  
❌ Scalability involves using multiple cloud providers, whereas elasticity does not.  
❌ Scalability is a technology, while elasticity is a business strategy.  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Adding vs removing resources** – Both elasticity and scalability can involve adding or removing; the difference lies in timing and purpose.  
- ❌ **Multiple cloud providers** – This refers to multi-cloud, not scalability vs elasticity.  
- ❌ **Technology vs business strategy** – Both are technical capabilities, not just a business concept.

# QUESTION 10
What does a public cloud deployment model offer?

❌ Complete privacy and control over infrastructure  
❌ Higher security and performance at a lower cost  
❌ Exclusive use by one organization  
✅ Services over the Internet to multiple tenants  

Why the others are wrong:  
- ❌ **Complete privacy and control** – That’s a private cloud, not public.  
- ❌ **Higher security and performance at lower cost** – Public clouds can be cost-effective, but security/performance depends on configuration and isn’t inherently higher.  
- ❌ **Exclusive use by one organization** – That’s single-tenant or private cloud, not public.
