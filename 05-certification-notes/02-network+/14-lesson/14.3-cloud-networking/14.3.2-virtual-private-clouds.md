## 14.3.2 â€“ Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)

- CSP uses a **virtualization layer** to abstract the datacenterâ€™s physical network.
- Isolates each tenantâ€™s network traffic from others, even in a public cloud environment.
- VPCs provide tenants with their own logically isolated virtual network.

### ðŸ›³ Ship Analogy
- Imagine a giant harbor (public cloud) with many docks.
- **VPC** = your own private dock, fenced off from others.  
  No other ships can dock there without your permission, even though the water is shared.

## Tenant-Configured Cloud Networking Contexts
- Networks used by the tenant to operate and manage cloud systems.
- Virtual networks linking VMs and containers.
- Virtual networks for publishing services to guests/customers online.

---

## VPC Characteristics
- A VPC is **isolated** from:
  - Other CSP customer accounts.
  - Other VPCs within the same account.
- Communication between VPCs requires explicit routing configuration.
- Supports IPv4 and optional IPv6 CIDR blocks.
- Can contain multiple subnets.

---

## Vendor Notes
- AWS: Primary focus here.
- Microsoft Azure: Similar function called **virtual networks**.
- Other CSPs: Same concept with different naming.

---

## âœ… Key Point
- VPCs let you create secure, segmented networks in the cloud with full control over IP ranges, subnets, and routing.
