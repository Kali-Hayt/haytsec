## 14.3.6 Security Groups and Security Lists

- **AWS Security Groups**  
  - Basic packet filtering rules that manage what traffic each instance will accept.  
  - Provide **stateful inbound and outbound filtering** at **layer 4**.  
    - *Stateful* means once a connection is allowed, established and related traffic is also allowed automatically.  
  - **Default Security Group**:
    - Allows any outbound traffic.
    - Allows inbound traffic from instances in the same security group.
  - **Custom Security Group**:
    - Defines allowed ports and endpoints for inbound/outbound traffic.
    - No explicit deny rules — traffic not matching an allow rule is dropped.
    - Custom group with no rules will block all traffic.
  - Multiple instances can share a security group.
  - Instances in the same subnet can have different security groups.
  - Multiple security groups can be assigned to one instance.
  - Security groups can also be assigned to **VPC endpoint interfaces**.

- **Other Cloud Providers**  
  - **Azure**:  
    - Uses *Network Security Groups*.
    - Can be applied to network interfaces or subnets.
  - **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**:
    - Uses *Security Lists* — a set of rules applying to an **entire subnet**.
    - OCI *Security Groups* are similar to AWS but can apply to selected network interfaces.
