## 14.3.3 â€“ Cloud Gateways

- **Gateway** = Network route used by instances in a VPC subnet to communicate:
  - With other subnets in the same VPC.
  - With subnets in other VPCs.
  - With the Internet.

### ðŸ›³ Ship Analogy
- Think of a **gateway** like a harbor exit checkpoint.
- **Internet gateway** = Open water route allowing ships to sail in and out freely.
- **NAT gateway** = One-way shipping lane â€” your ships can leave port, but no foreign ships can dock.
- **VPN** = A private underwater tunnel connecting your port to another secure harbor.

## Public vs. Private Subnets
- **Public subnet** requires:
  1. **Internet gateway** attached to the VPC.
  2. Internet gateway set as default route.
  3. Public IPs assigned to instances.
- If no default route is set, the subnet remains private even with an Internet gateway.

## Gateway Types
- **Internet Gateway**
  - Two-way access (inbound & outbound) between VPC and Internet.
  - Requires public IP address for each connected instance.
- **NAT Gateway**
  - Outbound-only Internet access.
  - No inbound connections from the Internet.
  - No public IP required for connected instances.
- **VPN**
  - Secure connection between VPCs or between VPC and on-premises networks.
  - Can be CSP-managed or software-based.

## âœ… Key Point
- Internet Gateway = public access.
- NAT Gateway = outbound-only.
- VPN = secure private link between locations.
