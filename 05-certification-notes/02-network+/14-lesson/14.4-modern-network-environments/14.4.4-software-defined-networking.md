## 14.4.4 Software-Defined Networking

- **SDN Purpose**: Rapid provisioning/deprovisioning of servers & networks using automation, orchestration, and overlay networks for quick, reliable point-to-point links. Fully scriptable — ideal for Infrastructure as Code.

### Key SDN Properties
- **Central policy management** – One “source of truth” for network rules, converted into device configs automatically. Central management, distributed enforcement, with unified monitoring.
- **Transport agnostic** – Works over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G/5G, leased lines, satellite; auto-configures logical links.
- **Zero-touch provisioning** – Automates new node configuration; reconfigures automatically if policies change.
- **Application aware** – Detects traffic types (voice, video, IoT) and reserves bandwidth for performance & low latency.

### SDN Architecture (IETF model)
- **Application layer** – Business logic for traffic decisions, security, segmentation, ACLs, prioritization.
- **Infrastructure layer** – Physical/virtual devices for forwarding, switching, routing, ACL enforcement.
- **Control layer (innovation)** – Between application & infrastructure; implemented by an **SDN controller**. Uses APIs for automation.
  - **Northbound API** – Between applications & controller.
  - **Southbound API** – Between controller & infrastructure devices.

### Management Plane
- Separate from forwarding (data) & operational planes.
- **Operational plane** – Tracks device state (CPU, memory usage).
- **Management plane** – Interfaces with control plane to monitor traffic and network status.
