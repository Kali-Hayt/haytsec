## 14.4.2 Uses for IaC

### Non-persistence & Templates
- **Non-persistence**: Instances are static; data stored separately so systems can be replaced easily.
- **Methods**:
  - **Master Image**: Prebuilt “gold” copy of VM/container with OS/apps.
  - **Automated Build from Template**: Build instructions generate instance on demand.

### Upgrades
- Moving to newer OS/software versions.
- Must be planned as major changes—test, rollback, dependency mapping.
- Automation can:
  - Speed test deployments.
  - Check compatibility.
  - Roll out upgrades efficiently.

### Dynamic Inventories
- Track cloud instances like physical inventory.
- Use **tags** for identification and ownership.
- Prevent **sprawl**: Unmanaged/undocumented instances.
- Configure logging and monitoring.

### Reusable Tasks
- Minimize script/code quantity to avoid bugs.
- Reusable modules/functions adapt to different inputs and contexts.
- Avoid separate scripts—use libraries for scalability and consistency.
