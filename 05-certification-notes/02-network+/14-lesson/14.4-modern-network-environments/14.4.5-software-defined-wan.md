## 14.4.5 â€“ Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN)

- Traditional **hub-and-spoke** WAN designs can be slow and less reliable for branch offices and remote sites.
- **SD-WAN** replaces hub-and-spoke with more efficient, still secure connectivity to corporate clouds.
- Allows branch offices to connect directly to the cloud or data center without routing everything through the hub.
- Uses **automation & orchestration** to dynamically adjust links based on:
  - Application requirements
  - Network congestion
- Secures traffic with **IPSec tunnels** through the transport network.
- Supports **microsegmentation** and **zero-trust policies** to authenticate and authorize all requests.

### How It Works
- Managed by an **SD-WAN controller** and management software in a corporate data center or cloud.
- Each site has an **SD-WAN-capable router, gateway, or VPN app**.
- Controller orchestrates connections across multiple sites and networks in the SD-WAN.
- Can use any available IP network:
  - Broadband Internet
  - 4G/5G cellular
  - Private **MPLS VPNs**
- Chooses the **fastest/most reliable path** for each connection.
- Ensures all access requests are authenticated and authorized.
