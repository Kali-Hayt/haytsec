## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

Slept in a bit this morning—felt like I needed the rest. No guilt about it. Today’s a lighter day by design. The plan is to wrap up the last two lessons of Cloud+, keeping things easy and steady.

This weekend is all about Cloud+ final prep: finishing the course, locking in the material, and hitting the practice exams hard until I feel ready to take the real thing.

If all goes well, I’ll shift back into full Networking+ mode on Monday, focused and ready to crush the rest of the course.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection  

Today I completed Cloud+ lessons 9 and 10, which marks the end of the course content. I still need to complete the required discussion board post, but my main focus now shifts to preparing for the course final exam. My plan is to spend the next two days reviewing key topics—especially security, automation, and deployment models—and to take the final exam this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday. Once the Cloud+ course is complete, I’ll begin CompTIA Network+ studies on Monday.
