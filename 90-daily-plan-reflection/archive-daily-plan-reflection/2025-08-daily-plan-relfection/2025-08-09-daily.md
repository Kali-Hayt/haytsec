## üß† Notes & Learnings ‚Äì Network+
# Section 13.2
- Practiced configuring different types of VPN connections, including remote access and device-specific setups.  
- Learned how to configure and test a RADIUS solution for centralized authentication.  
- Reinforced understanding of VPN protocols, authentication methods, and secure remote access design.  
- Hands-on labs helped solidify the difference between client-based and clientless VPNs in real scenarios.  
# Section 13.3
- Remote management is essential for controlling devices without being physically present.  
- SSH is the secure go-to; Telnet is outdated and insecure but still tested.  
- RDP provides full graphical control, great for Windows environments.  
- Out-of-band management is critical when the main network is down.  
- Jump boxes act as a single, controlled gateway for admin access, reducing attack surfaces.  
- APIs allow automation and integration, enabling management via scripts.  
- Always restrict access, enforce encryption, and log activity for security. 
# Section 14.1
- Completed Datacenter and Storage Networks section.  
- Learned SANs use block-level I/O for high-performance storage access.  
- Understood NVMe-oF for using NVMe storage over networks.  
- Learned why SAN traffic is separated from production networks to prevent performance issues.  
- Reviewed Fibre Channel and spine-leaf topology for efficient data center design.  
- Practiced configuring iSCSI targets and initiators in labs.  
- Gained confidence in both theory and practical setup.
# Section 14.2
- Cloud scalability = grow resources as demand grows; elasticity = adjust resources in real time.  
- Public, private, hosted private, and hybrid clouds differ by ownership, control, and usage.  
- IaaS, PaaS, SaaS = increasing levels of provider control, decreasing customer management.  
- CDNs place content closer to users for faster delivery, high availability, and scalability.  
- Hybrid models offer flexibility but require careful data risk management.
# Section 14.3
- Cloud instances = virtual servers for running workloads.  
- VPCs = isolated cloud networks with custom IP ranges.  
- Cloud gateways connect VPCs to the internet or other networks.  
- Connectivity options: VPN, Direct Connect, Transit Gateway.  
- Firewalls segment traffic for performance and compliance.  
- Security groups = stateful, instance-level filters; security lists = subnet-level.  
# Section 14.4
- Learned how **Infrastructure as Code** automates provisioning and prevents unique, hard-to-reproduce (‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù) systems.  
- Reviewed **SDN** and **SD-WAN** concepts, focusing on centralized control and transport-agnostic design.  
- Understood **overlay networks** like VXLAN and their role in data center scalability.  
- Explored **Zero Trust Architecture**, emphasizing continuous verification and least privilege access.  
- Studied **SASE** and its integration of SD-WAN with Security Service Edge technologies like CASB and SWG.  
- Reinforced knowledge of cloud models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment types (public, private, community).  
- Completed **Module 14.5 Quiz** ‚Äî strong grasp of modern network environments.

## üå§Ô∏è Morning Journal
 
 I am feeling solid about wrapping up the Network+ course today as it is nearly finished. To avoid burnout, I will take breaks and maintain consistency with a clear mind. I will write an early evening journal when planning to take a break to capture my thoughts and prepare for the late evening process and feelings.

## üåô Early Evening Journal

Networking+ went well today, completing Lesson 13 after a recharging lunch and a short nap. I am feeling energized and confident as Lesson 14 is the final step before the course‚Äôs final exam. I am proud of the progress made and steady in my momentum.

## üåô Late Evening Journal

I have completed the Network+ modules and feel proud of the hard work I have accomplished. My goal now is to practice for the exam and review the material to fill in any gaps and clarify questions. I will complete lab activities if possible. The final exam is due by August 15th, and I might take it earlier. I am wrapping up here and will continue with Hack The Box practice. The HaytSec project is deferred for now.
