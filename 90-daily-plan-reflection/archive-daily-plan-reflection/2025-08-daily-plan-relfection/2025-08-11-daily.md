## 🌤️ Morning Journal
 
 This morning, with a clear and rested mind, I developed a new strategy: to hold off on practice exams and instead revisit the entire Network+ curriculum. My plan is to watch lecture and tutorial videos on YouTube, review online resources, work on acronyms, practice IP subnetting, and clarify any foggy areas for a full and thorough understanding throughout the day.

## 🌙 Early Evening Journal  

I spent the morning completing my review of the Module 1 video on the OSI layers, making sure to capture clear and concise notes in Obsidian for future study. This covered each layer’s function, encapsulation, and PDUs, giving me a solid foundation to build on.  

Now, in the early evening, I’m taking a short break to recharge and reset my focus before moving on to Module 2, which will cover the TCP/IP model. I want to approach the next section with a fresh mind so I can fully absorb the details and link them back to what I’ve already learned about OSI.

## 🌙 Late Evening Journal

The evening went very well — I watched Network+ CompTIA videos on YouTube, covering modules 1–4. This helped fill in some gaps and gave me useful clarifications during my review. I also created exam-ready prep notes, which I’m feeling confident about.  

Overall, it was a productive night. My next focus is to practice subnetting and subnet masks to sharpen that skill.
