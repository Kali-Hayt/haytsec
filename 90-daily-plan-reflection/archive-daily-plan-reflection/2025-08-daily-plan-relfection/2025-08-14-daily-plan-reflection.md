## 🌤 Morning Reflection
This morning I feel very rested and focused on preparing for the Fall semester by cleaning up and organizing my Obsidian setup. I feel motivated and am looking forward to starting this new chapter when the semester begins on August 25th. I also created an Obsidian Sync account so I can keep my work updated between both systems throughout the Fall semester.

## 🌇 Evening Reflection
This evening I felt refreshed after taking a good nap to recover from the late night review and final exam. My morning was spent preparing Obsidian and doing some cleanup along with tasks to get things ready for following up. As the day wound down I turned my focus to preparing the MacBook for sale by wiping it clean and getting macOS reinstalled. I also installed VirtualBox on my Dell to try it out and see how it fits into my workflow. I am also considering purchasing a second system to fully install Linux or possibly installing it directly onto the Dell. By tomorrow I plan to begin the process of selling the MacBook.

## 🌌 Night Reflection
I successfully cleaned up my MacBook back to macOS and it’s now ready to sell.  
As it’s getting late, I’ll aim to try out VirtualBox tomorrow or Saturday, depending on time.  
Staying on track with preparations for Fall, and planning to use Linux on VirtualBox temporarily while deciding on a second system.  
I’ll be researching which laptop I want to purchase next for a full Linux setup.
