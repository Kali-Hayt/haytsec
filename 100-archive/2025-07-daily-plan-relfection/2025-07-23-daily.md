## 🧠 Notes & Learnings – Labs 6.4.6 & 6.4.7 

- APIPA (`169.254.x.x`) indicates the client is set to DHCP but failed to receive a lease.
- DHCP scope exhaustion happens when the address pool is fully assigned — clients fallback to APIPA.
- Expanding the scope range (e.g., `.1`–`.254`) resolves pool exhaustion by allowing more leases.
- Static IPs are useful for testing or temporary fixes but should be switched back to DHCP once the issue is resolved.
- The Exec office uses **CorpServer** for DHCP and internet routing — small internal scope.
- The Office (e.g., Marketing, Sales) uses **CorpDHCP** for address leasing and **CorpServer** as the gateway.
- DHCP scope must be **activated** for clients to receive leases.
- The **003 Router option** in DHCP specifies the default gateway clients should use — incorrect settings break internet access.
- Subnet mask mismatches between clients and servers prevent local communication and cause failed pings.
- A client must have a default gateway in the **same subnet** to route traffic to the internet.

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  
  
I'm feeling grounded and ready to make solid progress on my networking assignments today. Yesterday moved at a slower pace—I gave myself room to rest and recover from some mental exhaustion. That reset helped. I'm feeling clear-headed now and ready to lock in. Later this evening, I plan to shift focus back to HaytSec and move forward on some key project work.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection  

Today’s labs really helped connect the dots between DHCP theory and practical troubleshooting. I saw firsthand how something as simple as an exhausted scope or incorrect subnet mask can break connectivity — not just to the internet, but even within the LAN.

At first, I assumed a failed IP lease was just a client issue, but the lab forced me to trace the real causes:
- Scope size too small
- Router option misconfigured
- Subnet mismatch on the Exec machine

It reminded me how important it is to *start at Layer 1 and work up* — don’t skip assumptions. The green lights don’t always mean everything’s good beyond the cable.

Fixing the DHCP scope and router option, then re-enabling DHCP on the Exec machine, felt like a full-circle move. Static config is a crutch — DHCP is automation and future-proofing.

By the end of Lab 6.4.7, I was thinking like a network admin, not just a student. I understood not only what was wrong but why it mattered in a real enterprise setup. That’s growth.

I’m ready to pause Networking+ for the night and shift my focus tomorrow to finishing Cloud+ strong.
