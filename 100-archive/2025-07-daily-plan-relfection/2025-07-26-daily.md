## 🔥 Focus of the Day  

My focus today is to complete the discussion board, which is the final assignment for the Cloud+ course this summer term. After that, I'll shift my attention to reviewing the Cloud+ material and practicing for the exam. My goal is to take the final exam either tomorrow or Sunday—whichever day I feel fully prepared. Later this evening, I plan to continue working on the HaytSec project for a few hours.

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

This morning I feel mentally prepared to focus on reviewing and practicing for the Cloud+ exam. Today’s tasks are lighter by design with no pressure, no overwhelm, and no distractions. My priority is to stay present, work through each part of the exam material with clarity, and truly understand it. I want to avoid burnout or frustration, and I will take breaks to recharge when needed. There is no rush, only steady and thoughtful progress.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection

I practiced the Cloud+ exam a few times today and reviewed the incorrect answers, filling in some gaps. I also skimmed through another part of the practice exam—it wasn’t too bad. Now I’m wrapping up and shifting my focus to the HaytSec project. My goal is to review a bit more and take the Cloud+ final exam tomorrow to finish the course and close out the summer term.
