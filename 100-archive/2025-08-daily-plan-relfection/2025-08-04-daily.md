# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-08-04
## 🔥 Focus of the Day

My focus today is to stay consistent with Network+ assignments and make steady progress as the due date approaches. Later this evening, if time allows, I’ll either work on Hack The Box or continue with HaytSec. The overall goal is to keep everything on track and push forward with purpose without burning out mentally.

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings – Network+
## Sections: 10.1
- Kerberos is the go-to for Windows SSO — uses TGTs to request service tickets.
- Secure key storage = protect against unauthorized access, not convenience.
- PKI: Certificate Authority (CA) validates certs, doesn’t hand out keys.
- Two-factor auth = two *different* categories (e.g., password + smart card).
- Claims-based identity = core to federated identity management.
- Behavioral, location, and time factors are weak *alone* — too inconsistent.
- Cryptographic hashes store passwords to prevent easy compromise.

✅ Solid understanding of key management, auth models, and PKI basics.

## Sections: 10.2
- **Authorization ≠ Authentication** → AuthZ = "what you can do"
- **RBAC** = roles tied to job duties; not user identity
- **PAM** = limits power, enforces least privilege + separation of duties
- **LDAP** = protocol to query/update directory info (uses DN structure)
- **LDAPS** = secure version of LDAP (TLS, port 636)
- **Group Policy (GPO)** = used to enforce domain-wide password + lockout rules
- **Least Privilege** = only what’s needed, no more
## Sections: 10.3
- 🔐 **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security > just a firewall.
- 🛠️ **Hardening**: Change defaults, disable unused services, enforce strong creds.
- 🐧 **Linux Services**: Use `systemctl` to start/stop/enable/disable services.
- 🔍 **Recon**: Use WHOIS, nslookup, Zenmap to find open/insecure ports (FTP, Telnet, RDP).
- ❌ **Disable Risky Services**: Shut down VNC, RDP if not approved.
- 🔐 **RBAC**: Only give access based on role, not identity.
- 📏 **Passwords**: Aim for 14+ characters, avoid anything common.
- 🌐 **Modern Edge**: Network edge includes switches, wireless, cloud — not just the firewall.
## Sections: 10.4
- EAP is a **framework**, not a protocol. Used during **network access authentication** (e.g., Wi-Fi, 802.1X).
- **802.1X** = port-based access control. Roles: Supplicant (user), Authenticator (switch), RADIUS server.
- **Rogue admins** are still a threat even with locked ports — technical controls ≠ human trust.
- **MAC filtering** controls which devices connect to a port. Simple, but MACs can be spoofed.
- **Port mirroring** copies traffic to another port for analysis (SPAN). Don’t overuse it — high CPU load risk.
- **DAI** = stops ARP spoofing. **ND Inspection** = IPv6 version.
- **DHCP Snooping** blocks rogue DHCP servers. Builds IP–MAC trust table used by DAI.
- **BPDU Guard** and **Root Guard** stop rogue switches from hijacking spanning tree elections.
- **Port security**: “Lock” mode learns MAC, “Discard” drops violations without alerts.
- **Health policies** in NAC require the device to prove it's safe (attestation reports, AV, patches, etc.).
## Sections: 10.5
- **ACLs control network traffic** by allowing or denying packets based on rules (IP, port, protocol).
- **Firewalls** can be misconfigured easily — order of rules matters, and "implicit deny" is always at the end.
- **Proxy servers** sit between clients and servers, helping with security, caching, and traffic control.
- **Content filtering** stops access to unwanted or risky content, like malware or inappropriate websites.
- Hands-on labs showed how to:
  - Create and troubleshoot ACLs.
  - Configure access (Telnet/SSH).
  - Permit or block specific traffic types or sources.
- **Public key cryptography** solves the key distribution problem by using asymmetric keys.
- **Defense in depth** means layering multiple controls (not just a single firewall).
- **DAI (Dynamic ARP Inspection)** protects against ARP spoofing by validating ARP packets.
- **Strong MFA** includes something you know (password), have (token), and are (biometrics).

## ✍️ Morning Journal / Reflection

I’m feeling solid and ready to take on a full day of Network+ study. The deadline is approaching fast, so it’s time to keep pushing forward with focus and consistency. I also aim to knock out a few tasks outside of Network+ and check them off my log. To stay sharp and avoid burnout, I’ll be sure to take proper rest and a solid lunch break.

## 🌙 Late Evening Reflection  

Today, I successfully completed **Lesson 10** of the Network+ curriculum. This module included an extensive series of lab assignments, which provided valuable hands-on experience in firewall configuration, ACL creation, and troubleshooting common network access issues.

I'm proud of the consistency and discipline I’ve maintained throughout this process. The technical depth of this lesson was both challenging and rewarding, reinforcing critical concepts through practical application.

As the day comes to a close, my focus shifts to rest and recovery in preparation for the next phase of study. Progress continues, one disciplined step at a time.

**Next Objective:** Begin Lesson 11 with clarity and readiness.
