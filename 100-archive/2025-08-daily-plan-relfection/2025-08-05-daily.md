## 🧠 Notes & Learnings – Network+
# Section 11.1
- **Zones** = network areas with different trust levels (e.g., LAN, DMZ, WAN).
- **DMZ** = public-facing zone; buffers between internet & internal network.
- **Screened Subnet** = 2 firewalls (edge + internal); better control & isolation.
- **Choke Point** = traffic control zone; filters entry/exit.
- **Perimeter Network** = same as DMZ; used for public services (web, email).
- **IPS vs IDS**:
  - **IPS** = blocks threats inline ✅
  - **IDS** = detects & alerts only ❌
- **Snort on pfSense** = IPS tool; uses rules to detect/block traffic.
- **False Positive** = blocks legit traffic 🚫
- **VLANs** = logical segmentation; creates isolated broadcast domains.
- **Firewall** = enforces rules between zones (DMZ ↔ LAN etc.)
# Section 11.2
- **ICS/SCADA Risks**: Connecting ICS/SCADA to corporate networks introduces exploitable links. 🛠️ Security hardening is critical.
- **PLCs**: Act as the **brains** of industrial systems – they **control machinery and processes**, not store data or firewall traffic.
- **Smart Device Vulnerabilities**: Integrated peripherals can increase **surveillance risk**. Functionality = attack surface.
- **Smart Building Tech**: Designed with **less scope for compromise** than consumer-grade IoT – stronger security design.
- **Attack Surface**: Smart devices are vulnerable due to **compute, storage, and network functions**, not isolation.
- **NB-IoT Advantage**: Offers **greater signal penetration**, ideal for low-power, wide-area use – not faster speeds or unlimited data.
- **OT vs IT Networks**: OT = real-time optimized for process control. IT = data flow. Timing > bandwidth.
- **Data Historian**: Special database that **records process data** over time for ICS systems – not backups or protocols.
- **Static Computing Environments**: Minimal change, **limited patching**, predictable configurations = reduced risk but more exposure if outdated.
- **IoT Risk Mitigation**: Prioritize **user training and audits** over relying on tech limits. Human awareness is key 🔍.
# Section 11.3
- **Locks** = basic physical control; used for access restriction to doors, racks, and equipment.
- **Cameras** = detective control; fixed vs PTZ; IP cams can use PoE and network cabling.
- **Geofencing** = virtual perimeter using GPS or IPS; can trigger policies like reauthentication or camera lockout.
- **Badge readers** = authenticate users quickly at access points; more efficient than traditional keys.
- **Anomaly-based IDS** = detects unknown threats by comparing traffic to a learned baseline.
- **CCTV as a preventative measure** requires **a guard to monitor** in real-time—not just cameras alone.

🧩 Key takeaway: Physical security and logical controls must work together to create layered defense.

## ✍️ Morning Journal / Reflection  

I slept in this morning due to staying up all night working on a health system update and installation during my free time. I ended up going to bed around sunrise. My goal for today is to go to bed early in order to reset my schedule and restore balance.

I feel today will be manageable, as Network+ Lesson 11 is relatively light compared to previous sections. Once I complete Lesson 11, I plan to move forward into Lesson 12 to maintain momentum, if possible.

Despite the late night, my energy level feels steady, and my mood is focused and optimistic about the day ahead.

## 🌙 Late Evening Reflection  

Today moved at a slow but steady pace. Despite a late start, I remained focused on my Network+ coursework and successfully completed Lesson 11. Overall, I stayed committed and kept my momentum.

I also ordered some new computer equipment earlier in the day. That process introduced a bit of distraction and briefly pulled my focus away from coursework, but it provided a necessary mental break after a rough start.

As I wind down, I plan to spend a little time on Hack The Box, doing light practice before heading to bed but-not too late. The goal is to stay sharp without burning out.

### 📌 Goals for Tomorrow

Stay consistent with Network+ progress
Start the day early and focused  
Unbox and configure the new computer gear
Balance coursework with hands-on practice  
Keep a healthy pace and prioritize rest

🧠 Consistency > intensity. Steady effort builds lasting results.
