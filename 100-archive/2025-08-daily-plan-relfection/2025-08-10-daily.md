## 🌙 Early Evening Journal

I’ve been reviewing and practicing for the Network+ exam. Everything went well until the third practice test, when I started to feel mentally tired. I’m going to take a short break to recharge so I can return to practice with better focus and energy.

## 🌙 Late Evening Journal

This evening I completed a cold practice exam, fully expecting that it would reveal areas needing improvement. As anticipated, it highlighted topics that require review to fill knowledge gaps and clarify my understanding. Tomorrow morning, I will focus on subnetting and IP addressing before moving on to two large practice exams. The goal is to strengthen comprehension and achieve better results through targeted review and practice.
