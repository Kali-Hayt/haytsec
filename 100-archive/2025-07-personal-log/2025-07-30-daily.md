# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-07-30

## 🔥 Focus of the Day  

Today’s focus will be on making solid progress in the Network+ course after I return from running a couple of errands. My goal is to complete as much of the assignment as possible, since the course is nearing its deadline on August 15th.

Later this evening, before wrapping up for the night, I plan to switch over to HaytSec and review my current progress there. The goal is to keep momentum going on both fronts.

## 🎯 Goals

- [x] Complete Network+ Lesson 6.5.14-Lab (Current)
- [x] Complete Network+ Lesson 6 
- [ ] Complete Network+ Lesson 7 (7.2.8-lab)
- [ ] HaytSec Project (Deffered)

### ✅ Achieved-Network+

- Completed section 6.6.6: **Lab: Use nslookup**
- Verified internal vs external **MX records**
- Reached section 7.2.7: **Database Services**
- Practiced DNS record types (SOA, NS, A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, SRV, TXT, PTR)
- Used `nslookup` and `dig` effectively for DNS resolution

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings-Network+

## DNS Tools: `nslookup` vs `dig`

- `nslookup` = quick and interactive; older but works on both Windows and Linux  
- `dig` = detailed output; not on Windows by default; better for scripting

**Use Cases**
- `nslookup` → Good for verifying DNS names, checking mail servers, querying internal DNS  
- `dig` → Better when you need full record breakdowns, TTLs, flags, etc.

**Examples**
- `nslookup haytsec.com` → resolves A/AAAA record  
- `nslookup -type=MX haytsec.com` → shows mail server records  
- `dig haytsec.com any` → dumps all available record types  

## DNS Resolution Flow

- Internal DNS is prioritized in corporate networks
- If internal DNS can't resolve → forwards to external resolver (like 8.8.8.8)
- MX records are crucial for mail flow; must point to valid, reachable domain

## Mental Models

- Think of **DNS** like a **phonebook**:  
  - You ask for a name, it gives you a number (IP address)
- **MX record** = "Where do I send the mail for this domain?"  
- **PTR record** = "Who owns this IP?" (reverse lookup)

_🧱 Continue reinforcing server roles and their DNS usage. Practice finding services using `nmap` next (7.2.8)._

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

I’m feeling solid and confident about today’s progress with Network+. The plan is to move efficiently and stay focused. To avoid burnout, I’ll make sure to take breaks when needed—rest, reset, and then get back to work. It’s all about maintaining balance and staying consistent.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection

Made **solid progress** today—kept the momentum going and stayed focused through multiple DNS sections and tools. Got hands-on with `nslookup` and even dug into `dig`. Feeling more confident navigating DNS record types, resolution paths, and how to validate configurations in real-world environments.

✅ Reached **section 7.2.8 (Lab: Use nmap for Services)**—right on track.
