# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-07-28

## 🔥 Focus of the Day  

Today, my focus is to fully shift into the Network+ course after completing Cloud+ yesterday.  
I’ve set a study goal to complete Network+ by **August 10th**, which means completing approximately **one lesson per day to day and a half**, depending on the module. The final exam is scheduled for **August 15th**, so I’ll need a few days for review and practice.

Currently, I’m working on **Lesson 6.4.8 – Troubleshoot IP Configuration 1**.  
Today's goal is to finish the rest of Lesson 6 and make as much progress into Lesson 7 as possible.

## 🎯 Goals

- [x] Complete Lesson 6.4.8-lab (Current)
- [ ] Complete Lesson 6 (~)
- [ ] HaytSec Project (Deffered)

---

### ✅ Achieved

- Completed sections **6.5.4 to 6.5.10** of Network+ DNS lessons:
  - 🧱 Resource Records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, SRV, SOA)
  - 🔍 Pointer (PTR) records and reverse lookup zones
  - 🛠️ DNS Server configuration: zone types, TTL, caching
  - 🌐 Internal vs External DNS (corp vs public exposure)
  - 🔐 DNS Security: DNSSEC, DoT, DoH
- Created study markdown
- Confirmed TTL math & behavior (86400 = 1 day, lower TTL = shorter caching)
- Made solid progress on knowledge gaps from 6.5.3 through 6.5.6
- Prepped for Lab 6.5.11 (Configure DNS Addresses)

---

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings

- **PTR records** work in reverse: IP ➡ domain, stored in `in-addr.arpa` (IPv4) or `ip6.arpa` (IPv6) zones
- **Forward lookup zones** resolve names to IPs; **reverse lookup zones** do the opposite
- TTL is in seconds—**lower = faster updates**, **higher = less DNS load**
- **Authoritative vs Non-Authoritative servers**:
  - Authoritative = holds real data
  - Non-authoritative = cached info only
- **DNS Caching** happens both client- and server-side
- **Internal DNS** should never expose internal names (e.g., `pc1.corp.local`) to external internet
- **DoT (port 853)** and **DoH (port 443)** encrypt DNS queries to avoid snooping or tampering
- **DNSSEC**: digitally signs records with a **Zone Signing Key**, validated by a **Key Signing Key**, ensuring integrity

🔒 Reminder: DNS is a huge attack surface. Everything from spoofing to poisoning to eavesdropping happens here. Harden it or regret it.

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

This morning, I felt prepared to return to the Network+ course after pausing for a few days to complete Cloud+ for the summer.  
I was also feeling a bit overwhelmed and questioning myself about my progress and understanding.

But I realized something important: I need to slow down, start asking questions, and work through problems on my own first—then get help when needed. From there, I’ll document everything with clear understanding so it sticks long-term.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection

Today’s Network+ progress was strong. I completed **two hands-on labs**:  
- **6.4.8 Troubleshoot IP Configuration 1**  
- **6.4.9 Troubleshoot IP Configuration 2**

These helped reinforce IP configuration concepts—especially troubleshooting DHCP, default gateways, and spotting APIPA addresses in the wild. I feel more confident analyzing `ipconfig` output and tracing issues step by step.

After the labs, I jumped into the **DNS theory section (6.5)** and made major progress. Sections **6.5.1 through 6.5.10** are now complete with notes and deeper understanding. I especially liked learning about DNS caching, recursive vs iterative lookups, and the different record types like SOA, NS, A, MX, TXT, and more.

🧠 Tomorrow I’ll begin **Lab 6.5.11 - Configure DNS Addresses**, then continue on with the rest of Lesson 6 and try to reach Lesson 7.

🧠 **Key takeaway**: DNS isn’t magic—it's a hierarchy of referrals and records. Misconfiguration can break access across a network. Testing, verifying TTLs, and understanding name resolution flow is essential for real-world troubleshooting.
