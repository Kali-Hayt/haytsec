# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-07-31
## 🔥 Focus of the Day

My focus today is to stay consistent with my Network+ assignments and knock out as many as possible; the due date is closing in fast. I’ll try to review HaytSec later this evening if there’s time, but coursework takes priority. Bedtime needs to be early — tomorrow is a half-day away from study, and I want to be rested and ready.

## ✍️ Morning Journal / Reflection

I’m feeling clear-headed and solid this morning. I’m ready to knock down a whole bunch of Network+ assignments today and catch up on what I’ve fallen behind on. The course is wrapping up soon, so I need to move faster and stay consistent. My goal is to get to bed early tonight for tomorrow’s half-day of errands.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection

Today was a solid day of progress with Network+. I finished all of **Lesson 7** and reached **Lesson 8.3** The material on scanning was steady and made sense. It felt productive, and I learned a few new things.

My goal is to **keep consistency with Network+ assignments** — the final exam is getting closer. I’m aiming to **complete all the material by August 10th or 11th** so I can be ready.

Wrapping up early tonight to rest. I’ve got errands tomorrow, but I’ll be back to it later in the day.
