## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  
I woke up later than planned—well past my ideal schedule—but instead of spiraling, I paused, reset, and launched the day intentionally. This isn’t a loss, it’s a pivot. My goals are time-sensitive, but I refuse to panic. I’ll move with intensity now, and rest once the mission is done.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up-Journal / Reflection  

Today was a sprint—from around **4.3 to 5.2**, I pushed through a heavy block of routing theory, tools, and CLI lab work. It wasn’t perfect, and I didn’t linger where things got messy—but I moved forward, and that was the goal. I plan to review my notes more deeply when the exam gets closer.

I understood most of what I covered, but I’ll definitely need more practice with certain areas—especially routing logic and protocol behavior. That said, I retained a ton of information in a short amount of time. The labs helped a lot.

Time is short, so I need to move with purpose. Tomorrow is all about getting through **5.2 to 7.5**, taking solid notes as I go. It’s not about rushing or skipping—it’s about moving forward, capturing what matters, and staying focused. I’m not trying to cram or perfect every detail—I’ll deepen my understanding later. Right now, it’s about making progress, locking in what I can, and keeping up the momentum.
