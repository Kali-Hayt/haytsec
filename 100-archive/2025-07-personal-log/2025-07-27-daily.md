## 🔥 Focus of the Day  

Today’s focus is to close out the Cloud+ course for the summer by taking the final exam, then prepare a Networking+ study plan to start on Monday. After that, I plan to enjoy some well-earned free time by working on the HaytSec project, setting up my own automation environment, and learning new tools like VS Code or Vim. Whether it’s scripting system routines or refining my terminal workflow, today is about finishing strong and investing in what comes next.

### ✅ Achieved

I have successfully completed the CompTIA Cloud+ preparation course for the summer term. Throughout the course, I gained foundational knowledge of cloud infrastructure, virtualization, security principles, and cloud deployment models.

This course has equipped me with the essential concepts and practical skills necessary to prepare for the Cloud+ certification exam.

Completing this course marks a critical step in my journey toward becoming a proficient cloud security professional, and I am committed to continuing my study and hands-on practice to achieve full certification.

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

I’m feeling confident heading into the Cloud+ exam today after a focused warm-up review. It feels good knowing I pushed through and completed the entire certification prep course in just seven weeks.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection

After finishing my Cloud+ exam—a much-needed milestone—I finally had some free time to unwind and have fun customizing my terminals on my system. It felt great to tinker and personalize my setup, a perfect way to reset the mind.

Now, my goal is to get a good rest tonight so I can dive into my Networking course tomorrow, dedicating the whole day to it with fresh energy and focus.
