# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-07-29

## 🔥 Focus of the Day  

Today my main focus is to finish up Lesson 6 in Network+. I’ve covered most of the DNS content and plan to complete the final sections and make sure everything clicks. Once that’s done, I want to start pushing into Lesson 7 and keep the momentum going.

The HaytSec project might take a backseat today. I’ll keep it light and just review where I left off—maybe check over some documentation before I wrap up tonight.

## 🎯 Goals

- [x] Complete Network+ Lesson 6.5.11-Lab (Current)
- [ ] Complete Network+ Lesson 6 (~)
- [ ] Complete Network+ Lesson 7 (~)
- [ ] HaytSec Project (Deffered)

### ✅ Achieved
1. **6.5.11** – Configure DNS Zones  
   - Created a primary zone and understood DNS zone types (primary, secondary, stub).
2. **6.5.12** – Configure Zone Transfers  
   - Enabled secure zone transfers to allow data sync between DNS servers.
3. **6.5.13** – Create Host Records  
   - Created A and PTR records for multiple hosts in CorpNet.local.
---
## 🧠 Notes & Learnings
- Always create the **reverse lookup zone first** to auto-link PTR records.
- A record = hostname ➡️ IP  
  PTR record = IP ➡️ hostname
- Zone transfers help DNS servers **share data** and **improve fault tolerance**.

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  

Studying all night isn’t sustainable. I need to develop better balance and make it a priority to get to bed on time. While the motivation to push through late-night sessions is there, it ends up hurting my focus, energy, and productivity the next day. A consistent routine will help me retain more and stay sharp throughout my study schedule.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up Journal / Reflection

Completed a few DNS labs today, including zone creation, zone transfers, and host record setup. Made a small mistake early on but fixed it and got everything working correctly.

Learned more about how A and PTR records work, when to create reverse zones, and how to verify DNS with tools like `nslookup`.

I’m starting to see how it all connects in a real network.
