## ✅ What I Completed  

Completed all of **Lesson 5** throughout the day — a heavy, content-rich module with deep technical material. Also made it into **Lesson 6**, but paused there to rest and wrap up.

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings  

- Lesson 5 required full focus: VLANs, trunking, CLI switch config, and management concepts were dense but essential.
- Structuring notes and quizzes in markdown made the learning more durable and easier to revisit.
- Labs clarified the practical differences between GUI and CLI VLAN creation and switch interface setup.
- Staying disciplined with journaling and tagging pays off when the content load is high.
- Stopped at the beginning of Lesson 6 to rest and reset. Tomorrow’s target: advance through Lesson 6 and aim for strong progress on **Lesson 7**.

## ✍️ Morning-Journal / Reflection  
I made strong progress on my Network+ coursework yesterday and built solid momentum. Today is about finishing the remaining assignments due by the end of the day. With the deadline approaching, I’m staying focused and eliminating distractions to ensure I complete everything on time. The goal is mastery and consistency—time to deliver.

## ✍️ Wrap-Up-Journal / Reflection  

Didn’t finish all tasks, but completed the majority of today's workload — from early morning through to the end of Lesson 5, and began Lesson 6. Made steady progress through 5.7.4, the 5.8 module quiz, and the surrounding review materials.

The volume of information is heavy, but the structure I’ve built is helping maintain clarity and momentum. Journaling and organized note-taking continue to be key tools in managing the pace.

Shutting down for rest. Tomorrow, I’ll resume with the goal of finishing most remaining items — aiming to complete up through the end of Lesson 7.
