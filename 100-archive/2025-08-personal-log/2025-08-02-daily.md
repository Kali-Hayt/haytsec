# 🗓️ Daily Log — 2025-08-02
## 🔥 Focus of the Day
- Stay consistent with **Network+ assignments**
- Complete as much as possible without losing focus
- Review and update the **HaytSec project** if time allows
- Continue **Hack The Box** practice to stay sharp
---
## 🎯 Goals

- [x] Complete Network+ Lesson 8
- [ ] Complete Network+ Lesson 9 (Deffered)
- [x] HaytSec Project 

---
## ✅ Achieved-Network+

### 📘 Lesson 8: Network Monitoring and Optimization  
**Started at:** 8.3 Monitoring Tools  
**Completed through:** 8.7 SIEM and Logging  

---

### 🔹 8.3 – Monitoring Tools  
- Reviewed SNMP, agents, traps, polling  
- Compared agent-based vs agentless monitoring  
- Understood centralized logging and alerting tools

### 🔹 8.4 – Metrics, Logging, and Traffic Analysis  
- Covered baseline metrics (utilization, errors, latency)  
- Identified trends, anomalies, and data patterns  
- Understood log types and where they originate

### 🔹 8.5 – Diagrams and Documentation  
- Learned the value of cable maps, network schematics  
- Covered labeling best practices  
- Recognized the impact of poor documentation on troubleshooting

### 🔹 8.6 – Performance Monitoring and Optimization  
- ✅ 8.6.1–8.6.6: Concepts like jitter, shaping, policing, DiffServ  
- ✅ 8.6.7: **Lab – Configure QoS on pfSense**  
  - Created `HighBW` alias  
  - Set shaping priorities for Guest Wi-Fi  
  - Applied PRIQ and penalty boxes  
  - Edited floating rules for MSRDP port

### 🔹 8.6.8–8.6.9 – Lesson Review  
- Completed 15 performance review questions  
- ✅ Corrections reviewed and concepts reinforced

### 🔹 8.7 – SIEM and Event Management  
- Finished full **30-question module quiz**  
- ✅ All answers converted to Obsidian-ready Markdown  
- ✅ Included metaphors (log aggregation = “cooking with multiple kitchens”)  
- Reviewed SNMP, log normalization, correlation, availability monitoring, and QoS planes

---

### 🧠 Total Today:
- ✅ 5 sub-lessons  
- ✅ 1 lab  
- ✅ 45+ review and quiz questions  
- ✅ All documented, explained, and corrected

---
## 🧠 Notes & Learnings – Network+ Lesson 8  

### ✅ What I Covered
- **8.3 to 8.7** completed in one day
- Includes performance tools, QoS, SIEM, and full lab

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Monitoring Tools**  
  - SNMP = used for polling and alerts  
  - Agent-based vs agentless monitoring

- **Logging & Metrics**  
  - Look for trends, errors, latency  
  - Log types: system, application, security

- **Diagrams & Documentation**  
  - Cable maps, labels, schematics = make troubleshooting easier  
  - Don’t overload one diagram — split by layer

- **Performance Optimization**  
  - Latency = delay  
  - Jitter = inconsistent delay  
  - Packet loss = missing data  
  - Use tools like NetFlow, iperf, and top talkers to find issues

- **Traffic Shaping & QoS**  
  - DiffServ tags traffic (AF, EF, BE)  
  - 802.1p works at Layer 2 (VLAN priority)  
  - Traffic shaping = delay/buffer  
  - Traffic policing = drop excess traffic  
  - Lab: Configured pfSense shaper, added alias + queues

- **SIEM & Log Management**  
  - Log aggregation = collect logs from many systems  
  - Normalization = standardize format  
  - Use SIEM for alerting, correlation, and dashboards

---

### 💡 What Helped Me Understand
- Log aggregation = like collecting ingredients from different kitchens to cook one meal  
- Prioritizing VoIP traffic helped me understand why QoS matters  
- Labeling cables makes a huge difference in real environments

## ✍️ Morning Journal / Reflection

I allowed myself to sleep in this morning to ensure adequate rest. I’m feeling well-prepared for a full day of focused work and intend to keep the day productive and manageable. To maintain energy and avoid burnout, I plan to step out briefly for groceries, take a proper lunch break, and rest if needed later in the day. One of my key objectives is to reserve time this evening for reviewing the HaytSec project and continuing Hack The Box practice.

---
## 🌙 Late Evening Reflection  

Today I successfully completed **Lesson 8 of Network+**, including all subtopics, lab activities, and review material — ✅ goal of the day achieved.

With that milestone checked off, I’m shifting into light evening work:

- Reviewing the current structure and notes within **HaytSec**  
- Continuing progress on **Hack The Box** for practical reinforcement

The remainder of the evening will be focused on rest and preparation.  
My goal is to start **Lesson 9 – Remote Access** early tomorrow and maintain consistent forward progress.

Discipline and steady effort are key — staying on track, one section at a time.
