## üß† Notes & Learnings ‚Äì Network+

# Section 12.1
### üõ∞ Wireless Standards & Frequency Bands
- 802.11a = 5 GHz, faster but less range  
- 802.11b/g = 2.4 GHz, slower but better penetration  
- 802.11n = introduced MIMO and channel bonding (40 MHz)  
- 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) = DL MU-MIMO, up to 4 devices  
- 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) = DL+UL MU-MIMO, up to 8 devices, 10 Gbps target  
### üì° Band Steering
- Band steering pushes dual-band clients to 5 GHz for better performance.
### üì∂ Channel Bonding
- Combines two 20 MHz into one 40 MHz channel (802.11n) for higher throughput.
### üì± Cellular & Satellite
- 4G/5G require SIM card to authenticate  
- Cellular base station range: up to 5 miles (8 km)  
- LEO satellites = lower latency, but require tracking due to movement  
# Section 12.3
### Wireless Encryption Standards
- WEP: Weak and deprecated; vulnerable to replay attacks.
- WPA: Introduced TKIP to address WEP flaws.
- WPA2: Uses AES with CCMP for strong encryption.
- WPA3: Uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) for stronger mutual authentication.
### Authentication Methods
- Personal (PSK): Shared passphrase generates PMK (Pairwise Master Key).
- Enterprise (802.1X): Uses RADIUS server; access point forwards authentication data.
### Guest Networks & Captive Portals
- Guest networks isolate visitors from internal resources.
- Captive portals require users to authenticate through a browser interface.
### BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Environments
- EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) enforces security policies on personal devices.
- Primary goal: manage and secure diverse device types connecting to the network.
### Wireless Network Attacks
- Evil Twin: Fake AP mimicking legitimate SSID to lure users.
- Rogue AP: Unauthorized access point connected to the network.
- Replay Attack: Resends captured traffic to break WEP/WPA encryption.
- VPN: Encrypts traffic over untrusted/open networks.
## Wireless Intrusion Prevention (WIPS)
- Protects against excessive wireless requests.
- Temporarily blocks clients with repeated authentication failures.
- Detects rogue DHCP servers and malicious APs.
### Key Derivation in Enterprise Authentication
- WPA2: Uses 4-way handshake to generate session keys.
- WPA3: Uses SAE methods to securely establish session keys.
# Section 12.4
- Reviewed key wireless troubleshooting concepts (12.4.1‚Äì12.4.10)  
- Completed all three wireless labs: explored, troubleshot, and optimized WLANs  
- Identified overcapacity and roaming issues as common real-world problems  
- Reinforced understanding of interference, channel overlap, and coverage gaps  
- Knocked out 12.5 Module Quiz and 12.6 Checkpoint Review (20 Qs)  
- Noticed test trick questions ‚Äî especially on reserved IP ranges and IoT protocols  
- Logged progress toward mastering wireless and physical layer troubleshooting

## ‚úçÔ∏è Morning Journal / Reflection  

This morning began with noticeable fatigue due to insufficient sleep. Although I went to bed later than planned, I made the deliberate choice to wake up early in order to prepare for the day rather than allowing myself to sleep in. I recognize the importance of establishing and maintaining a consistent routine of early mornings and early nights.

Despite the rough start, I feel confident in my ability to meet today's goals and anticipate ending the evening with a sense of accomplishment. As the Network+ course approaches completion, I am focused on finishing strong before taking a brief, restorative break ahead of the upcoming fall semester.

## üåô Late Evening Reflection  

This evening, I completed all of Lesson 12 in the Network+ curriculum, covering sections 12.1 through 12.6. This included all reading content, interactive labs, simulations, the module quiz, and the checkpoint review. Although I was mentally fatigued from lack of sleep, I remained focused and followed through on my study objectives for the day.

I plan to rest briefly now to recover, then begin setting up my new computer hardware. This will include installing a new monitor mount and adjusting my workstation layout. Once the setup is complete, I will return to Hack The Box for several hours of focused practice and hands-on exploitation work.

Study is complete for the moment, with steady progress maintained.
