## 🧠 Notes & Learnings – Network+
# Section 13.1
- **WAN vs LAN** → WAN covers greater distances, often uses public telecom infrastructure.  
- **Physical Layer (WAN)** → Often uses modems for modulation/demodulation; can be analog or digital.  
- **Data Link Layer (WAN)** → Simpler protocols than LAN; often point-to-point.  
- **Network Layer (WAN)** → CE router connects customer network to provider; provider assigns IP addresses.  
- **Public networks** → Chosen mainly for cost savings over private solutions.  
- **T-carrier (T1)** → Uses Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to carry multiple channels on one line.  
- **DSL** → Uses phone lines; requires splitters to avoid interference; ADSL = asymmetrical, SDSL = symmetrical.  
- **Cable Internet** → Uses coax + DOCSIS standard; connects through CMTS.  
- **FTTC** → Fiber to cabinet, copper last segment; usually uses VDSL.  
- **FTTP** → Fiber directly to premises; uses Optical Network Terminal (ONT) to convert optical to Ethernet.
# Section 13.2
- **13.2.1 Remote Access Considerations** → Remote access = indirect network connection (often VPN). Needs authentication, access restrictions, logging, and up-to-date hardware/software.
- **13.2.2 Tunneling Protocols** → Tunneling wraps private packets inside public ones. PPP (Layer 2, no security), GRE (Layer 3, no auth), IPSec (secure, Layer 3), TLS/DTLS (secure but more overhead).
- **13.2.3 IPSec** → AH = integrity/authentication only, ESP = encryption + integrity. Two modes: Transport (payload only) and Tunnel (entire packet).
- **13.2.4 IKE** → Negotiates IPSec security settings and keys. Phase I = secure channel + authentication. Phase II = sets ciphers/keys. IKEv2 adds mobility, NAT traversal, EAP support.
- **13.2.5 Client-to-Site VPNs** → Remote workers connect to corporate gateway. Uses SSTP, L2TP/IPSec, or SSL/TLS. Split tunnel = faster but less secure; full tunnel = secure but slower.
- **13.2.6 Clientless VPNs** → No client software; works via browser (HTML5, WebSockets). Often used for remote desktop or app access.
- **13.2.7 Site-to-Site VPNs** → Connects whole networks via gateways. Can be static (always on) or dynamic (on demand). Works over internet or private WAN; also for local segmentation.

## 🌤️ Early Evening Journal

I slept in most of the morning to catch up on rest after staying up all night assembling my lab setup. Woke up feeling refreshed and proud of the new setup. This afternoon, I headed to San Diego City College to take care of a few things. It was a good day — got my tasks completed and lined up a few more to follow up on before diving into studying.

## 🌙 Late Evening Journal

After a productive day addressing other priorities, I began my Network+ studies later in the evening. Despite the later start, I was able to maintain focus and work through several assignments, advancing steadily until reaching the **13.2.8 lab activities**, which are set aside for tomorrow’s session.  

As the night winds down, I’m choosing to rest and recharge, ensuring I have the energy and clarity needed for another full and productive day ahead. Consistency and balance remain the key to sustaining progress in this certification journey.
